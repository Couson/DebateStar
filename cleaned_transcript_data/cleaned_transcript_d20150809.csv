0,Michèle Flournoy,"Well, I certainly hope so, but to be fair, you know, the administration has a lot on its plate right now. This little thing called the Iran deal, getting that through Congress, concluding an historic trade deal in Asia, but I'm confident that once those two things are taken care of this will move to the top of the president's nightstand reading pile."
1,Michèle Flournoy,Yes.
2,Michèle Flournoy,My partner is the brilliant Philip Zelikow.
3,Philip Zelikow,"I'm afraid, John, it's not common enough, which is a shame, because I think presidents need all the help that they can get."
4,Dov Zakheim,It shows you how well we prepared.
5,Dov Zakheim,Not anymore.
6,Dov Zakheim,"Yeah, there were seven of us, not including Mr. Spock, who advised George W. Bush when he was running for president. Of course, some people would say it would've help if Spock advised him, but the group was actually set up by Condi Rice, who is no stranger to Aspen, and it was named after the statue of the God Vulcan in Birmingham. And since we had no say in it, we became Vulcans."
7,Michèle Flournoy,"So I'm arguing for the proposition that ISIS must be defeated. ISIS is more than a terrorist organization. It is a proto‐state, an ideological movement that is committed to undertake Jihad against anyone who rejects its abhorrent ideology. Its ultimate aim is to establish a territorial caliphate that stretches across the Muslim world. ISIS is brutal in the extreme. It has beheaded innocent civilians. It has burned a captured Jordanian pilot alive in a cage. It rapes women and girls and sells them into sexual slavery. It crucifies Christians. It desecrates and destroys Holy sites and antiquities. Over the last year ISIS has established a very substantial safe haven in Iraq and Syria, and it has recruited more than 22,000 foreign fighters from more than 100 countries. The scale and scope of this mobilization is unprecedented. Thousands of these fighters have Western passports that would allow them to travel back to Europe and to the United States without a visa. ISIS ‐‐ its geographic ambitions are not limited to the Middle East. This is a globalizing movement. In the last year ISIS has sought to establish footprints in places from Libya to Afghanistan, Nigeria, the Caucasus, even Southeast Asia. Holding territory is critical to its momentum and its legitimacy. It has also established a global presence on the internet using online means to disseminate its propaganda, recruit and radicalize followers, inspire lone‐wolf attacks. Again, the scale is eye‐watering. 90,000 social media messages each day. 90,000 a day. In some ways, ISIS could become more dangerous than Al‐Qaeda. Al‐Qaeda used to assert very strict control over who became an affiliate. ISIS says, ""Let a thousand flowers bloom. If we can inspire individuals to conduct attacks around the world, that's great.” In fact, 10 of the 11 attacks conducted in the West since May of 2014 have been by lone wolves. ISIS has also conducted attacks not only in the Middle East, but in Canada, Australia, France, Denmark, and yes, here in the United States. In all 50 states today, there are active investigations or arrests of ISIS. If ever there was a terrorist group that we must defeat, it is ISIS. Now, defeating ISIS will require an intensive ‐‐ more intensive and fully resourced campaign on the part of the United States and our international partners. We need to intensify our diplomacy and our military support to Sunni and other partners so that they can be empowered to defeat ISIS on the ground. Politically, that means we need intensified diplomacy to press the Shi'a government in Baghdad, to address Sunni grievances, to devolve more authorities and resources to the provinces, to move towards a more federal and just Iraq. In Syria, we need a more robust diplomatic effort to set the conditions for what should eventually become a negotiated settlement that removes Assad from power. We need increased international engagement to try to keep the civil war in Syria from destabilizing neighboring states, like Jordan, and Lebanon, and Turkey. Militarily, in Iraq we need to provide more support, trainers, combat advisers, equipment, close air support, to local partners on the ground who can take on ISIS and take back territory. To be clear, I am not ‐‐ we are not arguing for a large‐scale U.S. military invasion of Iraq. We are not calling for a repeat of the Iraq War. We are calling for intensified support to partners. In Syria ‐‐ we need to shift our emphasis to producing more support to some of the groups that are already having success on the ground, like the Southern Front and the Syrian Free Army. We also need to refashion our Train and Equip program to try to get towards the goal of a more viable alternative to ISIS in a post‐Assad Syria. Thinking globally, we also need to combat ISIS using the full range of tools that we've developed for counterterrorism, disrupting their financing, targeting their leadership, building their capacity of partners in other countries to try to keep ISIS from moving in. We need to work with private sector and NGO partners to combat them online. And we need to address some more fundamental conditions that create fertile soil for ISIS, such as poor governance and community grievance. This will not be without risk. But I would argue, the risk of inaction are even greater. The other team will argue that containment is a better option. I will tell you that containment won't work. Containment means allowing ISIS to hold on to sanctuary. It means ISIS will be able to continue to plan attacks, recruit followers, inspire lone wolves. Containment would be a recipe for endless terrorist attacks in the West and instability in the Middle East. Is that a future we really want? It's not a future I want my children to live in. If there's anything we should have learned from 9/11, it is that we must not allow a terrorist organization like this to have sanctuary in the heart of the Middle East or elsewhere. Now is the time to do more, to act with our partners, to defeat ISIS. Thank you."
8,Philip Zelikow,"Tough issue, but I want to start where Anne‐Marie Slaughter left off. She said injecting the United States into this conflict confirms their narrative. As if we're not injected already? As if we're not conducting air strikes against them every single day? As if we're not, as the Deputy Secretary of State has said, ""We've already killed 10,000 of their members, but it has not declined."" In other words, we're already injected. We're already fighting, we're just not beating them. That confirms their narrative. That confirms their narrative of victory. Their crusaders attack us every day. That's the way they put it. And here we are controlling 20 cities, ruling millions of people, and enslaving more. Let's talk about what failure looks like. Sure, failure looks like hundreds or thousands of Americans dead after an attack that could come next month, next year, or the year after that. The 9/11 attack that I studied gestated for three years before they laid waste to southern Manhattan. The people who carried out that attack migrated from Germany to Afghanistan nearly two years before the attack. They went there, by the way, thinking that they were going to go fight Russians in Chechnya, but the leadership found other uses for them. So failure looks like hundreds or thousands of Americans dead with more violence in Europe, but failure also looks like the descent of the Middle East into the full war of extremes in which its all against all, in which its Shia extremists supported by Iran and Sunni extremists for whom ISIS is the terrifying sort of purity and Lebanon crumples and Jordan crumples and Turkey begins to crumple, all already awash with millions of displaced people. All are already failing to cope. Their societies already sagging under the weight of the burdens. Saudi Arabia destabilized as more and more Sunnis find that that's really the extreme version of their own ideology that they want to follow. Don't you think that that's the point that the U.S. has to reinvade the Middle East? That's failure. U.S. reinvasion of the Middle East is failure. That's the failure Michèle Flournoy and I are against. That's why you need to adopt this resolution and defeat ISIS so that we don’t have to reinvade the Middle East. What then does success look like? Success looks like defeating their message. What's their message? It's a message about power. We empower the weak Sunni Muslims and we empower them through the exclusive divine mission they hold and the terrifying sword they wield in the territory we rule, ruling despite the crusader's attacks against us. So what does success look like? It's Sunni Muslims liberating their own lands. It's Sunni Muslims recovering self‐determination. So what's the strategy to do that? It's a political strategy first and foremost, because the public debate in America is mostly about should we do more militarily. That's wrong. Michèle and I both believe, know the strategy leads politically and it needs to be a strategy that appeals to Sunni Muslims, because they're the ones we want to do most of the fighting to keep Americans from having to do most of the fighting later on. Why will they fight? They will fight to free themselves, to free themselves from the Assad tyranny in Syria where we also must join that fight and end the Syrian Civil War, which is destroying the region and bringing it close to the brink of apocalypse. That's the kind of message that appeals to Turkey and brings them in on our side and units Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis of Lebanon and the millions of Syrians in refugee camps who want to return to their homes. Because, you see, ISIS is not homegrown. ISIS are foreigners. The ISIS rulers in Syria are led by Iraqis and veterans of Saddam Hussein's gestapo and they recruit Uzbeks and Chechens to run their shock troops in Mosul. Many of the Iraqi recruits that they enslave into their service don't even understand the command language that they're hearing on the radio. So the political strategy is a self‐determination of Sunni Muslims. And the military strategy, advise and support so they can do the job, but it's a tough job. They have to retake cities. To do that kind of urban warfare requires just the kind of assets that only the United States has. Think about urban combat and what you need, armored vehicles that aren't going to be blown up by an IED as easily, jammers to diffuse the IEDs, snipers who can provide over watch, communication so that you know what's going on in the block two blocks away from you, medivac capabilities that give you the confidence your wounded can be treated and helicopters and fires that can be brought to bear on the targets you see in front of you. Those are assets only the United States can provide, which gives them the confidence and the sense that we're in this with them that allows you to build a coalition founded on Sunni Muslims doing the job to liberate their own lands, because containment doesn't keep the U.S. out. It guarantees the U.S. is likely to come in. Anne‐Marie said it at last. Let ideology crumble itself. Did the Khmer Rouge crumble itself? No, the Vietnamese had to invade Cambodia. Did the Taliban crumble itself? Did al‐Qaeda in Pakistan crumble itself? Has the North Korean tyranny crumbled itself? No. You have to beat terror with something else and in this case the something else is defeating terror where it has taken root in ISIS. Support the resolution."
9,Dov Zakheim,"Thanks very much and I really want to thank Phil, because he just made my argument. We have armed ISIS. What do you think they're using? American personnel carriers. American tanks. American ammunition. Why? Because we've done such a fantastic job training the Iraqis and we've been doing it for over a decade, and we've done an equally good job training the Afghans. That's why they're doing so well. And in fact, if you look at who we've trained in Syria, we have a $500 million program that thus far has spat out 60 fighters, 60. That's less than that side of the room. Of which, and I hope this doesn't happen to any of you all, a whole bunch have already been captured. So let's step back and look at what it really takes to beat these folks and to do something other than to contain them the way my brilliant colleague, Anne‐Marie Slaughter ‐‐ ‐‐ laid out for you. You know, this isn't the first outburst of Islamic extremism. For instance, in the 12th Century there was a fanatical group that actually had the same ideology as these guys called the Almohads. And how were they defeated? By massive forces of Christian troops coming down from northern Spain. In the 18th Century, the original Wahhabis who had made a deal with the first , basically same kind of ideology. They were defeated by Turkish forces, and then we had the same sort of thing again in the late 19th Century when Lord Kitchener, then General Kitchener, amassed a huge force to defeat the Mahdi in Sudan. What's the common denominator? Lots of troops. Not a few thousand. Not a bunch of spotters, because oh, by the way, when the Israelis couldn't beat Hezbollah in 2006, they didn't have a problem with spotters. And when we tried to bomb Vietnam to the Stone Age in the 1960s, with Rolling Thunder, we didn't have a problem with spotters. Spotters aren't the issue. The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend the money to do that? We're living under a strange thing called a sequester. Somebody was asked on television, ""What's a sequester?"" And he answered, ""It's the capital of Portugal."" People don't even know what a sequester is. But what it's done is limit our spending. And you talk to Secretary of Defense Carter and he rightly says he's being constrained all over the place. The president says it. So, where are we going to find the money ‐‐ even if we had the will, which I don't think we have ‐‐ to go and fund all these troops, or even to do what Philip says. All the things you want to give these folks ‐‐ let's assume they don't fall into ISIS's hands. Where are we going to find the money for it? Do we have the will? Do we have the money? Do we have the staying power for that kind of thing? The only way you're going to stop these guys is if, indeed, they rot from within. That's the only alternative if you're not going to send hundreds of thousands of troops in. And to get them to rot from within, you have to contain them. You've got to keep them cooped up. And there are ways to do that. But we're not even in one mind as to how to right now. Yes, we love the Kurds, but we don't arm them. Yes, we want to work with the Turks, except the Turks have a different agenda. They want to bomb the Kurds, who we like. I mean, you need a scorecard to figure out who exactly is on your side. How do you beat these people that way? The bottom line is ‐‐ unless we have a coherent major military strategy, the real alternative ‐‐ when you parse out all the stuff about what we can do right now, the real alternative is to keep them cooped up, to arm our friends, to figure out how to train those who will fight. And yes, the Sunnis might fight. But guess what? They haven't fought until now. We've been begging them for years. Saudi Arabia is fighting, except not in Syria, not in Iraq. They're fighting in Yemen. And they're not doing that hot a job there either. So, we have to figure out how to motivate those we want to work with us. And that's going to take time. And what do we do in the meantime? We've got to contain ISIS for as long as possible. And if we could beat the Soviet Union, I wouldn't bet the family farm against our beating ISIS. Thank you."
10,Michèle Flournoy,"I think that it's something that ‐‐ it's important to understand ‐‐ is in order to break their narrative of victory, you have to roll‐back territory. You have to take territory away from ISIS. And the way in which we're arguing to do that is to look to the actors who do have the political will to fight, but have not been given the support or conditions. So, for example, this is not about trying to retrain a largely Shi'a Iraqi security forces to go into Sunni areas. What we need to do is, first, with a political strategy, push the Iraqi government towards a policy of inclusion of the Sunnis. If the exclusion and the persecution of the Sunni populations ‐‐ that has created the fertile soil for a group like ISIS to come in. They are willing to fight because it's their home territories. But they need two conditions. One is they need to know that after they fight and shed blood to kick ISIS out, they will be in a different Iraq, that they will have some prospect for self‐governance and support, and that re‐inclusion in the Iraqi society. And number two, they have to know that they're fully supported, that we have their back, that someone has their back. And here, it's not a matter of U.S., you know, brigades and divisions. It's a matter of giving them not only trainers on a base, but combat advisers who will help advise them when they're in contact with ISIS."
11,Dov Zakheim,"Yeah. A couple of things on that. First, we've been promising this to the Sunnis for a long time in Iraq. Why should they believe us? Number one. We haven't done it until now. And who knows if we can do it?"
12,Philip Zelikow,"Dov, that's not true. We did it in 2007 and 2008."
13,Dov Zakheim,Absolutely right.
14,Philip Zelikow,I saw it.
15,Dov Zakheim,You saw it. And where are we today?
16,Dov Zakheim,We walked away from it and ‐‐
17,Dov Zakheim,‐‐ the problem is ‐‐
18,Dov Zakheim,"‐‐ this is problem is ‐‐ and this is our problem in the Middle East ‐‐ you know, remember we backed the Shah 1,000 percent? Ask the Shah where he is these days. Pushing up daisies. The fact of the matter is we have made promise after promise. And let me tell you something else. This whole fight we have with the Israelis? Do you think the Arabs look at that and say, ""My God. They double‐crossed Mubarak. They double‐crossed the Shah. They're double‐crossing the Israelis. Can we really trust them?"" Yes. You were right. What you did in '07 and '08 was absolutely right. What has happened since then? And by the way, let's look at Syria. Who did the Syrians want to fight first? ISIS or"
19,Dov Zakheim,We ‐‐
20,Dov Zakheim,"Absolutely. The point is that if you're talking about bucking up people to fight against ISIS, you don't have the people to buck up because we don't have the credibility to buck them up. Does that come to the point?"
21,Dov Zakheim,Can't happen.
22,Philip Zelikow,"We're not saying the status quo works. The resolution is not supporting the status quo. So that's a ‐‐ but what we're saying is to change the status quo you have to lead with a different political strategy. So, that promises the Sunnis the self‐government. Yes, many of them feel betrayed. They feel betrayed because the U.S. did not have their back after 2008, for various reasons. And so, you have to give them a situation in which they are the dominant population in Syria. That's majority rule in Syria. And then in Iraq, therefore, a protected minority, up in the north and in the south. And that's doable. In fact, the Iraqi prime minister, for the first time, with the council of ministers, has moved forward, with U.S. pressure, and the laws that would actually put in place the devolution of power down to the provinces to an unprecedented level combined with a constitution that would give those provinces the money proportionately to their population out of the Iraqi budget. Combine that with the kind of military support Michèle refers to and then you have a strategy that's realistic. But think about the alternative."
23,Philip Zelikow,Do you give up on them and let it go?
24,Philip Zelikow,"But the point was can they fight? Yeah, they can fight. If you give them the kind of support, they've proven it. What they want above all is to fight to control their own homes. Is that a realistic goal? Yeah. That's a realistic goal. That's the goal of national liberation. That's not what we were fighting in Vietnam ‐‐"
25,Dov Zakheim,"Well, first of all we're not talking about patience here. I thought Anne‐Marie laid it out very well. We do want to keep pushing them. Nobody said to stop even the bombing. We continue with that. We arm the Kurds. We do train. The point is all of that is not going to defeat ISIS. It's going to contain ISIS. That's the point and it's going to take time. It's going to take time to recover from the fact that since 2008 when you were last there and doing what you did, we are now in 2015. Seven years and by your own statement in those seven years we have not progressed. It takes time and you have to contain and do the things we're talking about and that you're talking about. I'm still convinced that the reason we sound so similar is they're making the best case for us."
26,Michèle Flournoy,No we aren't.
27,Michèle Flournoy,"I mean, I think that ‐‐ because I think Anne‐Marie said, containment is really holding them where they are and we are saying holding them where we are is not enough, because as long as they have the territory they have they will continue to have momentum. They will continue to recruit. They will have a basis from which to launch operations and eventually there will be attacks of significance on the United States. The containment is a recipe for increasing risk and cost to the United States. So yes, the containment may be an initial phase on the way to defeat, but we have to proactively roll ‐‐ keep ‐‐ prevent them from spreading elsewhere and roll them back where they do spread. Not by going in by ourselves, all by ourselves, but by empowering the local populations who have the political will, the legitimacy, but maybe not the means and support they need to be effective."
28,Michèle Flournoy,I don't think we need to have a U.S. brand. I think the most legitimacy ‐‐ the people we should be supporting in the fight against ISIS are the Sunni ‐‐ the vast majority of Sunnis in the world who are just as appalled by them and find them just as abhorrent as we do except they're living with them.
29,Michèle Flournoy,We have not adequately resourced ‐‐
30,Philip Zelikow,"There are two key flaws in this argument. First, we have not adequately resourced or tried advise and support. So before you get to that argument the only thing that will work is a U.S. invasion. Can we at least just try a proper strategy of advice and support? And give it a try because the second flaw in their argument is this, they assume that this is a stable equilibrium, that a devastated Syria with half the population displaced and millions of people in refugee camps in all the surrounding states ‐‐ that can be stably maintained for who knows how long to come. They can just stand on that tightrope for hours and hours. We're saying they know they can't stay on that tightrope. Eventually they're going to fall off that tightrope and then you ask yourself which way do you think that goes as the Middle East descends into all out religious war."
31,Dov Zakheim,"Look. Look. Resources, $500 million bucks to train 60 people. That's a tremendous payout."
32,Philip Zelikow,Because we wouldn't fight Assad. That's why we could attract new recruits.
33,Dov Zakheim,Okay. So do you want to fight Assad? Now you want to fight a two‐front war.
34,Philip Zelikow,‐‐ Syrian civil war.
35,Dov Zakheim,"You want to fight both sides. That's great. Well, I hope we figure out which side we shoot at first."
36,Philip Zelikow,That's how you bring the Sunni coalition together.
37,Dov Zakheim,"Hang on. You want to put ‐‐ first of all, how much money should we fund the Saudis whom we want to fight for us? I mean, the last time I checked they weren't going around with a tin cup."
38,Michèle Flournoy,"That's not what we're arguing, Dov."
39,Dov Zakheim,"So it's not the Saudis. It's not the Emirates. It's just these people themselves. Again, how did the Iraqi Army that we were training, and we poured billions into these guys, what a great job they did. So they weren't fighting for their homes, you say. Okay. What do you think would happen if we poured billions into the Sunnis in Iraq? Do you think the central government would let us? They won't even let us pour money into Kurdistan. So you really think they're going to let us pour money into the Sunnis? And one other thing, you're making the assumption, and you've said it, the Sunnis are appalled. I don't know that the Sunnis are appalled. I know that English‐speaking Cambridge and Oxford educated Sunnis are appalled. Absolutely right. I will not quarrel with you, but how many people are funding these guys? This is just like the Canadian IRA ‐‐"
40,Philip Zelikow,Frankly you get to a tangle. It's just so hard. They're so mixed up. Let's just leave them be and it'll be okay.
41,Dov Zakheim,We're not saying leave them be. And even if we we're still not saying leave them be.
42,Philip Zelikow,"When this region disintegrates you don't think we will be called back in? Do you think the day after a thousand Americans are killed in a mass casualty attack that the president ‐‐ you're going to go to the president of the United States and just tell him doing more about it is too hard? I went through 9/11. I saw what happened after 9/11. , saying Afghanistan was the least accessible place on earth for U.S. forces, but man, it was not too hard after 9/11."
43,Dov Zakheim,Wait a minute.
44,Michèle Flournoy,We're not asking for the Saudi military to come in and fight in Iraq and Syria.
45,Michèle Flournoy,"We're asking for the support to the Sunnis who live in Iraq, who want to be self‐governing and to be included in the Iraqi society. Look at the number of Sunni groups on the ground who are fighting ISIS now in Syria without adequate support. No one's talking about bringing in the Saudi Arabian military or the UAE. We're talking about helping the people who live on the ground in Iraq and Syria to reclaim their own lives and communities and—"
46,Philip Zelikow,Should we just let them go?
47,Dov Zakheim,"No, but ‐‐"
48,Philip Zelikow,"Fifty percent of the Saudis now sympathize with ISIS. That's the product of the status quo and we should therefore say gee, this really is too hard. I guess Saudi Arabia is going to go down the tubes, too? Where do you stop this?"
49,Philip Zelikow,Dov Zakheim was talking about ‐‐
50,Philip Zelikow,So ‐‐
51,Dov Zakheim,You're letting me talk.
52,Dov Zakheim,The ‐‐
53,Dov Zakheim,Thank you.
54,Dov Zakheim,"Thank you very much, Mr. Moderator."
55,Dov Zakheim,I happened ‐‐
56,Dov Zakheim,"‐‐ to be in the Pentagon when they were picking up body parts in 9/11. So, I don't need to be lectured about 9/11. Look. Do you honestly think that even if we got rid of ISIS, we would get rid of a 9/11? There was no ISIS in 9/11. And Al‐Qaeda is still there. And there are all these franchise terrorist groups ‐‐ some of whom call themselves ""ISIS,"" some of whom don't, who could ‐‐ who are just as intent on going after us. That is not the issue. To throw up the bugaboo of some individual bomber going after us, and therefore, we somehow defeat ISIS ‐‐ it just doesn't work."
57,Michèle Flournoy,But this is where I ‐‐
58,Michèle Flournoy,‐‐ I am bothered by ‐‐
59,Michèle Flournoy,I'm sorry.
60,Michèle Flournoy,"You know, you're right in the sense that there will always be violent extremists of one sort or another. What we need to focus on is trying to address the conditions that make whole communities vulnerable to being with them. And there, we have an approach that has not been tried and has not been fully resourced to do that in Iraq. And I think that's a much harder problem in Syria. But there are things that we have not tried that can also do that in Syria. And so, I think getting wrapped around the axle about how much military intervention are we talking about is a very important question. But the fundamental issue is what can and should we do to address those fundamental conditions, because if we don't address them, this threat will reach out and touch America."
61,Philip Zelikow,Did your Syria ‐‐ did your strategy to intervene aggressively ‐‐
62,Philip Zelikow,‐‐ to end the Syrian civil war require lots of U.S. troops on the ground?
63,Philip Zelikow,"So, you ought to just come on over here now."
64,Michèle Flournoy,"I think the ‐‐ you know, the reason why ‐‐ one of the reasons why containment works, vis‐a‐vis a superpower in a state like the Soviet Union, was because it was coupled with a robust policy of deterrence and the threat of massive retaliation. These concepts are not operative when you're dealing with ISIS. What are we going to do to deter ‐‐ I mean, ISIS ‐‐ deterrence of the Cold War sort does not operate when ‐‐"
65,Michèle Flournoy,‐‐ you're dealing with a transnational terrorist organization.
66,Philip Zelikow,What's an example of what's worked with a terror organization?
67,Philip Zelikow,"You know, it's interesting ‐‐"
68,Philip Zelikow,"‐‐ when someone said today that, ""Maybe we didn't need to worry so much about a catastrophic threat,"" it turned out that the recently retired head of the British Secret Service was at the table. And he said, ""When I was listening to you say that, I was thinking that neither I nor any leader of any security service I know of would have understood what you are talking about."" If the ‐‐ the threat picture that they are seeing, the threat picture that caused the director of the FBI to publicly say two weeks ago that ISIS is now the leading threat on his agenda, the reason the FBI has been picking up ISIS supporters in all 50 states of the United States during the last month ‐‐ that's because of the threat picture that they are seeing. And that's this year. That's not 2016. That's 2017. You just think about the way this develops in time, because this is a much larger safe haven than Al‐Qaeda ever had."
69,Michèle Flournoy,I think the –
70,Michèle Flournoy,"This is about both. I think we have to make the case that ISIS is a threat that will directly, touch ‐‐ threaten Americans, whether we want that to be true or not, and that the kind of political strategy, the kind of coalition, the kind of effort that is going to be needed to actually turn the president's and the vice president's words into actions ‐‐ which has not fully happened yet ‐‐ that will require U.S. leadership. And nobody else but the United States can lead that coalition to beat this organization."
71,Philip Zelikow,"The presumption that Israel is relaxed about ISIS ‐‐ ‐‐ which would ‐‐ you know, any member of ISIS if he were to encounter an Israeli citizen in ISIS territory, there's going to be a really gruesome video the next week, okay? So the notion that‐‐put yourself in Israel's position. They have a lot of things going on in their world right now. Palestinians. They're attacking Hezbollah in Syria, which is also fighting on Assad's side. So, the notion that gee, let's see if we can attack and bomb ISIS so that Jewish airplanes are bombing ISIS and that helps us recruit Sunni Muslims? So I think the Israeli's have kind of figured out that that's not the path to a successful coalition strategy to defeat ISIS."
72,Dov Zakheim,"Well, as I said, I don't think ‐‐"
73,Dov Zakheim,"‐‐ I don’t think that right now we have the national will to do this and frankly even if we started spending the money and, you know, we do spend money on these sorts of things, this takes time. In effect what you're doing when you ‐‐ if we were to do what you suggest, we would be containing them. We wouldn't be rolling them back at that point. They wouldn't lose an inch of territory because of that. It takes time. If you want to undermine them this is one of the ways to do it. What you're talking about is radio‐free Europe, voice of America updated to 2015."
74,Michèle Flournoy,"The administration, the Obama administration, has very successfully put together a 60‐nation coalition, but what we haven't yet achieved is a coherent strategy where everybody's pulling in the right direction, the same direction. One of the things that our partners need to be convinced of is the degree of U.S. commitment. I think if the U.S. shows that commitment we have a lot of leverage to get others to be using the money they're already putting in to this theater in a much more productive and effective manner. So, we're not going to be funding this alone. We have 60 nations signed up to help. What we have to do is use our commitment to better leverage and focus ‐‐ to better focus the efforts of the whole coalition, and we have not done that."
75,Dov Zakheim,"With respect, you earlier said we don’t want to rely on the Saudis. We want to rely on the locals."
76,Michèle Flournoy,"No, I said I don't want to have Saudi forces coming into Iraq and Syria."
77,Dov Zakheim,"Okay. Well, our ‐‐"
78,Michèle Flournoy,That's different than asking the Saudis to help fund a proper strategy that we have helped to put together.
79,Dov Zakheim,But part of our ‐‐ is our coalition only for funding? Is that what we're doing here?
80,Michèle Flournoy,"No. Of course not. There are other things as well, but do you think ‐‐"
81,Dov Zakheim,"Well, what are those other things?"
82,Michèle Flournoy,‐‐ it's a smart idea to put Saudi forces in Iraq and Syria? I don't.
83,Dov Zakheim,I'm not the one suggesting it. You're the one suggesting it.
84,Michèle Flournoy,No I didn't suggest it. You put words in my mouth.
85,Dov Zakheim,All I'm saying is you said that it's the local forces and now you've got a 60‐nation ‐‐
86,Michèle Flournoy,Local Syrian and Iraqi forces fighting ‐‐
87,Dov Zakheim,"Right, and now you're talking about a coalition that's doing what?"
88,Dov Zakheim,I answered the question.
89,Michèle Flournoy,"I think the question was in the face of still vibrant ISIS in Iraq and Syria, you can't ‐‐ how can you get to the political progress that will ultimately resolve these situations? You argued for diplomacy and political settlement on both sides of this border as part of your strategy as well, but you can't get there as long as ISIS is a vibrant force."
90,Michèle Flournoy,"We believe that we do and we've explained it, but I think absent that, you are condemning this region to perpetual instability, civil war, violence, and the launching ‐‐ the incubation of terrorism against the West. And against us."
91,Philip Zelikow,"One of the things I had the sad task of doing years ago was to be the Executive Director of the 9/11 commission. This is the commission that was called upon to investigate after the fact what had happened. And of course, for years before 9/11, we knew Al‐Qaeda was at war with us. Well, we weren't sure they were going to come to the homeland. And besides, if you looked at the problem ‐‐ and people did ‐‐ it was just so hard. Look at who we'd have to work with in Afghanistan ‐‐ the Northern Alliance. The politics of the Northern Alliance were nightmarish. There were thugs and warlords among them. And besides, if you wanted to do something with some special forces, there'd be risks to Americans. And of course then came 9/11. And then here I am interviewing generals, and national security advisers, and even former presidents. And it's ""Wish we coulda, wish we shoulda."" All the things that ‐‐ all the options they thought of doing, they considered, and they were too costly, too risky. And the politics of Afghanistan was too hard. But was it really then better now to then have to occupy Afghanistan and we're still there 14‐and‐a‐half years later, because we didn't take the risks, the messy politics, the hard laboring with some effort? Instead, we ended up with catastrophe and a catastrophic commitment of the United States. If you want to avoid that kind of catastrophic commitment, vote for the resolution, because we need to nip this in the bud. We need to deal with this infection now before the gangrene spreads and the surgeon brings out the hacksaw."
92,Michèle Flournoy,"One of the most searing memories of my time in the Pentagon was a visit to Dover Air Force Base. Dover Air Force Base is where the remains of fallen U.S. servicemen in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever ‐‐ are brought back to the United States. It is the first place where the families of the fallen are able to receive their loved ones. On the night I was there, my first visit, it was bitterly cold. We were waiting on the tarmac for what seemed like forever, for a large military transport plane to come in. Eventually, the plane came in, landed, and taxied to a stop on the tarmac. Off to the side, nearby, away from the press, was about ‐‐ were about a dozen grieving, grief‐stricken families who were there to receive a father, a husband, a brother, a daughter, a sister. And we waited for what seemed like an eternity. And eventually, the back of the plane opened to reveal a row of flag‐draped caskets. And one by one, each of those was lovingly carried by a group of soldiers off to an awaiting family. It was a just unbearable and devastating scene. This was the cost ‐‐ the human cost of war. This was Americans who had sacrificed everything for their country and families who would never again be the same. When we think about how we're going to fight or how we deal with ISIS, we need to think about Dover, the human cost of the choices we make and the choices we fail to make. And I am here today firmly believing that if we do not adopt a more‐robust and well‐resourced strategy, where we're not doing it all by ourselves, but we are leading an international coalition to fight this horrific movement, we will spend more blood and treasure down the road."
93,Dov Zakheim,"In 2002, I was asked to help get troops and funds for that coalition ‐‐ first the coalition in Afghanistan, then the coalition in Iraq. I got money. I didn't get any troops from Muslims. Not one Muslim country sent troops in, as I recall. Some helped with training in their own countries. To talk of coalitions is to talk, essentially ‐‐ if the Brits want to play again ‐‐ of a U.S.‐U.K, coalition with a lot of other flags. It's not going to work. General Petraeus is right. The surge worked. Phil, you’re right. With over 100,000 troops. And I remember sitting next to the Deputy Secretary of Defense and testifying, who then said that General Shinseki was wrong when he said we needed several hundred thousand troops to win in Iraq. We did put six figures of troops in Iraq. Lots of troops in Afghanistan. But that's behind us. It's not 9/11 anymore. It's not 9/12. We have a history of being in there. They don't want us. So, we have this Hobbesian choice: put in loads of troops, beat ISIS back ‐‐ roll them back, as you would like ‐‐ and take the risk of alienating the Arabs. Or alternately, holding them in place, doing all the other things you talk about. But it'll take time. It'll take money. It'll take will. And it ain't going to happen overnight. And I go back to what I said earlier. You have made the best arguments for containment ‐‐ with the exception of my partner, of course ‐‐ that I've heard tonight. We cannot beat these people unless we are absolutely committed to more money, more troops, more will. It ain't going to happen. Thank you."
