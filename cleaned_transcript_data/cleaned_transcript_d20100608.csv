0,Mike McConnell,"Well, a few things, not too many.",
1,Mike McConnell,"Well, actually I am going to share a little bit of a story that --",1
2,Mike McConnell,-- goes with that long history.,1
3,Mike McConnell,The translation --,1
4,Mike McConnell,"Thank you. The translation of experience is age. The bad news is age. The good news is grandchildren. But let me humanize just a second. A little under the weather. Two grandsons come to see me. The oldest runs into the room and says, ""Grandpa, Grandpa, make a sound like a frog."" And I said, ""Son, what for?"" He said, ""We're talking to Grandma and she said as soon as you croak, she's taking us all to Disney Land.""",1
5,Mike McConnell,"That's what age does for you. Let me compliment Marc on his argument. And I want to say up front, I agree with everything Marc said about the essence of what makes us Americans: privacy and civil liberties. However, I disagree and urge you to vote against this proposition because of how he framed it. Let me just quote, “Our argument is do not let a single authority, the National Security Agency,” agency I was chosen to lead, “control the Internet.” It has nothing to do - it has nothing to do with this debate.",1
6,Mike McConnell,"And I would summarize by saying we have laws and the key is getting the law correct. If the law is written appropriately and there is the appropriate oversight committee, if you violate the law, you will be held accountable. In a nation as free and as wonderful as ours is, leading the world in human rights and privacy and civil liberties, it's getting the debate framed right to mitigate the risk, to protect the nation consistent with our values and our laws. I urge you to vote against this resolution.",1
7,Bruce Schneier,"Actually, I think it's an East Coast crypto thing.",1
8,Bruce Schneier,"So, we're here today to debate the motion that the threat of cyber war is grossly exaggerated. And I also, in preparing, read a book full of articles and have some choice quotes. Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of this year that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we're losing. So, cyber war is going on right now in our country. Amit Yoran, who did cyber policy, cyber security under Bush, I believe, said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years, but it's happened so slowly that we don't see it. So, 9/11, you know, thousands of people dead, billions of dollars of damage, has happened, and we just didn't notice it like the cyber war we're currently losing. In 2007, Germany -- and it's a great -- this is a great newspaper headline -- ""Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war."" This is actually great because when Germany attacks China, they are attacking them by yelling at them because China started a cyber war. Another headline, same incident: ""China declares war on western search sites."" You can actually declare cyber war on search engines. I don't know if you knew that. An article from an Australian magazine, The Independent, February of this year: ""Hackers declare cyber war on Australia."" So, cyber war is so easy, even kids can do it.",1
9,Bruce Schneier,"This year, London Times, March of this year: ""Cyber war declared as China hunts for the West's intelligence secrets."" And last year -- actually, Fourth of July last year there was a cyber war in the United States, headlines all over the place. I have one from the",1
10,Bruce Schneier,"Okay, so this is silly, right? I mean, when we talk about cyber war in the headlines, in the rhetoric, we're not talking about war. This is a rhetorical war, right? It's the war on drugs, it's the war on poverty. It's a really neat way of phrasing it to get people's attention, right, and to make an interesting headline. Now, what's going on really is a blurring of the threats. There are a lot of threats out there. Cyber war is one, cyber crime; we’ve heard about cyber terrorism, cyber-hooliganism, cyber activism. And it often can be really hard to figure out what’s happening. And just think about how we respond to these sorts of threats. When something happens to us, it can be the response from the FBI or from the military or from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on who’s attacking us and why. And when we don’t know who’s attacking us and why, it can be very easy to call it war. But in most cases, it’s not, right? There’s a lot -- and -- I took quick notes, I probably got them wrong, some of McConnell’s statements, some of the quotes about, that we need to address the vulnerabilities, that the threats in cyber security have risen dramatically. Again, we’re hearing -- yes these are true, there are threats, there are vulnerab cyber security’s a big deal, but they’re not war threats. Probably in the debate later, we’re going to go into some of the examples of cyber war. I just mentioned Korea attacking the U.S. A big one was in Estonia; it’s been called the first cyber war. And basically, someone or some country, some believe it’s Russia, announced a denial of service attack against a bunch of Estonia websites, so it’s kind of like the army marches into your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you can’t get your driver’s license renewed. That’s sort of what that looks like. The only person they’ve ever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn who was annoyed about a statue falling down. So I mean, we’re now where we can’t tell foreign invaders from bored kids. The other events we talk about, China was mentioned a little bit. I mean yes, there’s a huge intelligence threat. China’s doing a lot of targeting against Google, against others. Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per day against government networks. That number actually is pretty reasonable for all of your computers as well. We’re talking about different worms and viruses; lots of threats, again not cyber war. So, I urge you to really think critically about what we’re talking about. Metaphors matter. If we frame this discussion as a war discussion, then what you do when there’s a threat of war is you call in the military and you get military solutions. You get lockdown you get an enemy that needs to be subdued. If you think about these threats in terms of crime, you get police solutions. And as we have this debate, not just on stage, but in the country, the way we frame it, the way we talk about it; the way the headlines read, determine what sort of solutions we want, make us feel better. And so the threat of cyber war is being grossly exaggerated and I think it’s being done for a reason. This is a power grab by government. What Mike McConnell didn’t mention is that grossly exaggerating a threat of cyber war is incredibly profitable. The last article I saw said there’s about $400 million in Booz Allen contracts on cyber war. You don’t get those by saying you know, this is kind of dumb. But, it really is. The threats are real; the threats are serious; cyber space is not a safe place, but these are not war threats. For the threat of cyber war to be serious means you believe the threat of war is serious. And if you’re not worried about war,",1
11,Bruce Schneier,--you can’t be more worried about cyber war; that just doesn’t make sense. I guess I’ll be back when it’s discussion time.,1
12,Jonathan Zittrain,I thought it was that they taught gym.,1
13,Jonathan Zittrain,Well.,1
14,Jonathan Zittrain,Thank you.,1
15,Jonathan Zittrain,"Thank you so much. Thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation, Intelligence Squared, and thank you Bruce for promising not to hack the voting devices that we're using tonight in the program.",1
16,Jonathan Zittrain,"So, here's where we're at so far. Marc says, ""Vote for us if you don't want a police state."" Bruce says, ""Vote for us if you think journalists and their headline writers and sometimes their sources exaggerate,"" and, ""Vote for us if you don't want a military state."" So, I stand here proudly before you in the negative, despite the fact that I do not want a police state. I do think that journalists and their headline writers sometimes exaggerate -- is it okay to say that in the Newseum? Is that all right?",1
17,Jonathan Zittrain,"Did you see, by the way, if you're particularly a fan of the news, you can live here. There are Newseum residences, which is --",1
18,Jonathan Zittrain,"There's like a bat pole and you can go down and read the headlines. I can't believe I've just used a minute in this opening, but -- and we all agree that the use of the word ""cyber"" is probably a bridge too far. If you at least agree with that, please send me --",1
19,Jonathan Zittrain,"Yes. You can applaud or send me some cyber mail, and I will send you a reply. What we heard from Mike were some scenarios that were kind of the watershed event scenarios, and I don't know about you, but after his rip on the banking system, I might be going to my nearest ATM and purchasing a brand-new hollow mattress.",1
20,Jonathan Zittrain,"I want to give a more gradual view of the vulnerabilities that you'll notice both Bruce and Marc handily acknowledge. ""Oh, we're not saying the system works. In fact, we agree it's utterly vulnerable. We just don't like the use of the word 'war,' and we don't like the use of the word ‘war' because it might give people a platform through which to have bad things happen after that, to militarize or to create a police state or something like that."" Well, fine. We have to argue against that, but let us be truth-tellers about the state of vulnerability in our networks and our endpoints, and then deal with it from there, neither exaggerating nor understating it. So, what kind of threat am I talking about? Let me just give you two quick examples. The network itself. The Internet is an utterly bizarre network, and to answer your question, John, the more I study it, the more I am just agog that it functions at all. And there are plenty of Internet engineers who --",1
21,Jonathan Zittrain,"-- remain puzzled and say, well, it's just a pilot project. The jury's still out.",1
22,Jonathan Zittrain,"So, for example, to get a piece of data from one end to another, like this pen up to the back of the room, the sane, rational way to do it would be to hire somebody, to have a Newseum employee who would take it up there, and then if it didn't get there, we would know whom to blame. Call it the FedEx method of getting it there. The way the Internet does it is basically like a big bucket brigade. I pass it to the front row, it goes back, would you mind, would you mind, or for sports fans, kind of like beer at a Red Sox game, right?",1
23,Jonathan Zittrain,"You gain nothing except soiled trousers by doing it, but there is a strong normative presumption that you will pass the beer.",1
24,Jonathan Zittrain,"Now, this also leads to structural vulnerability, because if you drink the beer or if you pass it forward instead of sideways, it doesn't get to where it's going. And it turns out that in 2008, the state of Pakistan, as is its wont, asked its Internet service providers to prevent people in Pakistan from getting the YouTube. There was something there that they didn't like. And one ISP, as kind of a parlor trick, chose to implement that block by announcing within the stands of fans that are ISPs here, that it, in fact, was YouTube. And this is a decentralized system. So, its announcement meant that packets that would otherwise be going to YouTube went to them from their subscribers. And then it resonated like ripples in a pond from one ISP to another like dominoes until with about two minutes, anywhere in the world, if you were trying to get to YouTube, your packets were going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back. Now, that is not only downright weird, it is an example of just a whole genus of vulnerabilities that are extremely difficult to fix. Now, was that an act of war? Definitely not. Is it a vulnerability such that if you had malice towards a state that relies asymmetrically on this network and decided that you wanted to use this as an instrument of your aggression, could you do so? Absolutely, and I do not believe you will hear them say otherwise. That's why you hear Bruce saying against the straw people of ""there's a cyber war already in progress."" All right, I don't think there's a cyber war going on right now against us in America, but boy are the vulnerabilities there. So long as there is the vulnerability, all we need is the motivation, and I don't want to rest on the good graces of any state around the world, or for that matter any 12-year-old, that wants to try to take down the net. And, he's not 12, but I did ask Ed Felten, computer scientist at Princeton, once, I said, ""You know, if you're in a 24- like scenario and your life depended on it, and you had to bring down huge swathes of the net and you only had a week to do it, kind of planting the seeds in the head I said could you do it. And he thought about it really careful, and he said, could I have two weeks? And that’s the kind of thing that did not make me feel better. Now, Robert Rosencranz, one of our hosts, mentioned GhostNet, our collaborators in the Open Net initiative at Toronto and up at Harvard, worked to expose this network that they named GhostNet where basically this wasn’t run of the mill Trojans that all of us have right now on our machines while we think we’re playing solitaire and in fact our machines are spamming each other. This isn’t a run of the mill Trojan; these are the ones targeted to particular people and institutions that a government might have interest in, compromising the machines and leaving them open on average for over 200 days, where they’ve got the keys to the kingdom. They can surveil everythi they can control the machine. How do we know? Because our researchers hacked that system and then could see what they saw. We saw the ministries of foreign affairs of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Brunei, open to us, if all we wanted to do was grab the files. The embassies of Germany, Romania, Cyprus, the Associated Press, not the embassy, the Associated Press itself, and NATO headquarters, exposed through our view of this system. That’s something that says to me, to the extent that surveillance and spy craft is an instrument of war, war is what you have. So I am concerned as, is I think everybody here about protecting civil liberties, about not having the responses to this problem be too quick, too panicked, too corporate, or too military. There are solutions that I hope we can talk about in the panel, to avoid too far in any of those directions. But let us be clear about the problem. Thank you.",1
25,Bruce Schneier,"I guess for cyber war, you need war.",2
26,Bruce Schneier,"So tanks would be nice. Maybe some bombs. It’s -- one of the rhetoric we hear is a cyber Pearl Harbor, which is an opening salvo to cyber war. I’m thinking of a fleet; that would work.",2
27,Bruce Schneier,"Right, what I would need to see for cyber war; I guess I would need nation hostilities that are warlike. I mean, I would have to be fearful of war. I would have to be fearful that Canada would roll over into the United States. Now if I was worried Canada would do that, I would worry about Canada’s cyber command and cyber capabilities, and I would worry about the cyber threats from Canada. As long as I feel safe against war, I just don’t think the subset of war is going to bother me. So you’re talking about damage we can hardly recover from. A lot of that happens by accident. We saw -- it was a couple years ago, three undersea cables were cut going into Egypt. Now, this was kind of a weird coincidence maybe, or maybe it was some kind of intelligence action. But that's a pretty big threat. You can imagine that as a war-type threat. And it was something that was recoverable from. The power blackout in 2003 hit I think D.C., the northeast part of the United States, southeast part of Canada. You know, that was a series of events. One of them seems to have been the Blaster Worm. I mean, the guy who wrote the worm couldn't have predicted on a bet that that would have resulted in that.",2
28,Bruce Schneier,"But cyber action. But again, it's a war.",2
29,Mike McConnell,"Thank you very much, John. When Bruce spoke at the beginning, he said, ""Mike McConnell said the U.S. is fighting a cyber war today, and we are losing."" That’s not in fact exactly what I said. What I said is if we were in a cyber war, we would lose. And I was making that statement somewhat metaphorically. And let's think about the terms we're using: cyber war, Cold War. Did we have a Cold War? For those of you in the audience about my age, you probably really experienced that. The issue is there was a Cold War. We had a nation state who, if the United Nations banged on the podium and said, ""We will bury you,"" there were risks, and we prepared. When we prepared, we prevailed. We won the Cold War. And if I had to do it over again, maybe I would use the word conflict or battle as opposed to war. So I want to highlight we're talking about the threat. There are vulnerabilities. They cannot be denied. Every member of this panel in this debate would agree that there are huge vulnerabilities. So what my partner and I are attempting to be are truth sayers, as he said, provide the warning to cause our citizens to recognize the vulnerability and cause their government, their businesses and their personal behavior collectively to address these vulnerabilities so that if there's a war we would prevail. One last thing, John. Desert Storm shocked the Chinese, shocked them. They had an army that was totally unprepared. In Desert Storm, one weapon destroyed target. Any time in history with thousands of weapons, from Desert Storm till today, the Chinese are building an army and a capability to take out the cyber capabilities of the United States, take out the eyes and ears, our strategic advantage. That's what is currently going on in this capture of information, moving terabytes of data.",2
30,Jonathan Zittrain,"Well, a little bit, there is a little bit of philosophical thing going on here where it's like is this a chair? You know, like, well, it has three legs and not four. And I never saw somebody sit on it, but you could. And I mean, you know, the boundaries of a chair gets fuzzy. So what makes a war a war? Well, we've heard a couple things. Who are the actors involved? If the person initiating the hurling of a stone at someone is a state actor, could it be a war? Well, if the stone hit somebody from another state, if a South Korean soldier in the demilitarized zone hurls a stone at his North Korean counterpart, squarely trying to hit him, is that an act of war? Is that an act of war,",2
31,Jonathan Zittrain,I think it might be too.,2
32,Jonathan Zittrain,"Let's just say that we should not try that experiment right now. You know? Worse has happened on that peninsula, and it started from lesser things. And then you look, all right, what's the motive and what's the effect? Now, what I hear is, yes, the canonical, platonic form of war is like the digital representation -- this is for a younger generation. In the “Lord of the Rings” series, when all those monsters are going up against each other, all right, that's a war.",2
33,Jonathan Zittrain,"Right? That's a Platonic form. But you can take away a leg or two and still have the fundamental truth be, one, are we exposed? Absolutely. And what are we exposed to? It may not be a bomb coming down our middle chimney of our house, but it could be something that greatly affects our way of life. If you indulge Mike's hypothetical and say what if tomorrow those two banks could be taken out, and suddenly everybody that had some claim to those $7 trillion has no idea to whom it belongs, nor can they prove it. Seems to me that's a predicate with the right actors in place to be an act of war.",2
34,Jonathan Zittrain,Yeah.,2
35,Jonathan Zittrain,Yes.,2
36,Bruce Schneier,"So this is actually interesting. As security guys, we tend to think all about the bad stuff. But, I mean, you go out in the audience, your bank account's actually fine, all right? Your identity hasn't been stolen tonight. We talk a lot about the threats. And in my business, we have conferences on the threats. You write papers on the threats. All we do is threats. But actually most of the world works pretty well pretty much all the time. The internet works. The pens go to the back of the room, the beer gets passed, and life goes on. Yes, there are vulnerabilities, but the networks, right, I mean sure -- yes, there's espionage going on. A lot of companies keep a lot of secrets? So, yeah, it's easy to sleep at night because we are safe. By and large, we are safe. Yes, there are threats. There are common threats. I mean, you could look at the number of -- amount of money stolen from identity theft, right, some cyber crime. And it's a big number. But it's a much bigger number, money that isn't stolen. Yes, there's bad stuff going on, but it's rare. It's in the noise.",2
37,Jonathan Zittrain,"No, we are not safe.",2
38,Jonathan Zittrain,"I wanted to put to Bruce the question I said I put to Ed. Bruce, if you had a crack team, NSA left you a team of good spooks, and you have two weeks --",2
39,Jonathan Zittrain,"-- not signing them up just yet. You have two weeks, and you have to wreak maximum havoc among the devices in consumer land. The people you just told should feel safe in their homes and businesses. You have to wreak maximum havoc. I know it's against interests to answer it. But tell me just how far could you go?",2
40,Bruce Schneier,"So, we talk about this. And actually, after -- in crypto conferences, security conferences, people get beers at the end of the night. And we have these conversations. And --",2
41,Bruce Schneier,"-- I mean, there's a side that --",2
42,Jonathan Zittrain,This is just among us here.,2
43,Bruce Schneier,"Right. There's a side that says, well, you know, new introduction of a Microsoft operating system is indistinguishable from a big denial of service attack.",2
44,Bruce Schneier,"So, you know, you've got these sorts of things happening --",2
45,Bruce Schneier,"We have these things happening sort of normally. We had an AT&T satellite go out because of software updates, and a lot of people's pagers didn't work. These sorts of things do happen. You can do damage but we recover. We're actually really good at recovering. And I don't think given two weeks and a crack team, you could take down the internet. You could make people real annoyed. You can make -- actually probably get paid overtime -- but the techies who have to fix their computers and networks are going to have a bunch of sleepless nights, but it's not going to take down the -- it's not going to do irreparable damage to our country, to our society. This is not an existential threat. I mean, nothing like that; this is around the edges.",2
46,Mike McConnell,"I want to go back to the word, ""war,"" and just remind the audience, Cold War, there were no Russians marching down Pennsylvania Avenue until we won.",2
47,Mike McConnell,"And they were on the friendly side. So this -- careful of the use of the word ""war."" Marc said that's a nation state attacking another nation state, we did not exchange nuclear weapons with the Soviets. We prevailed in that war. It's the metaphor of war. Now, also, Marc, earlier in our introduction, accused me of tapping his telephone, and he also just made reference to me stacking the audience with family and friends.",2
48,Mike McConnell,"Now, I would love to have done that however it is against the law -- it is against the law to tap Marc's telephone --",2
49,Mike McConnell,"-- unless he is guilty of a crime, and that goes completely out of the context of the National Security Agency and becomes a law enforcement issue which is controlled by a judiciary process.",2
50,Mike McConnell,"No, I do not. I do not. But let me just add a little more context, there are now 40, 40 -- four zero -- bills, resolutions, or amendments on the Hill circulating, and let me remind you of what Mark Twain said about that. No man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session.",2
51,Mike McConnell,"This is a debate that involves you in this room, the citizens, being informed about this process, the scare tactics of the government tapping your telephon that cannot happen with the right law.",2
52,Mike McConnell,It cannot happen without the right -- without the law.,2
53,Mike McConnell,Is it appropriate to be interrupted --,2
54,Mike McConnell,"Notice that Marc came for a different debate. Now, let me answer your question. You don't want to concentrate that kind of power with a bill on the Hill that is not thought out. My argument is this is very, very complex. My opposition here made reference to my comments about Cold War and nuclear weapons. The reason I made that reference is we didn't know what to do with nuclear weapons. We didn't know how to control them. We didn't know what our doctrine would be and so on. So in the late '40s, early '50s, we had the best minds in this country -- it was called the Solarium Project -- two things came out of that work, containment and nuclear deterrence. And what it said was never ever use them. It built the framework which allowed us to prevail in the Cold War. And that's the argument I'm making here. It's not about warrantless surveillance, easy to say, hard to refute.",2
55,Bruce Schneier,"I think it would be silly of anyone to think that any future war will not include a cyberspace theater, all right? War encompasses all theaters: land, water and air space, cyberspace. War will fill the available space.",2
56,Jonathan Zittrain,This side agrees.,2
57,Bruce Schneier,"So yes, so if there is war, there will be a cyber component. Georgia’s interesting. So Georgia was an actual tanks rolling in invasion and there were some website deface -- non-service attacks. We don’t actually know who did that. You know a lot of what we’re talking about, we talk about cyber wars, are kids playing politics. And you see it. You see Israel and Palestine, you saw U.S. and China, you know, when the U.S. spy plane had to land in China a bunch of years ago. I saw India-Pakistan when the sort of nuclear tests were going on. I mean, you see this all the time that it’s cyber-activism, it’s kids playing politics and we actually don’t know. It’s sort of odd to think that as you’re rolling in tanks you’re going to make it so people can’t visit some website. They’re probably not paying attention to that right now. But if you’re someone who’s rooting for your side, that’s what you can do. So, yeah, it’s hard to know what these things were but any future war will certainly include a cyber component.",2
58,Jonathan Zittrain,"Well, we actually saw in the recent Russia-Georgia conflict a number of Georgian blocks on the web. We infer that it might be the Georgian government actually trying to keep some of its own people from getting some of the bad news too early but certainly a component of that war was a cyber strategy. And we’ve seen it in other instances, whether it’s disputed elections or other things actually attacking cyber infrastructure because information is really key and if people are confused and they don’t know what’s going on and they’re relying on the Internet, they tossed their television set or they don’t know how to work it, that’s a problem.",2
59,Bruce Schneier,"Right. I mean, Iran’s an example of that, the elections in Iran. A lot of the information came out in cyberspace. Iranian government’s trying to block it and, you know, activists around the world trying to counter that. I mean, lots of great stuff. Not exactly war, but they were good things.",2
60,Mike McConnell,"John, could I add some--",2
61,Mike McConnell,"Let me add just a couple of facts about the Russian conflict. That cyber -- those cyber attacks were deliberate. I agree with the way that Bruce is describing it. There was a lot of piling on. But what happened was deliberate, it was rehearsed ahead of time and it was effective in shutting down the Georgian government and the Georgian government was defeated. The Russians achieved their objective and that’s an example of how you would interface in a current conventional conflict the ability to attack the other side’s capability to communicate, to coordinate, to integrate their forces. The Georgians lost.",2
62,Mike McConnell,Let's start with the fact that DARPA invented the internet. So that's a good start place.,2
63,Mike McConnell,There are two organizations that --,2
64,Mike McConnell,"True, because it was designed to be open and unassailable. However, it is what it is. There are two organizations that make encryption code for the federal government. One is the National Security Agency to protect secrets, and the other is the national institute of standards and technology for unclassified protection. There is an initiative calls CNCI, comprehensive national cyber security initiative, and it does exactly what you just said it didn't do. It is to direct funding into the national science foundation, produce a cyber corps, now it's a word, cyber corps. What does that mean? It means teaching kids double E and computer science and understanding so they can make this process better. If you're old enough to remember Sputnik -- 1957, most of you probably don't remember that. Immediately after, we had a bill that started sending kids to school for double E and computer science. I went to college on that bill. Otherwise I would have been not able to go. So this debate is about doing what you just said. It's not about accusing NSA of spying and warrantless surveillance or saying DOD doesn't do its job. It's about a debate that causes us to invest the resources and train our people so that we can securely rely on something we have become dependent on.",2
65,Bruce Schneier,The threat of him saying terrifying has been totally exaggerated.,2
66,Jonathan Zittrain,Can I just say -- can I just say --,2
67,Mike McConnell,It's posted on the White House website if you'd like to read it.,2
68,Jonathan Zittrain,"On behalf of the negative team for this debate, I whole-heartedly support much more money to universities and research.",2
69,Jonathan Zittrain,Let there be no doubt --,2
70,Jonathan Zittrain,-- our proposal for a new Maginot Line in cyberspace is moving ahead.,2
71,Bruce Schneier,You'll never get him a microphone.,2
72,Bruce Schneier,Do it the internet way.,2
73,Bruce Schneier,Yay. Nobody drink the beer.,2
74,Jonathan Zittrain,I guess that's for one of us.,2
75,Jonathan Zittrain,"I'll take a crack at it first, I suppose. First, note that our brethren in the affirmative set the bar at, does this create an existential threat to the country. That bar is too high, otherwise what happened in Grenada I dare say was not a war, although I think Grenada may have thought otherwis or Panama, or you name other conflicts that need not have existential dimensions. As I understand it, even the war of 1812, yeah, they burned down the White House, but, you know, they didn't actually threaten the entire integrity of our country. So we want to go short of existential threat. When I think of a war, what I think of is a hostile act designed to harm quite often, and typically physically, but not always, the interests, livelihood and, you know, day to day existence of the target. And that is most certainly possible in cyberspace. And when you see it happening because a 12-year-old can do it, it's like, yes, but it's not the Chinese. It's like, well, that does not make me sleep any better at night.",2
76,Jonathan Zittrain,The NSA.,2
77,Bruce Schneier,The voices in your head have a friends and family plan.,2
78,Bruce Schneier,You said “debaters” right. I counted four.,2
79,Mike McConnell,"The nation typically responds to one of four things. Fortunately, the most important is ballots. And even Marc would agree there's no tampering with those. The second thing is crisis. There is a crisis, we react, sometimes in a dramatic way. The third thing is money. And the fourth thing is law. What I am arguing, or what I propose is we get the law correct. We don't want to wait for crisis. And when I made reference earlier to the debate in the late '40s and the early '50s, it was achieved in a way that I would agree with Marc, openness. It was an open debate where we put the issues on the table, and we talked about it. And we got to the right place with the right strategy. That's when I'm advocating we recognize the vulnerability at a significant level where they would be attacked in war that could cause strategic damage to this country so that we elevate it and get the right policy embedded in law.",2
80,Jonathan Zittrain,"First, let me express complete support and agreement for the fragrant smoke that Marc just blew about openness and transparency. I'm completely in favor of that, too, so if you feel supportive of that, it doesn't mean you have to vote for that side because it's about the remedy, not about the problem. But you asked a great question about the remedy and let me give you a couple thoughts on that, that I think dovetail with openness and transparency. First, yes to Chris' question from the front row; more money to universities and research arms that brought us the Internet to begin with -- that's where the Darpa money went, would be great, and more concretely -- I don't know if anybody remembers SETI at home? This was one of these screensavers you could run instead of the flying toasters back in the day, and it would be crunching numbers from radio telescopes like that movie ""Contact,"" and at some point your computer might be, like, OMG, ""We have found extraterrestrial life.""",2
81,Jonathan Zittrain,"Many people installed that and you ended up being able to do what otherwise would take a super computer by people volunteering cycles of their computer, offered over the network, aid among people with a common goal wanting to serve humanity. And I would love to see essentially what you might call ""NATO at home,"" which is a form of mutual aid in alerting, so if your computer is having issues there's a way it can alert nearby other computers that can learn to drive around that pothole it just hit. I'm part of a program called Herdict, as in, verdict of the herd. I know the name is terrible, open to other ideas, but the basic plan is as you're surfing the Net and you find you cannot get there from here for whatever reason, you're trying to get somewhere and it's not working, you can click a button and just report that, not even to the government, to likeminded people who can then get for the first time exactly the kind of dashboard that Mike called for in his editorial so we know where the blocks are. These are concrete ideas in the spirit of mutual aid, and you don't have to --",2
82,Bruce Schneier,"So I actually disagree that openness is not a remedy. Openness is a remedy. I mean, one of the problems we have in Internet security is secrecy, that when you have secret systems, you don't know what the vulnerabilities are, you can't assess them, you can't make intelligent buying decisions and use decisions about what to choose. Openness actually is a remedy. And it is a way to improve security. The best security protocols we have in the Internet have been designed openly either by NIS, by the government, in open process, by industry through the IETF, another open process. Protocols that are developed in secret systems in secret tend not to work well. So basically I view security failures on the Internet as market failures that the incentives aren't aligned for whoever has the ability to secure to do it. And you can see that in identity theft, you can see that in viruses, that the people who can solve a problem don't have the incentive to do it. And when you have those problems and you have market failures, government has to step in and sort of set those right. So I actually agree with Mike that the problem is government needs to get the policy right. We probably violently disagree on what that would look like, but that's what I want to see. I want to see the market fails that prevent these problems, whether they're the worms, the viruses, and all the servers attacks, the Chinese hacking, from happening. I want to see those fixed.",2
83,Bruce Schneier,That'll be edited out of the broadcast.,2
84,Mike McConnell,Forty-two.,2
85,Mike McConnell,"I’m not making fun of your question. There are lots of numbers, millions of attacks and so on. Let me put it in a little context. I did focus on the financial community because that’s one I understand a little bit better. The financial community in the United States spends 500 billion dollars a year on IT, 500 billion dollars a year on information technology support. Now that’s moving all those ones and zeroes that represent your money or other company’s money and so on. So when you talk about expensive solutions, at least when I talk to the banking community, they are hungry for a set of solutions that allows them to have higher confidence in their transactions. Now let me make my point. Banking is based on confidence. We can’t run the globe without it. So when Marc made reference earlier to my suggestion at re-engineering the Internet, I’m all for the wild, wild web as most -- as much as anyone wants to be on it but I’m arguing for when the transactions impact billions of dollars and millions of peoples -- millions of people, you probably should have a level of communicating that is robust and secure. Example: the military sends its secrets over the same physical infrastructure as those of you in this room that text.",2
86,Mike McConnell,"Well, it’s a hard question to answer. There are literally billions of attacks. I can give you some numbers like that. Bruce could give you better numbers than I can, but the point is we were in a Cold War and we never exchanged nuclear weapons. We prevailed.",2
87,Mike McConnell,"The answer is there are many ways to answer the question with countless examples. Terabytes of data have been taken by foreign nation states out of this country that include intellectual property for businesses, it includes information from the Department of Defense, Department of State, the Congress, the aerospace engineering system, weapons designers, huge amounts of --",2
88,Bruce Schneier,So no debate that the threat of cyber espionage is real and cyber espionage happens every day. The question is about war. You asked about the losses due to cyber crime. Unfortunately I didn’t bring my cyber crime data and they’ve forbidden us to use the Internet up here so I can’t get it.,2
89,Bruce Schneier,"There are lots of numbers on the net and cyber crime is a very fast growing industry. I would argue if we were up here doing that the threat of cyber crime, we tend to under- exaggerate. We know that the federal government spends about $6 billion to $7 billion a year, unclassified, on cyber security. Classified you’d probably want to double that. That’s what most people believe but we don’t actually know and they won’t tell us because after that they’ll have to kill us.",2
90,Bruce Schneier,"Lieutenant General Alexander when he was testifying for head of cyber command said the Pentagon networks are targeted by hundreds of thousands of probes per day, whatever that means. You do the numbers, you divide up the number of computers that they have, that’s about the same number of probes that you and your corporate network are targeted by. These are mostly automatic worms -- there are ways you can make these numbers really sound big. Amount of data in cyber espionage? Sure, it’s a lot. A lot of times we don’t know. A lot of this stuff goes unreported --",2
91,Jonathan Zittrain,"Right where Bruce left off, the reason it’s hard to come up with numbers is because even the definition of attack varies. If somebody scans your port, have you been attacked? A computer port not a real life port.",2
92,Mike McConnell,You don’t even know who it is necessarily.,2
93,Jonathan Zittrain,"Exactly, you don’t. But let me give two statistics that I think are pretty well agreed upon that to me frame it nicely. One is that at this point, there is good confidence that over 99 percent of the e-mail sent in the world today is spam. Only one percent or less -- if you dipped into a trough of e- mail circulating, would actually be a letter to somebody with a human on the other end. That is pretty crazy. And network engineers generally say yes. But three minutes of Paris Hilton on a video is so much more bandwidth than all that email, who cares? Just throw it out on the other end. But it says something about just how far it's been penetrated. Statistic number two, at times, a particular Trojan or virus, a particular piece of malware crafted by one entity has been responsible by having infected lots of machines that then become spammers for over 50 percent of the spam on a given day. And that shows just the extent to which you could have a state change, where one particular well-crafted Trojan could have such an impact on the environment. And that gets back to the question about the threat. I measure the threat by the delta, the difference between the day-to-day world we experience right now in cyberspace and the potential, the plausible potential, not fake, but the plausible potential for a huge change in the way we experience it.",2
94,Mike McConnell,"It is not cyber war the way you are describing it. But the proposition is threat of cyber war. So we're talking about the potential threat of cyber war. And what I'm alleging is when there is conflict, even of a kinetic nature between nation states, cyber will be a part of a warfare that would be carried out. What my real worry is are terrorists groups that are not deterred, someone who is engaged in the equivalent of suicide bombing, given that they could access, penetrate and cause damage to the United States through cyber means. So take us back to the proposition. It's not war is happening. It's the threat of cyber war being in our future that we must mitigate.",2
95,Mike McConnell,"Bruce made the statement that the problem is secrecy, to which Marc agreed. And that's a very interesting point, but it has nothing to do with this debate. This debate is not about self-serving interests. It's not about large government programs. It's not about privacy and civil liberties. This debate is about recognizing the significant vulnerabilities resulting from our cyber interconnectedness which results in interdependence. The vulnerability is our interdependence. When the framers wrote the Constitution, we were pretty self-sufficient. Most of us were farmers, probably in excess of 80, 85 percent. Today in this country, 1 percent of the population is engaged in farming. The 1 percent feed the other 99 percent. There is huge vulnerability in the fact that you are dependent on electric power, digital money, a supermarket full of groceries. All of those things are interdependent and interconnected. And that's what we're talking about, those vulnerabilities. So if there is a war, if there is a war, cyber attack would be mounted. Now, based on the positions I've occupied inside and outside of government, I can assure you that nation states are preparing for cyber war. Marc said they may be preparing, but they would be unwilling to use it. You could describe that as deterrence. I support deterrence. That's what this debate is all about. What is it we have to do to be able to deter other nation states from engaging in war or engaging in cyber war? I urge you to support our position on this debate and vote against -- against the proposition.",3
96,Jonathan Zittrain,"Marc, let me thank you for your kind and genuine offer of asylum over on your side of the room.",3
97,Jonathan Zittrain,"Let me tell you why I think instead, both of you guys should be coming over here where the air is clear, and the thinking is equally clear --",3
98,Jonathan Zittrain,"-- and where your fears can still be realized over here. You don't have to give up what you're afraid of to come over to this side because I was surprised, too, because what surprised me tonight was that if there's going to be scare mongering on some side you would think it would be on the people saying no, no, the threat isn't exaggerated, here's why you need to be afraid, be very afraid. But the fear machine I felt was generated over here because what they were talking about were the worries about the remedy, if we come in and take something that they think isn't all that broke and try to fix it we're going to end up with surveillance we don't want, with a police state, with a military state, et cetera, et cetera. Now, in some respects I share that fear of overreaction should we get a watershed event, and that's why I think we need to be so gimlet-eyed about plausible possibilities that make things different than they are right now. I know the chicken wakes up every day, the free-range chicken, and says, oh, the farmer has come along to feed me again. Life is good.",3
99,Jonathan Zittrain,But sometimes induction doesn't work just from the fact that the farmer's been friendly every day.,3
100,Jonathan Zittrain,"So I worry that we'll get an event of some kind and then Bruce and Marc's nightmares will come true because we will end up in a Cold War mentality, a conventional war mentality, about how to deal with it, and that is the wrong mentality, and that's why I stand by my previous writings, Marc, and that's why when you asked for concrete suggestions they're suggestions that rely on openness, on transparency, on goodwill and cooperation among people metaphorically passing the microphone from one to another like an ad hoc mesh network. Creatively we can do this.",3
101,Jonathan Zittrain,And I thank you all.,3
102,Bruce Schneier,"So we spent a lot of time on semantics here. I'm going to again read this from the Washington Post, Mike McConnell said, ""The United States is fighting a cyber war today and we are losing."" This is a position that exaggerates the threat. It's a valuable one, $300 million in contracts of Booz Allen this year, and --",3
103,Bruce Schneier,"-- it's one we see again and again. This is not a few things, cyber war, cyber 9/11, cyber Pearl Harbor, cyber Katrina, cyber Armageddon -- every one of these words gets to be the millions or 100,000s of hits on Google. This is not just a few headline writers making a big deal. I mean, yes, the word ""war"" has flipped. We don't want to use it when we're actually at war, and we use it all the time when we're at rhetorical war. And this might seem like a petty semantic argument, but actually this matters a lot. All right, words matter a lot. Words have power. Words frame debate. Words suggest solutions. And words cause policy to be implemented. We are not just discussing whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated, we are discussing how we are going to deal with Internet threats. This debate has ranged all around. We've heard about espionage. We've heard about terrorism. We've heard about crime. We've heard about kids playing politics, and it's all here on a panel on cyber war. So when you think about this I urge you to vote that the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated, it's been grossly exaggerated by government and industry intent on grabbing power and money.",3
104,Bruce Schneier,Can we be on those panels?,3
105,Bruce Schneier,If you have to stall I think Mike and I can switch sides for 10 minutes.,3
