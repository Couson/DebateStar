For The Motion
Nowhere in its history, text, or understanding does the Equal Protection Clause require states to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples.
Marriage laws are a state's sovereign right, and the traditional definition between one man and one woman, is constitutionally sound.
Traditional procreation and child-rearing strengthen society and thus serve as a compelling state interest for marriage restrictions.
A right to same-sex marriage would create an entirely new, special constitutional right.
Against The Motion
Same-sex marriage bans discriminate based on sex and sexual orientation, and thus violate the Equal Protection Clause.
States have no rational basis or government interest in refusing to recognize same-sex marriage. Such bans fail to meet the judicial scrutiny necessary to trump individuals' 14th Amendment protections.
Depriving same-sex couples of the legal and societal benefits of marriage—which cannot be recreated through alternative legal substitutes—unfairly burdens them and their children.
