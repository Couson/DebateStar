For The Motion
There are over a billion Muslims in the world, and the great majority of them are peaceful, moderate practitioners of mainstream Islam.
The Muslims who have succumbed to violence are motivated by politics, not religion.
The word “jihad” has different meanings. It can be translated to “holy war,” but its primary meaning is “struggle,” and in the Koran, this refers to the internal and external effort to be a good Muslim.
Against The Motion
No monotheistic religion is a religion of peace—they know lengthy periods of peace, but they also know lengthy periods of war. The militaristic history of Islam is well documented.
In 21st Century Islam, there are more occurrences of violence and war and subjection of women than there are in other religions.
The leaders of Islam, the heads of religion in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are the ones speaking for the religion, not Islam’s moderates.
