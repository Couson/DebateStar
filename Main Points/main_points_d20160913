For The Motion
Elites have pursued an agenda that has benefited corporations and the affluent, but largely ignored the plight of the working class.
With growing competition for jobs and manufacturing moving overseas, the pro-immigration and pro-trade elite are out of sync with America’s workers.
The establishment failed to recognize populism’s growing strength and essentially did too little, too late, to stem Trump’s popularity.
Against The Motion
The far right has been sowing the seeds of unrest and anger, paving the way for an outsider candidate who has appealed to voters’ frustration.
Globalization benefits the U.S. Retreating from the world through protectionist policies would hurt the average American more than it would help.
There is an abundance of easily accessible information out there, and we can blame the people who voted for Trump for accepting his campaign of misinformation.
