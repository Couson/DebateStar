For The Motion
The United States government should follow the lead of other nations and guarantee affordable, accessible health care as a basic human right.
A single-payer system would cut overhead costs by streamlining resources and make navigating the health care system easier for consumers.
A Medicare for All system would alleviate the burden of having to navigate multiple private insurance plans, allowing providers to spend more time treating patients and improving the quality of their care.
The current health care system has perverse incentives and a fee-for-service model. Private health insurance often still leaves patients with exorbitant bills.
Against The Motion
Individuals should have the freedom to choose how they manage their health, and only a free market will provide competitive optionsforhealth care consumers. Plus,according to recent polls, most workers are satisfied with their private, employer-sponsored coverage.
MedicareforAllis simply too expensive. Right now, the federal debt exceeds $22 trillion, and according to a range of economic assessments, Medicare for All promises to add trillions more.
Under a single-payer program, physicians would likelyreceive less compensation, which could disincentivize practitioners and discourage future health care professionals from joining the field.
If the bureaucratic mishandling of the Department of Veteran Affairs or United States Postal Service is any indication, the government should not be trusted with managing one of the largest sectors in the U.S. economy.
