For The Motion
The “us versus them” populism sweeping the Western world today is fueled by technological advancement: As low- and middle-skilled workers continue to lose jobs to automation, anger will manifest, leaving many concerned that democracy is no longer working in their favor.
The promise of high-paying jobs in the era of automation is a pipe dream. Many who lose their jobs won’t have access to the training needed for the sophisticated jobs of the future. This will further widen wealth inequality and exacerbate the divide between globalization’s winners and losers.
Anti-democratic leaders promising to bring back jobs from immigrants and robots will continue to get elected over status quo candidates, further eroding democratic institutions and empowering the rise of authoritarian societies.
Against The Motion
Automation won’t mean the end of work, just as the advent of steam power, electricity, and computers didn’t mean the end of work. Through regulation, taxation, and innovative solutions like UBI, society can adapt to new technologies and assuage populist discontents.
While automation will displace some workers, this won’t affect the total number of available jobs: As technology continues to advance, newer higher-paying jobs will evolve, employing more people and making the “us versus them” message less appealing.
Robots and other technological advances could save the global economy. As the global population ages and birth rates decline, automation can help reshape the future of work, filling demographic-driven job vacancies and staving off a labor shortage that could lead to democratic instability.
