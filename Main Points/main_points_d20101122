For The Motion
Continued investment in Afghanistan is economically misguided. After nearly a decade of combat, the U.S. has committed substantial financial and military resources to the war with few positive results: Afghanistan is increasingly violent and unstable.
Tribal divides threaten the agency of any singular governing body, and the Karzai administration has proven to be hopelessly corrupt and inept at creating a cohesive centralized government.
The threat of a Taliban insurgency pales in comparison to the global rise of al Qaeda. The United States should transition its efforts to combating terrorism around the world rather than investing its limited resources in the failed occupation of Afghanistan.
Against The Motion
If the military fails to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan, the region will again become a safe haven for terrorists and America’s defeat will embolden its enemies to engage in future aggression toward the United States and its interests.
While Hamid Karzai is a problematic leader, his administration has cooperated with Americans on key initiatives and has forgone mass violence in the name of political power, which marks progress from previous Afghan leadership.
Under General Petraeus’ leadership, the United States has begun a counter insurgency operation that promises to sway Afghan public opinion toward U.S. intervention and build effective governance structures in the country.
