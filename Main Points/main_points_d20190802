For The Motion
The prospect of China becoming an open and liberal state is now seemingly a fantasy, and recent U.S. policies are finally responding to the threat China poses to the West.
The U.S. is getting tough on China’s rampant intellectual-property theft and unfair trade practices through tariffs.And it’s working: China’s economic growth is at its lowest in decades.
China is developing advanced cyber weapons capable of cutting off U.S. access to strategic waters in the region. The U.S. mustrespond with strength to maintain its global power.
Against The Motion
The United States and China are great competitors – not enemies. It is a mistake to label China as such, particularly when the two countries have economies that are inextricably linked.
Current tariffs and trade policies are not productive: They are hurting American workers, slowing the global economy, and, some argue, benefiting China more than the United States.
In getting tough on China, the U.S. is dangerously increasing the risk of escalating tensions. And a miscalculation could lead to unwanted conflict.
