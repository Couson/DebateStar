For The Motion
The era of male dominance is coming to an end. Women are increasingly seeking political and social power in the workplace, in government, and in their own homes.
Women are taking higher education by storm. Today, female students are the majority on most university campuses.
The modern economy, which prizes communication and creativity, is better suited to traditionally female skills and will likely continue to benefit women, over men, in the future.
Against The Motion
Women are underpaid and underrepresented in the American workforce. Despite notable gains in the ability for women to seek and maintain careers, they are still a minority in the nation’s highest paid and most sought after jobs.
​From Capitol Hill to governorships to executive offices, men maintain the majority of economic and political power in the United States. Until women take the nation’s top seats of power, men are not finished.
Society will always rely on physical strength and brawn, traditionally associated with male workers, for critical occupations in fields like construction and the military. As long as those jobs remain in demand, men will be recruited and favored for jobs in the workforce.
