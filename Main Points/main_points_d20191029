For The Motion
We're in the midst of a DNA revolution: While personal genetic information is becoming more accessible, scientists are now able to isolate genes that relate to specific heath and behavioral tendencies. Society should embrace this new era of information and recognize the critical role our genetics play in our lives.
The multibillion dollar parenting industry profits by selling theidea that parents' behaviors, and purchases, will determine their children's success. Rather than accepting this undue economic and social pressure, parents should look to science and genetics instead of doling out money on how-to books and workshops.
Understanding a child’s propensity for academic achievement can lead to a more inclusive education system and better allocation of resources. Rather than forcing children to engage in subjects for which they have no natural aptitude, schools should embrace genetics in helping students succeed.
Acknowledgingthat genes have such a powerful influence on individuals may result in more sympathy for those who are prone to mental or physical challenges.
Against The Motion
While DNA is important, factors like familial dynamics, communities, culture, and dietdeeply impact human development and cannot be underestimated.
Humans are99.9 percent identicalin their genetic makeup. Yet, human cultures and values vary widely, indicating that upbringing, not genes, are crucial in influencing individuals.
Studies suggest that environmental factors, such as one’ssocioeconomic situation,is a more reliable predictor of academic achievement than genes.Further, limiting a child's schooling options based on their personal genetics is unfair and unjust in a democratic and free society.
As history indicates, suggestions of genetic determinism may lead to harmful social policies. Plus, if individuals believe that their fate is written in their DNA, this could lead to apathy and make conditions they are susceptible to worse.
