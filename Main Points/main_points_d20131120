For The Motion
We cannot identify terrorists in real time, and without bulk collection, there would be no way for our intelligence community to track and connect their movements.
Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Patriot Act, the NSA's actions are legal.
NSA surveillance has made us safer. In 2009, intelligence officials were able to connect an email from a known terrorist in Pakistan to Najbullah Zazi, thwarting Zazi's plans to bomb the New York Subway system.
Terrorists dispersed around the world make use of our communications infrastructure. If we don't allow government to use this data, what is the alternative?
Against The Motion
Whether the current government is trustworthy and acts with good intentions is irrelevant. Building the capacity to collect and store the communications of every American is a capability open for abuse.
The NSA has overstepped its authority by conducting suspicionless surveillance of Americans, violating our First and Fourth Amendment rights.
By demanding or creating back doors into encrypted systems, the NSA has weakened internet security for everyone.
The sheer volume of data collected is making the NSA dysfunctional, and the agency's purported successes have been exaggerated; instead of a previously reported 54 terrorist plots thwarted by phone surveillance, the real number is only 1.
