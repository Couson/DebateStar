For The Motion
Protesters are shouting down those they disagree with and demanding protection from views they find offensive.
Certain topics have been labeled off the table for discussion, leaving no room on campuses for diverse or unpopular ideas.
While some of the issues being protested are legitimate concerns, students have gone too far with their demands.
Against The Motion
Rather than closing down speech, the protests have spurred productive discussions about race and diversity on campuses.
The protests are not hypersensitive reactions to discrete events, but a response to long-simmering tensions and hostile environments.
By mobilizing for ideas they believe in, these students are not catastrophizingâ€”they are exercising their right to free speech.
