For The Motion
The sex industry, which includes clothing, strip clubs, and film, is well established; paying for sex is simply a continuation of an already entrenched social and economic practice.
Sex crimes often associated with prostitution, such as rape, human trafficking and underage sexual activity, should not be conflated with the legitimate sale of sex between consenting adults that possess the agency to make informed and meaningful decisions for themselves.
Just as individuals have the right to decide to use their bodies in laborious careers such as construction, they also have the right to employ their bodies for financial gain.
Prostitution is a historically prevalent practice and, if society accepted its role in social and economic life, could be better regulated to prevent abuse and exploitation.
Against The Motion
Prostitution offends the basic moral structure of a society and perpetuates a sexually exploitative culture in which traditional values are undermined for the sake of lust and commerce.
Because a legal market drives demand, the sale of sex accommodates illicit trafficking of underage girls, particularly in impoverished countries.
Prostitution perpetuates sex-inequality and violence against women as it coerces low-income women, who often are financially responsible for children or siblings, into sex against their will.
Research on the long-term effects of prostitution shows that women who engage in sex acts for money face long-term psychological consequences.
