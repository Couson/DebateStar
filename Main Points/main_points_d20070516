For The Motion
China’s rapidly developing military technology, including anti-missile defense systems, may compromise American security and interests.
A growing China will seek dominance in Asia, diminishing America's influence in the region.
Popular culture in China is largely nationalistic and anti-American, and that sentiment will likely spread as the country gains economic and political capital in international relations.
Against The Motion
China’s economic boom benefits everyone, including the U.S., as China grows as a trade partner and global consumer.
As China becomes more prominent and culturally exposed, its growing middle class will likely call for substantial government and social overhaul.
China does not have the political or economic infrastructure to deal with its unprecedented economic growth, and will likely face domestic upheaval that will stifle its ability to engage on the world stage.
