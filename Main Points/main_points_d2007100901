For The Motion
Our growing national debt is a national crisis. When economic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes. Under our current budget, by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90 cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually in America.
It was government intervention in the housing market under President Clinton that led to the housing bubble and financial crisis.
The 9 states without income taxes are growing faster and attracting more people than the 9 states with the highest income taxes.
The rich are already pay a disproportionately higher share of taxes, and these high taxes essentially tie the hands of those who are in a position to innovate and create jobs.
Against The Motion
Lowering tax rates is not going to force government to cut government spending. We want government to do a lot, but we don’t want to pay for it. 78% say entitlement costs are a major problem, but 56% say no to tax increases and 66% say no to benefit cuts.
The repeal and limiting of financial industry regulation played a huge role in causing the financial crisis.
When there are crises—as in the financial crisis, which was created by the private sector—it’s government that steps in to clean the mess. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, the government failed by not doing enough.
Government also has a role to play in technological innovation by supporting research and education. We have DARPA to thank for the internet, and the National Institute of Health to thank for many of our new drugs.
