For The Motion
Unless Hamas renounces its  charter,  which calls for violence against Israel, it remains a terrorist organization.
Giving Hamas political status legitimizes its history of violence as acts of state rather than acts of terror.
Recognized political parties cannot claim a militant wing independent of the state, as Hamas does.
Hamasâ€™ election reflects the corruption and failures of the Palestine Liberation Organization, not the widespread support of the Palestinian people.
Against The Motion
Hamas won political power through a free and fair democratic election, making it the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people.
Hamas provides critical social services and, like any governing body, has the right to defend its constituency from external threats.
Many renowned political leaders, including Nelson Mandela and Malcolm X, employed violence to achieve their goals; delegitimizing the governing agency of Hamas because of past violence is inconsistent with global practice and history.
Hamas is a national liberation movement that sought democratic political power, not a terrorist organization.
