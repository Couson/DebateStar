For The Motion
Google’s dominance in its market, including its attempts to muscle out Microsoft, Amazon and eBay, constitute an economic and social hazard given the company’s widespread control over public opinion and vital services.
Google threatens individual privacy as personal details such as one’s address, political donation history and phone number are readily available to anyone with Internet access.
To make a profit, Google acquiesced to the Chinese government’s censorship demands and continues to perpetuate that government’s distorted lens.
The inclusion of paid advertisements in Google searches represents a violation of public trust and allows the company to exert undue influence over public opinion in the interest of profit.
Against The Motion
Google brings information and empowerment to the masses in a way that was unimaginable before the company was founded.
The services Google provides connect intellectuals and researchers around the world and allow for unprecedented progress in critical fields such as science, technology, and medicine.
Despite notable concessions to the Chinese government, the existence of Google in China allows Chinese citizens to access otherwise unavailable information about foreign entities and creates expectations around transparency that challenge censorship.
Google has been a leader in developing the technologies that many rely on, including map services, connectivity tools, email, and others—all of which it has released to the public for free.
