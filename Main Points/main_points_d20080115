For The Motion
Innovation in sports, such as new technology and medically based training techniques, should be welcomed, not stifled.
Steroids are used in various medical treatments and other enhancers, such as alcohol and caffeine, are used in daily life without recourse; athletes shouldnâ€™t be subject to regulations not otherwise imposed on the general public.
Professional sports are inherently dangerous as competitive athletes push their bodies to the limit; steroid use is no different.
Prohibiting performance-enhancing drugs causes more harm to athletes, as it forces athletes to take drugs in secret and ensures that these drugs are not regulated.
Against The Motion
Performance-enhancing drugs give using athletes an unfair and unnatural advantage over their competitors.
If performance-enhancing drugs are not banned, athletes will be compelled to sacrifice their immediate and long-term health to remain competitive throughout their often short-lived careers.
If permitted by professional athletic leagues, young and aspiring athletes would be pressured to take drugs, therefore compromising their health and wellbeing.
Steroids and other drugs compromise the integrity of competitive sport as a whole; they eliminate the element of natural competition and tarnish the tradition of sport as a wholesome cultural pastime.
