For The Motion
Solar geoengineering is just a Band-Aid on top of a larger issue, and it will not address the underlying behaviors, practices, and products that lead to excessive greenhouse gas emissions.
There are too many possible unintended consequences associated with solar geoengineering, including changing weather patterns, cooling the planet too much, or further depleting the ozone layer.
Solar geoengineering technologies could fall into the wrong hands: Rogue actors or governments around the world could potentially wield them without the consent of affected communities or nations.
Against The Motion
Solar geoengineering imitates a natural process that already exists. Introducing reflective particles into the stratosphere could mimic the global cooling effect documented after volcanic eruptions, helping to decrease global temperatures.
Compared to the economic cost of managing global warming, including drought, ocean acidification, and increasingly turbulent tropical storms, solar geoengineering is a more affordable way to mitigate the effects of climate change.
It is too riskynotto test solar geoengineering. Recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest that as global temperatures continue to rise, the results will be catastrophic for humanity in the decades to come.
