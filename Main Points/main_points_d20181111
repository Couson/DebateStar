For The Motion
Rather than living up tothe innovation-inspired idealismthat SiliconValley was founded on, tech companies have put profit over people.Engineers design intrusive products intended to capture our attention and our private data.In some cases, people havebecomethe product, in a way that would have been impossible to predict andthat constitutes unique harm.
Silicon Valley promised a digital revolution that would empower and connect people around the world. Instead, tech companies have created platforms that disseminate hate speech, foster divisions, and threaten to undermine democratic institutions.
From diversity issues to sexual harassment to political bias, Silicon Valley’s culture has come under fire. Beyond creating toxic workplaces, these biases are manifesting in the algorithms and products tech companies produce and are negatively impacting people around the world.
Against The Motion
For the tech industry – like most industries before it –making money is a key goal. Because of the excitement around innovation and the outsized role major tech companies play in our everyday lives, these companies have been unfairly maligned for practices that are typical in a capitalist society.
Silicon Valley has revolutionized the way we work, sell, buy, and communicate with others. Innovative and disruptive tech pioneers are giving people around the world access to a global exchange of goods and ideas, often for free.
Silicon Valley is tackling some of today’s toughest social and political challenges head-on. Byempowering employees to speak out and disseminating tools to fight injustices around the world,the tech industry is evolving to bemore socially conscious than ever before.
