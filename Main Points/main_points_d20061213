For The Motion
Hollywood films portraying Americans as violent and morally deficient are used as anti-America propaganda abroad.
By vilifying corporate America in its films, Hollywood creates hostility toward American industry abroad.
Hollywood often condemns the American government and military as corrupt and immoral, giving license to global distrust of American leadership.
Against The Motion
Anti-Americanism is fueled by unpopular American policies and practices, not Hollywood movies.
While Hollywood films include themes of violence and immorality, these themes are common in entertainment around the world.
Hollywood serves as a global model for freedom of political and social expression, and thus fosters a positive image of American values abroad.
