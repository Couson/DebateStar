For The Motion
Unlike previous wars, the war on terror lacks a geographic framework and requires increased global surveillance to monitor enemy activity and ensure national security.
An individual right to privacy does not eclipse the collective right to national and public security.
The Fourth Amendment does not guarantee absolute freedom from government search, but rather requires those searches be justified.
The legal parameters around what justifies a government search must be expanded; by the time an individual is proven to be a terrorist, it is often too late for surveillance.
Against The Motion
Expanding government reach during an open-ended conflict ensures “wartime” powers have no established end date and leaves Americans vulnerable to government overreach in the name of security.
Targeted search is more effective than widespread surveillance that allows government to collect the data of innocent Americans.
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures and should not be violated or tempered.
The government should enhance foreign intelligence gathering and reduce barriers to interagency information sharing before seeking to undercut American freedoms.
