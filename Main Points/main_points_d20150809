For The Motion
We cannot keep ISIS at a distance and allow it to establish a sanctuary, as we did with al Qaeda in the 1990s.
The U.S. must intervene on a larger scale, which includes the deployment of more ground forces.
We are at war with ISIS and the administration's incrementalism will only give it space to grow stronger.
Against The Motion
Defeating ISIS would require the commitment of hundreds of thousands of troops, which the U.S. is not prepared to do.
After over a decade fighting in the Middle East, the U.S. still has a poor grasp of the regionâ€”even if we were committed to defeat ISIS militarily, what then?
By containing ISIS, we will allow its ideology and brutality to consume it from within.
