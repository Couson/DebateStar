For The Motion
When traditional techniques do not work, American interrogators must be granted additional means to prevent America’s enemies from waging war and killing innocents.
Harsh interrogation tactics have precedence in history and in modern warfare; America should not adhere to restrictive prisoner treatment standards when there is no reciprocity abroad.
America’s enemies are not entitled the protections afforded to its citizens.
Against The Motion
Torture of even the most dangerous prisoners undermines American values both at home and abroad.
Torture inevitably leads to faulty information and corrupt intelligence that compromises legitimate American efforts and puts troops in harm’s way.
American use of harsh interrogation techniques encourages its enemies to engage in similar, or more inhumane, tactics on American prisoners.
