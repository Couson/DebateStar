For The Motion
Intervention often results in unintended consequences. We only need to look at Iraq and Libya, both worse off than before, as proof that American intervention in the Middle East has failed.
We need to put the threats from the Middle East into perspective. IS does not represent a significant threat America's national security or "a new danger different from ones that have been around for some time."
We need to work with other countries where there are common interests. If our priority is stability, it is in America's interest to work with Iran.
Against The Motion
The Islamic State is a growing threat to the region and the world. American nationals and thousands of Europeans are believed to have joined IS—we must fight IS overseas and not wait for the fight to come to us.
Under President Obama we have empowered Iran and its proxies and pushed our traditional allies away—the result will be an America without partners in the Middle East.
There is no other great power to step into the void if we retreat.
America would be among the last suffer from a breakdown of world order, but by then it will be too late.
