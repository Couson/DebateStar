For The Motion
It is highly unlikely that any party would engage in a large-scale cyber attack on the United States unless they were also prepared to engage in the conventional warfare that would undoubtedly follow.
Nations are unlikely to attack a civilian computer infrastructure, even if it is vulnerable, because targeting civilians constitutes a war crime, and would likely lead to international retribution.
Though the threat of cyber war can be mitigated through diplomacy, international agreements, and improved national security technology, cyber war is used as propaganda to justify Washingtonâ€™s control over, and regulation, of the Internet.
Against The Motion
Cyber attack simulations have shown that America would be crippled by a cyber attack; not only is its critical infrastructure extremely vulnerable, but the government is also unprepared to respond to an attack.
Militaries must be prepared to address enemy offensives on all fronts, particularly given the devastating effects cyber attacks would have on individual nations and the global economy.
While non-state actors currently lack the capability to carry out massive cyber attacks, over time they will likely gain that capability and may be contracted by governments to attack hostile nations without formal declarations of war.
