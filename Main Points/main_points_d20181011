For The Motion
Rising stars on the progressive left like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are gaining momentum among those who feel left behind in the 21st-century economy. Their economic message could win over swing-state voters – including some Trump voters – for the Democrats.
As Americans adapt to a new economy, progressive populists argue that policies likeMedicare for all, free public college tuition, and a federal jobs programwill finally bridge the ever-widening inequality gap in our nation.
Following huge Democratic losses in 2016, progressives promise to shake-up the party by replacing establishment Democrats who, they argue, are out of touch with both their constituents and the values that have long fueled Democratic movements in the past.
Against The Motion
Rather than moving to the far left, centrists argue, the Democratic Party should promote experienced, center-left candidates who have the knowledge and political capital to win back working-class voters in the Midwest and beyond.
Policies like Medicare for all, free public college, and a federal jobs program come with an exorbitant price tag. Rather than promising sweeping overhauls, centrists say, Democrats should create real opportunities for Americans by promoting pragmatic – and viable – economic policies.
Progressive populists, though dominating the headlines, have not yet proven their electoral viability. Centrists argue that rather than spark a nation-wide progressive wave, some of these candidates will win in already-blue districts, oust experienced Democrats, and fracture the party further.
