For The Motion
Donald Trump’s democratic election reflects the will of the people. American democracy requires the peaceful transfer of power and the opportunity for elected officials to exercise the powers afforded to them by the Constitution and national law.
Obstructionism will not only prevent lawmakers from taking the actions necessary to operate the federal government, it will deepen America’s political divides.
Donald Trump’s campaign was fueled by a growing sense that Washington had failed the voters. Preventing President Trump from acting would further disillusion many Americans against their government.
Against The Motion
Donald Trump’s campaign trafficked in bigotry and racism. Allowing him to implement his campaign promises would put American ideals, like religious freedom and civil rights, at risk.
Since elected, Donald Trump has proven unqualified to serve in the office through his failures to disclose potential conflicts of interests, routine dismissal of American intelligence agencies and diplomatic traditions, and insistence on nominating highly controversial figures to key leadership positions.
Donald Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million. His Electoral College victory does not reflect the will of the American people and he has not earned a mandate to lead.
