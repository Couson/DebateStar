For The Motion
Since the Great Recession, the capital position of banks has largely improved. And with reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act, the United States now has ways to identify and hold accountable institutions, improving financial stability and consumer protection.
Outside of the U.S., countries have also taken steps to shore up their banking systems: The European Union’s Single Supervisory Mechanism gives the European Central Bank authority to monitor, test, and intervene in financial institutions.
While some may be alarmed about increasing debt, others see systemic ways to address it.The institutions that hold debt are more diversified than they were in 2008, and though the deficit in the U.S. is high, some say it doesn’t pose a problem to the global financial system.
Against The Motion
Some argue that the post-financial crisis reforms are heavy-handed and burdensome. And in the wake of another crisis, they say, it narrows the Federal Reserve System’s emergency lending authority and exposes the lending to a higher threshold of scrutiny.
Europe has not done enough to ward off another financial meltdown, and the Single Supervisory Mechanism will not be able to monitor thousands of banks. Further, inter-Europe geopolitical, social, and economic issues – like Italy’s debt crisis – could trigger another financial crisis.
Many economists say debt could pose a serious threat to the financial system: U.S. national debt is over $21 trillion, and there are piles of risky corporate debt – totaling $6.3 trillion – which could lead to defaults and another financial crisis.
