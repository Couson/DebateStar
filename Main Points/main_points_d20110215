For The Motion
The American people want alternatives, and what we've seen with the Tea Party and the election of an upstart like Barack Obama are grass roots, anti-systemic movements.
The two-party system has produced politicians who govern to the extremes of their political parties and there is a silent middle that is left with nowhere to go.
Both parties are beholden to large corporations and can no longer be trusted to serve the public interest.
Against The Motion
We've had choices outside the two-party system—libertarians, Ralph Nader, Ross Perot—but at the end of the day, people vote for the major party candidates.
Multi-party systems look good from the outside, and yes, governing coalitions can be made, but much of the time it's a prescription for a stalemate.
Conflict encourages the policing of power.
Americans like divided government. For 38 of the last 60 years, presidents have had to work with legislatures controlled by the opposing party.
