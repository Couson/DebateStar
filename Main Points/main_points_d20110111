For The Motion
Instead of reducing the deficit, the health care act will increase the deficit by $500 billion.
Insurance will become more expensive and health care costs will rise faster than they would have otherwise.
Millions could lose the insurance they already have and because of Medicare cuts, many seniors will lose access to care.
The mandate that all Americans obtain health insurance coverage is unconstitutional.
Against The Motion
The health care act will reduce the federal deficit by $143 billion over 10 years.
The bill will expand coverage to 32 million who are currently uninsured and insurers would not be allowed to deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, cancel policies without proving fraud, or put lifetime limits on benefits
Exchanges would allow people not covered by their employers to shop for insurance at competitive rates.
While not perfect, this is an important first step toward providing universal health care.
