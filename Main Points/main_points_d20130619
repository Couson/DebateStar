For The Motion
The cumulative effect of defense budget cuts will leave the U.S. military at risk by degrading its future capability. This at a time when Korea is testing nuclear missiles, Iran is rapidly developing its nuclear program, and China is aggressively increasing its military spending.
The U.S. spends a smaller percentage of its GDP (4-5%) on defense than it did during the Cold War (6-7%). Growth in federal spending on entitlements is a much greater threat to our economy.
The changing nature of conflicts requires us to be engaged on multiple fronts that require more resources for troops and recruitment.
America's military support for its allies in Asia and Europe creates stability throughout the world.
Against The Motion
America spends more on defense than the next 13 highest spending countries combined. Even with a smaller budget, we will remain the world's most powerful military force.
Cuts will make us safer by injecting more accountability, forcing the Pentagon to manage its spending more carefully.
The U.S., surrounded by two oceans and relatively weak neighbors, faces few national security threats.
We are allowing our wealthy allies to be free riders. It's time for them to step up and take on more of the costs of their own security.
