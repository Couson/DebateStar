For The Motion
In an era often deemed “post-truth,” reality has become distorted and headlines can range from the unusual to the absurd. For many comedians, it has become increasingly difficult to create smart, original comedy that parodies news already beyond the norm.
In the current polarized climate, many comics argue that their audiences are anxious and tense. And beyond that, some comedians – many of them women – have been targeted and threatened, eliciting fear that could stifle creative comedy.
Some argue that while Trump might inspire good comedy, the cost may be too high.The effects of persistent hurtful rhetoric and the marginalization of minority groups are issues too serious to laugh about, they say.
Against The Motion
Trump may be a polarizing figure to some, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t inspiring great political comedy. Comedians are working harder to create hard-hitting entertainment, and shows like “Saturday Night Live” are seeing their best ratings in decades.
Humor can be a powerful tool, one that can unite people in divisive times. And with many getting their news from late-night hosts like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, more people are brought into the fold and connected by comedy.
Comedians could influence America during this seemingly turbulent time. Whether it’s awakening people to injustices, rallying others to vote, or advocating for or against a policy, people might listen if it’s comically made.
