For The Motion
Because of its unconditional support, the United States is unable to speak openly and critically of Israel’s mistakes.
America cannot act as an honest intermediary of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, thus ensuring continued conflict in the region and providing fodder for terrorist groups that use Israel’s occupation as a recruitment tool.
America’s unwavering alliance with Israel has led Arab nations to question American intentions in the Middle East and has hindered opportunities for military, economic, and political collaboration between the United States and other nations in the region.
Against The Motion
If the United States wavers in its commitment to Israel, it will send a strong message that its alliances are unstable, undermining American hegemony and weakening its relationships abroad.
The American military benefits immensely from its relationship to Israel, particularly in terms of intelligence sharing on terrorism, joint military actions, and in Israel’s actions to prevent proliferation in Iraq and Syria.
Because the United States enjoys a special relationship with Israel, it is uniquely suited to broker a two-state solution given the Israeli incentive to negotiate with Palestinian leadership is to preserve its alliance with the United States.
