For The Motion
Our diverging priorities in the Middle East and the Saudi’s continued support and funding of religious extremism highlight the differences in our national security interests.
Advances in natural gas and oil production technologies have freed us from our reliance on Saudi oil.
The U.S. cannot continue to ignore Saudi Arabia’s abysmal human rights record on their treatment of women, religious minorities, and dissidents.
Against The Motion
This relationship has been mutually beneficial for over 70 years, and we cannot afford to alienate one of the few states holding an unstable region together.
Saudi Arabia has been an important ally in the fight against terrorism, especially through shared intelligence.
Saudi Arabia is the largest producer of crude oil in the world, and it is to the global economy’s benefit to secure its accessibility.
