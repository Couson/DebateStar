For The Motion
Despite its noble goals, affirmative action is a counterproductive, and arguably unconstitutional, social policy that depends on the very principle it stands against: racial discrimination.
Placing students in schools mismatched to their abilities has led to higher rates of minority failure and attrition.
This academic mismatch reinforces negative stigmas and racial stereotypes that have harmful social consequences, resulting in self-segregation on campuses and undermining racial equality in larger society.
Color-blind admissions, along with a class-based form of affirmative action, would better achieve the goals of social equality, with far fewer costs and more beneficial outcomes.
Against The Motion
Affirmative action is necessary to redress past racial injustices—and their ongoing effects—and to fight the present forms of discrimination that pervade society today.
The active integration of marginalized groups into mainstream academic institutions more fairly distributes opportunity, access and power.
In addition to benefiting individuals and minorities, affirmative action invaluably strengthens entire institutions through diversity, as testified by major corporations and the U.S. military.
Color-blind alternatives, while beneficial as a supplement to affirmative action, do not adequately or honestly address the persistent presence of racial inequality in the U.S. To eliminate racial preferences in higher education would have disastrous consequences on the whole of society.
