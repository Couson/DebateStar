For The Motion
Israel does not have the military capacity to prevent the bomb, only to delay it.
If Iran was ever on the fence, an attack would almost certainly push them in the direction of achieving nuclear weapons capability.
An Israeli attack will rally the Iranian public behind what is currently an unpopular regime, garner Iran international sympathy, and incite violence against Americans across the region.
Deterrence worksâ€”the U.S. successfully deterred the Soviet Union for more than 40 years.
Iran's leaders are not irrational and know that a nuclear attack on Israel would provoke a devastating response from Israel and the U.S.
A war to prevent an Iranian bomb would be a disaster for Israel and for America, which is still reeling from Iraq, Afghanistan, and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
Against The Motion
A nuclear Iran would provoke an arms race in the Middle East.
A nuclear weapon would increase Iran's influence in the Middle East and embolden allies like Hezbollah and Syria.
Iran would use the threat of a nuclear attack whenever it's threatened, triggering a crisis that could easily spiral out of control.
Iran's leadership is sincerely anti-Semitic and on numerous occasions has called for the destruction of Israel, and history has shown that we discount the ideas of extremists at our own peril.
