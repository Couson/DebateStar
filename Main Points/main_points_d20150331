For The Motion
Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to _declare war._ The president_s unilateral military action threatens perpetual war and violates the democratic separation of powers, transparency, and civic participation.
The President does not have authority under the 2001 AUMF to engage in hostilities against ISIS, which is neither al Qaeda nor an _associated force._
Currently, ISIS does not pose an imminent threat to the U.S. and therefore neither falls under the president_s Article II power to defend the U.S. as commander-in-chief nor the War Powers Resolution.
Against The Motion
Invested with the powers of commander-in-chief, the president has constitutional authority to engage in hostilities to protect national security.
The 2001 AUMF (and by some accounts the 2002 Iraq AUMF) authorizes the president to use U.S. military force against terrorist threats.
The Constitution must be interpreted alongside historical precedent. Formal declarations of war are few and far between in U.S. history, while executive action and legislative acquiescence to hostilities have created robust common law.
The 21st century has brought a rapidly changing context of global actors, situations, and strategies, which have fundamentally changed the way we go to war.
