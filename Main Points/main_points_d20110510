For The Motion

Consumers can save billions of dollars relying on clean energy sources and increasing energy efficiency, leaving more money to be spent on other goods and services.
Major investment in clean energy will lead to innovation and new technology.
Reducing dependence on imported energy frees us to spend our limited resources domestically and protects us from fluctuations in oil prices and climate change.
Against The Motion
The Department of Energy's own job creation estimates are far more modest than those of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
A significant portion of clean energy funding has gone to foreign companies who have the advantage of having been heavily subsidized by their own governments for a number of years.
Clean energy jobs face the same problems any other industry facesâ€”competition from cheap foreign labor.
