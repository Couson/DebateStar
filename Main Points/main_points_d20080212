For The Motion
No nation or international collective has effectively upheld international law; without American enforcement, the world would fall to chaos and violence.
America must safeguard its own interests and security by intervening in global conflict and working to construct strong governance where it does not currently exist.
America has a moral obligation to uphold the values of democracy and human rights around the world.
Against The Motion
America faces dire need at home, and should fix itself before looking abroad.
America does not have the resources or cultural knowledge to serve as global policeman, especially in areas that do not directly benefit American interests.
Regional autonomy and global leadership must be considered; America does not have the right to intervene anytime, anywhere.
