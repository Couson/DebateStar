For The Motion
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech.
In Citizens United, the Supreme Court correctly ruled that corporations and unions could fund political speech.
Independent spending by Super PACs means there is more information available and a better-informed public.
The more information disseminated to the public, the more politicians will be held accountable for their records Super PACs help challengers overcome the inherent advantages held by incumbents' campaigns.
Against The Motion
A small group of wealthy individuals and corporations are flooding political campaigns with unlimited amounts of money, distorting the system by drowning out the voices of average Americans.
Super PAC donor disclosure rules are easily bypassed. Anonymous contributions to 501(c)4 groups—nonprofit organizations that are not required to disclose donor names—can then be donated to like-minded Super PACs.
It is disingenuous to say that Super PACs are independent of the campaigns they support when they are often run by candidates' ex-staffers.
Super PACs are evolving into "full-blown shadow campaigns," able to do the dirty work for their preferred candidate's campaign, with no accountability on the part of the candidate.
