For The Motion
Conflict is inevitable as China challenges America as the dominant power in Asia, a role America is unlikely to cede any time soon.
Land reclamation in the South China Sea, cyber-attacks, and a growing military budget point to a more aggressive, less reactive China.
Despite its economic and military strength, China has not become a responsible global stakeholder, instead choosing to free-ride on the existing international order while pursuing its own interests.
Against The Motion
It is in the vital interests of both countries to work together and collaborate on shared interests like nuclear containment, climate change, and trade.
We should not automatically interpret China's behavior as aggression; their foreign policy has long been guided by the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention.
By treating China with hostility and working to isolate and diminish it, this predicted adversarial relationship will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
