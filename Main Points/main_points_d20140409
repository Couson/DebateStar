For The Motion
Their financial outlook is bleak: Millennials have entered adulthood during a time of recession while burdened with unprecedented levels of student loan debt.
Millennials have been raised to be narcissists, "characterized by overconfidence, entitlement, unbridled competitiveness, and lack of empathy."
Millennials' tech savviness is superficialâ€”they are no better or worse than at using technology than everyone else.
Against The Motion
Millennials are more optimistic, civic-minded and politically engaged.
They are the most educated generation in American history, and for those with a bachelor's or an advanced degree, it is paying off.
Millennials bring their tech savvy, adaptability and collaborative skills to the workplace.
