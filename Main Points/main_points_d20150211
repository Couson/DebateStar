For The Motion
America's military strength remains unrivaled.
The U.S. has recovered from the recession faster than any country besides Germany.
America is blessed with geographical advantages—it is insulated by two oceans, held together by a vast network of waterways, and boasts vast stretches of arable land.
America is, and will remain, a leader in scientific and technological innovation.
Against The Motion
Inequality is on the rise and America's middle class is struggling.
Partisan politics has paralyzed government and left Washington incapable of addressing critical issues.
America's credibility and moral authority has been badly damaged in our fight against terror—from our detention and interrogation programs to NSA spying and the invasion of Iraq.
Despite America's military dominance, the rise of insurgents and terrorism render its conventional forces less effective.
