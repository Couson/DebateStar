For The Motion
Economies with central banks that conducted aggressive quantitative easing immediately following the financial crisis are experiencing stronger growth than those slow to adopt it.
By buying assets from financial institutions, central banks encourage these institutions to lend more to businesses and individuals, which can in turn leads to more spending and investment.
As individuals and businesses borrow and spend more, more jobs are created and the economy grows.
Against The Motion
There has been very little evidence that quantitative easing has done what it promised to do, and what small gains we have seen have been on Wall St., not Main Street.
By distorting the prices of stocks and assets, quantitative easing creates bubbles that can lead to recession.
If money circulates too rapidly, it is difficult to keep inflation at bay.
Quantitative easing pumps money into financial markets, allowing governments to ignore the real solutionâ€”structural reform of unsound economies.
