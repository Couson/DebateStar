For The Motion

As champions of social justice, liberals seek to correct historic wrongs – including systemic inequality – through social and economic policies that level the playing field for the underprivileged and disadvantaged.
Liberals champion human rights and environmental protections around the world by building alliances across borders and prioritizing moral and humanitarian causes on the international stage.
Against The Motion
As defenders of religious liberties and family values, conservatives preserve American moral and social tradition.
Rather than creating a culture of government dependency, conservatives seek justice by rewarding hard work, entrepreneurialism, and self-determination.
By emphasizing patriotism, including reverence for those who serve to keep the nation safe, and recognizing America’s unique role as a global power, conservatives ensure order both at home and abroad.
