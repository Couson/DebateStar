For The Motion
Democratization in the Middle East should be the result of regional revolution and the legitimate political will of its people, not American intervention.
Overthrowing existing leaders in the name of democracy often leads to the installation of oppressive leaders who seize power when their nations are politically, socially and economically destabilized.
The act of promoting democracy in the Middle East, which often directly conflicts with the will of existing governments and political leaders, would inspire more terrorist attacks and further harm American interests.
Against The Motion
America cannot maintain its image as a beacon of democracy and freedom if it fails to support the democratic will of historically oppressed people.
Terrorist groups thrive in areas that perpetuate a sense of political hopelessness; building democracy diminishes those strongholds and restrains Americaâ€™s enemies abroad.
Fostering stability and democracy in the Middle East directly benefits American economic interests as it fosters the creation of global allies and reduces the need for foreign humanitarian aid.
