For The Motion
The line dividing what's legal and what's not is arbitrary. Alcohol, another mind-altering substance, is found to be a factor in 40% of violent crimes and 40% of traffic fatalities, yet it's still legal. Nicotine kills more people than alcohol and drugs combined, and it's also legal. We associate drugs with crime and violence but this stems from the fact that they are illegal.
Legalizing drugs takes away a vital source of funds from organized crime.
Drug users themselves are rarely violent and incarceration rates impact minority groups disproportionately.
The U.S. spends billions on its war on drugs every year, but cost-benefit analysis has shown that it has not been a success. Prohibition is what gives drugs their value.
Instead, government should regulate and tax their sale. We need to move toward a public health model. Portugal, which decriminalized drugs just over ten years ago, has found its drug abuse down by half.
Against The Motion
Legalizing drugs would mean decreasing prices and increasing consumption. In the Netherlands where there is non-enforcement for soft drugs, marijuana use doubled among 18-25 year olds.
Legalizing drugs won't stop the violence. Criminals won't stop being criminals, drug traffickers and dealers will just turn to other outlets to make money.
The war on drugs is working. Drug use has dropped substantially at 1/3 the rate of what it was in the late 1970s. Cocaine use is down by 40% and meth use down by half.
Even if we legalize drugs, there would be a black market anyway. Sales to children would obviously remain illegal, and regulated prices would be undercut.
Drugs are illegal because they are addictive and harmful. The public health problems impact society on many levels: individual, family and community.
