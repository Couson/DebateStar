For The Motion
Regardless of America’s ability to stem insurgency, Afghanistan’s tribal makeup, fraught with historical alliances and rivalries, inhibits the ability of a centralized body to govern the country’s arbitrary borders.
To ensure long-term political change in AfPak, the United States will need to commit extensive military and economic resources, which the American citizenry will not support.
Stabilizing Afghanistan is unlikely to substantially reduce the threat of Islamist groups as the terrorists will simply flee to Pakistan, which continues to harbor Taliban leadership, and other hospitable regions.
Against The Motion
If America withdraws troops and support, AfPak will destabilize and the Taliban will return to power, thus establishing a safe-haven for terrorists and increasing threats to American security, guaranteeing the need for future intervention.
Because stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan is a global security priority, the United States has international support and should capitalize on the investments of other nations to secure lasting peace in the region.
While corruption and weak leadership present real challenges, public opinion in Afghanistan and Pakistan has turned against al Qaeda and the Taliban, and the U.S. should work to support this momentum.
