For The Motion
America will continue to take the lead, but the time for unilateralism is over.
Mired in two wars, our armed forces are already stretched dangerously thin.
The financial crisis has been a humbling check on the American economic model, and puts us in the position of having to make hard choices and reign in expansive foreign policy.
With torture, rendition, two unpopular wars, Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, America has lost the moral high ground.
Against The Motion
The effects of America withdrawing would be calamitous as there is no other country willing and able to take on the burdens of leadership.
We have not devoted vast energy and treasure to overreaching around the world and, in fact, we need to increase defense spending to support our global responsibilities.
We should do more to promote political and economic freedom.
