For The Motion
Revenues from hunting fund conservation efforts, both within the U.S. and abroad, going toward wildlife refuge programs and preserving national, state, and private lands.
Regulated hunting helps maintain healthy animal populations, preventing overcrowding, resource depletion, and the spread of disease.
The sport of hunting promotes active engagement with nature and ensures humans are invested in preserving wildlife and lands.
Regulatory agencies and industries created around hunting are critical to combating poaching and illegal depletion of animal populations.
Against The Motion
Hunting alters the natural composition of animal herds and, even when population sizes are maintained, negatively impacts their long-term survival.
The global market around trophy hunting is often corrupt and funds raised from hunters are often misappropriated.
Domestic and international regulatory agencies that oversee hunters are often pressured to set quotas based on industry demands rather than animal well-being.
Endangered animals are already at risk of extinction by poachers and natural predators; legalized hunting exacerbates the problem.
