For The Motion
As advertisers moved online and to alternative platforms, the traditional media monopoly on advertising came to an end and made the mainstream media’s business model obsolete.
Americans should be exposed to a variety of new, independent voices and mainstream media’s extraordinary power to shape the national agenda should no longer go unchecked.
Mainstream media has failed in its responsibility to maintain objectivity and provide the facts and analysis Americans need to make decisions as a society.
In an attempt to improve ratings and readership and thus deepen profits, mainstream media organizations have focused on entertainment rather than substance and have forgone traditional journalistic values.
Against The Motion
Without long-standing media institutions like the New York Times, there would be few outlets with the resources and influence to protect against government overreach on First Amendment rights or advocate for the interests of journalists.
While independent media often provides analysis and diversity of ideas, it relies heavily on the original reporting done by mainstream organizations and often serves as aggregators of media rather than original content creators.
In-depth investigative journalism, critical to the maintenance of a free press and society, requires the substantial resources and expertise of mainstream organizations.
While mainstream media should adapt to meet the demands of a new consumer age, it also must ensure that reliable voices are the gatekeepers of credible information.
