For The Motion
In Iraq today, schools and universities are open, marketplaces are teeming, and people are engaging in social activities; this marks a dramatic change from the chaotic state of the country in 2006.
The nation has begun a political reconciliation with a growing number of citizens engaged in the political process and more than 500 parties formed.
Iraqi security forces are now fighting alongside the American army to combat enemy militias without the hindrance of sectarian infighting, which promises a future of Iraqi-led national security.
Against The Motion
Due to America’s poorly planned occupation, Iraq remains socially and politically unstable: its infrastructure is demolished, many former military personnel were abruptly unemployed, and the majority of the nation’s physicians are dead.
Iraq’s current political leadership constitutes an uneasy coalition of sectarian individuals with an extensive history of violence that has not been reconciled.
In committing vast resources to a now strife-ridden Iraq, the United States has weakened its own, and Iraq’s, ability to combat Iran’s nuclear development and rise to regional prominence.
