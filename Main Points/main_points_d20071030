For The Motion
Russia’s focus on modernizing its military capabilities, including building an intercontinental ballistic missile force and nuclear submarines, does not reflect a nation seeking peace with the West.
To deflect attention from their increasingly autocratic policies and practices, Russian leaders are stoking nationalistic sentiment against American values and customs.
The Russian government's lack of diligence in addressing incidents like Alexander Litvinenko's suspicious death represent an apathy toward diplomacy with the West.
Against The Motion
The ideological divide that consumed global affairs during the Cold War era is over; America can disagree with a nation’s internal politics without declaring that nation an enemy.
Russia’s growing push for influence in global affairs and demands of national sovereignty make Russia a challenge to some American interests, but not an enemy.
Russia and the United States have a shared interest in combating security issues, such as the rise of Islamic extremism, and it remains in both nations’ best interest to work together.
