For The Motion

The U.S. has led the world in refugee resettlement since World War II, and it can and should do more to respond to this growing humanitarian crisis.
The U.S. is admitting the most vulnerable refugees into the country, focusing on women, children, and survivors of violence.
Against The Motion
The U.S. cannot adequately screen refugees when there are no records to check against, and fraudulent documents are in wide circulation.
We can help more Syrian refugees, and help them more effectively, by providing aid to them in neighboring Middle Eastern countries.
We only need to look to Europe to see how welcoming massive numbers of refugees and migrants has created internal insecurity.
