For The Motion
From autopilot to apps, our lives have become increasingly automated. By depending on devices instead of actively engaging in work or leisure, our cognitive skills fade away.
The internet—as the central medium by which we read, write, and learn—has fundamentally changed the wiring of our brains, diminishing our ability to think deeply and critically.
Humans are not effective multitaskers, and digital media's constant distractions weaken our focus and scatter our attention.
Instead of broadening our intellectual and sociocultural horizons, social media narrows our worlds to echo chambers.
Tech giants know more about us than we know about ourselves. As they relate to us as mere consumers, as data, we lose our autonomy.
Against The Motion
The digital revolution has reinvented knowledge, replacing traditional constraints with open, limitless networks. With the internet, humans can work together to infinitely scale knowledge.
With our 24/7, hyperconnected networks, knowledge has been democratized, giving increasing agency to everyone, everywhere.
The efficient, seamless presence of digital technologies has freed us from menial tasks, thereby opening space in our heads for higher pursuits.
Technology is what we make it, not vice versa. Far from mindless, passive consumers, people across the world are actively engaging with technology to better their lives and societies.
