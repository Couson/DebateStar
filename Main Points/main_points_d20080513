For The Motion
Those in need of human organs cannot rely on altruism alone; there must also be a legal incentive to create the necessary supply.
A legal, regulated organ market would not only save lives, it would disincentivize individuals from turning to the often medically unsound and violent black market.
Compensation is legal for pregnancy surrogacy, egg donation and participation in medical trials; organ donation for profit would not constitute an unprecedented medical or social practice.
Though insurance companies now legally pay for the immediate costs associated with an organ donation, legalizing organ sales would help cover long-term medical costs for donors.
Against The Motion
Allowing individuals to contract the sale of their cadaveric organs would increase distrust and fear around organ donation, particularly as potential donors fear being declared dead prematurely.
Legalizing the sale of organs would increase the number of Americans that travel to developing nations in search of cheap human organs, motivating the poor to turn to organ harvesting for financial refuge.
If human organs become a commodity, donation rates will dwindle as potential donors see the exchange as a sale rather than an altruistic act.
The ability to purchase human organs, rather than wait on a donor list, would ensure only wealthy individuals have access to this life-saving treatment.
