For The Motion
Prosecutors control which cases to pursue, who will get charged, and what the sentence will be. These immense powers give prosecutors leverage to undermine the right to trial by jury, pressuring defendants into pleading guilty. Over 90% of both federal and state court cases are resolved through plea bargaining, not through jury trials.
The exercise of these very same powers, in the absence of transparency, also causes unequal justice.
Prosecutors may impair the fact-finding process by withholding evidence and through their control of witnesses.
Against The Motion
Prosecutors must have all the tools available to them to prosecute crimes of great complexity, to hold the powerful accountable, and to keep communities and our nation safe.
There are already checks in place to balance prosecutorial powerâ€”judges, defense lawyers, and the law enforcement agencies prosecutors must work with.
Pleas are voluntary, and often achieve the cooperation that leads to stopping the chief wrongdoers.
