For The Motion
A press that can publish state secrets without fear of prosecution endangers the nation.
Groups like WikiLeaks should not be able to, in the name of transparency, indiscriminately dump thousands of state secrets onto the Internet.
The press can be a flawed judge of what is in the public interest. It is no better at separating itself from its own interests than anybody else is, and unlike the organs of government, which are accountable to the public and each other, the press is accountable to no one.
Against The Motion
There are secrets that should be kept, but it should not be up to the executive of the U.S. government alone to decide which of those secrets are worthy of keeping.
"State secrets" encompasses far too much. You cannot have a system in which you keep state secrets from being published if almost everything is a state secret.
Secrets are not merely published because they are interesting stories. They are published because there's a worthy debate that the public should conduct.
