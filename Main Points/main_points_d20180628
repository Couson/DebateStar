For The Motion
From manufacturing to retail, increasing globalization over the past few decades has eroded the power of unions and driven down wages for American workers.
Globalization has lowered the price of certain goods, but this does not make up for decades of job loss among the U.S. working class due to corporate greed, offshoring, and outsourcing.
Trade agreements may benefit multinational corporations and the people who head them, but the American working class is often adversely affected: job loss becomes more common as trade deficits grow.
Against The Motion
Globalization has ushered in an era of unprecedented wealth, lifting millions of people around the world out of poverty. Although some jobs have been lost along the way, the benefits largely outweigh the costs.
Globalization has significantly driven down the price of goods in stores like Walmart, K-Mart, and Target, making life easier and more affordable for the U.S. working class.
Trade agreements like Nafta encourage investment and lead to substantial economic growth, benefiting the U.S. economy on the whole and enabling social and economic mobility.
