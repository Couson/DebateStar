For The Motion
Pollution is global. As EPA regulations stifle American industry, businesses operating in nations without such restrictions gain a competitive edge and offset any potential environmental benefit created by American emission controls.
The economic burden of complying with EPA demands is passed from American companies to consumers and disproportionally affects the poor who cannot afford higher energy costs.
EPA emission regulations force the closure of existing power plants and pressure businesses to adopt new, untested, and often unreliable technology, which compromises U.S. energy security.
While the U.S. may seek to be a leader in climate change regulations, bringing proposals to the international table that are highly unpopular and contested at home undermines American credibility abroad.
Under the Clean Power Plan, states must file plans to reduce carbon emissions or accept a federal plan, which violates state sovereignty protected by the 10th Amendment.
Against The Motion
The effects of climate change cannot be mitigated by one nation alone. The U.S. must take a leadership role to combat this threat, which will require setting a global standard at home.
To avoid overreach, the Clean Power Plan sets state emission reduction standards based on the economic impact of regulation in each state, and offers each state autonomy in how it will address compliance.
In 2009, the EPA formally found that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare; it has a clear mandate to enforce regulations that will counter this threat, regardless of opposing political or industry interests.
EPA performance standards target the sources of pollution, which is a regulation of industry not states, and is both constitutionally sound and aligned with standard federal governance.
EPA regulations and incentives encourage innovation and diversification within the American energy industry and make American companies more competitive in the 21st century global economy.
