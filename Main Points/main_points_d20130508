For The Motion
Costly and lengthy approval processes for drugs and medical devices discourages investment and stifles innovation.
The FDA wants a guarantee of benefits, not proof of risks, which means extended testing and clinical trials that keep potentially beneficial treatments from patients.
Drugs are often rejected based on a small risk, despite many proven benefits.
Regulations have been too broad, leading to unnecessary facility closures for upgrades and checks that have created dangerous drug shortages.
Against The Motion
Accelerated approval for drugs, while making potentially beneficial drugs available quickly to patients, also means that they are available for widespread use before their safety can be determined.
The 510(k) approval process, which fast-tracks the approval of medical devices that are "substantially equivalent" to an existing device, releases unsafe devices into the market.
The FDA does very little monitoring of safety and effectiveness once drugs and devices are approved and used by the public.
To those that argue that the approval process is too lengthy, in many cases, the FDA gets a drug on the market faster than Europe.
