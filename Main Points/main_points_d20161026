For The Motion
Itâ€™s not economically or logistically practical to deport 11 million people, and enforcement alone won't work.
Immigrants would earn their citizenship by going through a rigorous process that includes background checks, paying a penalty and taxes, and learning English.
Bringing immigrants legally into the workforce will stimulate the economy, increasing consumption of goods and services, and increasing tax revenue.
The border has never been more secure, the number of crossings has decreased, and we already spend over 17 billion dollars a year on enforcement.
Keeping families of mixed immigration status together is the moral thing to do.
Against The Motion
We need to focus on securing our borders and enforcing the immigration laws that we already have.
There is no way to adequately vet 11 million people for citizenship.
By granting immigrants who are here illegally a path to citizenship, we are essentially rewarding bad behavior and encouraging more of the same.
Wages have stagnated or declined for less-educated U.S. workers, many of whom are forced to compete with immigrants for jobs.
Immigrants pay less in taxes than they receive in government benefits and services.
