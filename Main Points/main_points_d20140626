For The Motion
Political spending is protected under the First Amendment. Of course money is not speech, but it enables free speech and facilitates expression.
Organizations corporations, unions, media outlets, and other voluntary organizations have the same First Amendment rights as individuals.
Limits on spending would mean less political speech in the public square.
Many campaign finance laws serve to protect incumbents.
Against The Motion
Corporations and labor unions are artificial entities and should not be viewed as First Amendment speakers.
Without spending limits, the wealthiest among us have disproportionate political power.
Super PACs and the loopholes that allow for anonymous contributions have given rise to shadow campaigns, groups that are essentially extensions of a candidates campaign.
To argue that independent spending does not lead to, or create the appearance of corruption, relies on a narrow definition of corruption.
