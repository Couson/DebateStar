For The Motion
From Black Lives Matter and the Womenâ€™s March to local and national political campaigns, social media is the driving force behind political organizing today and thus serves as a buttress for modern democracy.
Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube democratize information by allowing all citizens an unprecedented opportunity to have their voices heard and to hold the powerful accountable, free from censorship by government or traditional media gatekeepers.
Propaganda, bullying, and harassment are hardly new phenomenons and are not unique to social media. These platforms should not be maligned for the bad behavior of some users.
Against The Motion
Platforms like Twitter and Facebook have created a toxic online culture that degrades public discourse and promotes ideological echo chambers that increase partisanship and hostility between those with opposing political or social views.
Social media provides unprecedented opportunities for bad actors, including hostile foreign governments, to undermine democratic elections through propaganda and disinformation campaigns intended to undermine political candidates or faith in democratic institutions as a whole.
Whereas traditional media outlets have served as guardians of democracy by safeguarding fact and truth in public discourse, social media outlets allow for the widespread dissemination of false, divisive, and often destructive information.
