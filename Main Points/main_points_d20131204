For The Motion
A meat-free, plant-based, whole foods diet, low in fat and high in fiber, can have immense health benefits, controlling diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, kidney failure, obesity, and other life-threatening ailments.
The majority of meat today is produced on inhumane, industrialized factory farms. And just as it is unthinkable to kill one's dog or cat, the slaughter of farm animals—sentient beings, capable of suffering, happiness, sadness, and intellect—is not ethical.
Farm animal production, one of the leading causes of global warming, has disastrous effects on the environment, including waste, water pollution and shortages, dead zones, deforestation, and soil degradation.
Against The Motion
The most environmentally friendly, ethically responsible, and healthy diet is a not a meat-free one, but rather a locally sourced, sustainably produced one. It is not meat consumption that must end; it is agribusiness's factory production of foods.
The meat, bones, skin, and organ meats of healthy animals provide a balance of nutrients necessary for optimal physical and mental health.
Meat is only unhealthy when it is produced in factory farms where animals are unnaturally fed grains and hormones, infested with bacteria, and pumped with antibiotics.
Animal husbandry is critical to sustainable agriculture, which depends on the balanced, regenerative ecological cycle between humans, the land, vegetation, and animals.
