For The Motion
Democracy will have a liberalizing effect on the Islamists as they are held accountable for governance, not just religious ideology.
The fundamentalists are critical to the moral and political rejuvenation of their countries, and are therefore key to democratic politics in the region.
Representative government empowers citizens, especially religious minorities and women.
Against The Motion
Choosing between the lesser of two evils, U.S.-friendly authoritarian regimes are less of a threat than anti-American Islamists.
The Islamists' openly promise to reform society through Sharia, Islamic law, a concern for liberals, non-Muslims and women.
Elected Islamists are dictators at the end of the day.
They use the tools of democracy, but without separation of church and state you cannot have a true democracy.
