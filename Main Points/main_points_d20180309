For The Motion
Despite good intentions, humanitarian intervention invariably leads to instability, occupation, and the death of innocent civilians.
State sovereignty must be respected on the world stage. Unless acting in self-defense or facing an imminent threat, nations have no right to use military force against another state.

Against The Motion
Wealthy nations have a moral obligation to prevent crimes against humanity wherever they may occur. Failure to intervene constitutes a failure to lead.
All U.N. member states have endorsed the Responsibility to Protect doctrine, a global political commitment to halt or prevent genocide and war crimes. These states have an obligation to uphold this promise.
Violent civil wars often have spillover effects, leading to regional instability that could threaten global security
