For The Motion
Because law-enforcement cannot be present at every crime, having guns in the hands of the law-abiding populace deters crime.
As seen in Washington D.C. in 1976, Chicago in 1982, and the UK in 1997, bans on guns encourage only law-abiding citizens to relinquish their firearms and directly result in increased crime rates.
Policies that allow law-abiding citizens to carry weapons while also restricting those with a history of violence from gun ownership make it more challenging for criminals to successful commit their intended crimes.
Against The Motion
Widespread gun ownership does not deter criminals; it simply normalizes gun presence in day-to-day life and compels criminals to use guns in their illegal acts.
Civilians that look to guns for personal security are often poorly trained and may do more harm than good when attempting to prevent a perceived crime.
Prevalent gun ownership fosters a secondary market in which guns are sold or lent to individuals who are not licensed or eligible to own a weapon and who harbor the intent to commit crimes.
