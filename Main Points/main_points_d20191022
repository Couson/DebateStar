For The Motion
European regulators have declared war on American tech companies. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation represent bureaucratic overreach and will end up hurting tech companies and consumers alike.
Silicon Valley was built on the idea of disruption, and innovators need the free market in order to create. Regulations will stifle creativity and could discourage budding tech innovators, which does a disservice to all.
European regulations on content are stifling free speech on American tech companies’ platforms – and, therefore, in our public discourse – and are an affront to First Amendment principles.
Against The Motion
Brussels isn’t waging war on Silicon Valley. Instead, regulators are working to win for the good of the people by guidingSilicon Valley into a new era that allows users to control their own data, which will ultimately benefit all.
American tech companies are selling out tech users by violating their privacy, sharing their data, and putting their identities at risk. It’s about time that regulators reined in Big Tech.
Europe’s regulatory stance against hate speech is long overdue and will improve social media platforms for users all over the world by promoting tolerance and inclusivity.
