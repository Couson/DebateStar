For The Motion
China has emerged from the global financial crisis seemingly unscathed. Europe's hope that it will tap into its $3 trillion in reserves for a bailout only solidifies its newfound economic dominance.
In contrast to the political gridlock in the U.S., China's authoritarian government has the ability to mobilize its resources—impressive investment in infrastructure is one—and to make difficult decisions quickly, without fear of political retribution.
Since introducing capitalist economic reforms in 1978, China has lifted $300 billion people out of poverty.
With the 2nd highest corporate tax rate in the world, 35%, the U.S. is not business-friendly. China's rate is 25%.
Against The Motion
A weak economic foundation, widespread corruption and growing inequality, will bring an end to China's unprecedented growth.
With its gross national income per capita at 7,570, China trails Ecuador, Kazakhstan, and Romania, and falls well behind the U.S. at 47,120.
An authoritarian government means that there are no checks and balances; gridlock or not, America's divided government was created for a reason.
Companies rarely pay the full 35% in corporate taxes. In fact, once adjusted for deductions, the average corporate income tax is on par with other industrial nations.
