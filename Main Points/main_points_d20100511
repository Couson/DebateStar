For The Motion
Obama has slighted numerous American allies and brought into question not only the strength of American alliances, but the fate of existing international organizations.
The Obama administration has stepped back from America’s traditional role as a dominant global leader and allowed the growth of Russia and China, weakening the United States both at home and abroad.
Under President Obama, the United States has failed to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions and it has failed to invest the resources necessary to succeed in Iraq and Afghanistan, thus contributing to the ongoing destabilization of the Middle East.
Against The Motion
Since President Obama took office, the U.S. has enacted a series of stabilizing measures in the Middle East, including extending the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, increasing troop presence in Afghanistan, and galvanizing the United Nations to increase sanctions on Iran.
The Obama administration rightfully embraced the role of other nations in global leadership and reduced international distrust of American leadership and interests.
Under Obama, the United States has been at the forefront of calls to unify the world in combating shared challenges, including climate change and nuclear proliferation.
