For The Motion
By promoting market competition and rewarding innovation, capitalism has lifted billions out of poverty and ensured consumers have access to cutting-edge ideas and products while hard-working and industrious workers reap the rewards of their efforts.
Under the capitalist system, workers from every social and economic backgroundhave the opportunity tocompete in the free market and to have their talents recognized. This promotes social equality and provides for upward social mobility.
Capitalism provides workers and consumers alike the freedom to choose where to earn and spend their money, contributing to an overall society where the free exchange of goods and ideas is paramount.
Against The Motion
Capitalism serves the interests of large corporations and business, not consumers or workers. Rather than benefiting individuals, the market system prioritizes profits and contributes to social harms including income inequality and poor labor conditions.
Free markets are often criticized for disproportionately benefittingthose who have existing resources and capital to support their vision. Plus, capitalism often depreciates thosewho are not able to work and produce wealth.
Some argue that capitalism is dependent on a culture of consumption, which can lead to unsustainable waste and social and environmental problems globally.
