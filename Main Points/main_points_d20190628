For The Motion
Rising nationalism, populism, and Euroscepticism on both sides of the Atlantic is eroding trust in international institutions and the liberal world order, damaging transatlantic relations beyond repair.
President Trump’s criticisms of European allies, tariff threats, and departures from multilateral negotiations could suggest that an “American First” foreign policy leaves Europe behind.
Considering botched interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, the transatlantic relationship was damaged long before Trump: Europe has been pulled into too many wars it doesn’twant to fight.
The United States is pivoting away from Europe to other parts of the world – primarily Asia – and is increasingly unwilling to defend its Western allies.
Against The Motion
Despite a handful of surprising election outcomes, the trend toward populism and nationalism is overstated. Western liberal values, and relations between countries that espouse them, will prevail.
Though some Europeans are at odds with President Trump on issues like the JCPOA and the Paris Agreement, the transatlantic relationship’s foundation is strong: It has endured hard times before and will again.
NATO is necessary for collective security:Europe and the United States may havesome disagreements over when to use military force, but that doesn’t mean they will abandon one another.
The West shares similar interests and threats. Unless China stops its impressive rise on the world stage, compelling the United States to shift its focus and resources, the U.S. won’t turn its back on Europe.
