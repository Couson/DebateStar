For The Motion
Even if nothing happens on the ground, becoming a full member state would elevate Palestine's status politically and morally.
Two decades of negotiations have gone nowhere, and Israel continues to build settlements. What are the other peaceful alternatives?
Negotiations have become counterproductive, and by going to the U.N. Palestinians are seeking a multilateral solution. Of the 193 members of the General Assembly, more than 120 support a Palestinian state.
According to the World Bank, "if the PA maintains its performance in institution-building and delivery of public services, it is well-positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near future."
A Palestinian state should be recognized along 1967 borders, including Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.
Against The Motion
The bid for full membership is largely symbolic. The Palestinians would first need 9 out of 15 votes from the U.N. Security Council, and the U.S. has already promised to use its veto power.
The only way to peace is through direct negotiations. Full membership to the U.N. would change nothing on the ground.
Going through the U.N. is a unilateral act that will derail peace talks, aggravating relations with the U.S. and provoking punitive behavior from Israel.
Declaring a Palestinian state along 1967 borders undermines future negotiations by taking away the necessity to compromise.
The Palestinian Authority is not in full control of the West Bank and Gaza, and therefore does not meet the requirements for a state.
