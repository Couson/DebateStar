For The Motion
As industries become more automated, the need for human workers will decrease. In the face of such disruption, a guaranteed basic income would be an effective way to ensure economic stability for everyone.
In the face of growing inequality, a universal basic income would substantially reduce poverty and address a spectrum of social issues including food security and access to health care and housing.
Without the pressure to earn a basic income, people would be able to pursue their career interests, leading to greater societal innovation and professional satisfaction.
Against The Motion
A guaranteed income would disincentivize work and stifle productivity. Automation in the workplace should be met with innovation in worker training and education rather than financial handouts.
Rather than giving money to those who are not in need, the government should direct federal funds to successful existing programs, such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
We canâ€™t afford it: according to CBPP, if everyone received a UBI of just $10,000 a year, it would cost the federal government more than $3 trillion dollars.
