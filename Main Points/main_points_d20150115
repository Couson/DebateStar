For The Motion
Low book prices are good for readers and encourages book buying, which benefits authors and publishers.
Amazon is an innovator that single-handedly saved book publishing with the success of its Kindle e-book reader.
Amazon democratizes the market by introducing readers to books from self-published authors and small presses.
Against The Motion
Low e-book prices ignore the cost of investment made by book publishers and the important role they play in bringing books to market.
Books play a vital cultural role and placing so much control in the hands of one company will be harmful to the exchange of ideas.
Amazon's predatory pricing stymies competition and squeezes suppliers.
