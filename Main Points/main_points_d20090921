For The Motion
Increasing production costs on civic projects, like critical infrastructure repair, by mandating the purchase of higher-priced American goods costs taxpayers more while delivering less.
When American companies are mandated to purchase higher-cost American products, they hire fewer workers and create fewer jobs.
Without the ability to hire the best and brightest from around the world, American innovation will suffer while foreign markets become more competitive.
Against The Motion
“Buy American/Hire American” policies ensure American companies, and consequently American workers, are the beneficiaries of municipal projects funded by American taxpayers.
Buying American helps to sustain the nation’s industrial economy, which creates demand for engineering and innovation on American soil.
Many of America’s trade partners, like France and China, have enacted domestic policies that ensure state funds benefit national companies—the U.S. must do the same to remain competitive.
