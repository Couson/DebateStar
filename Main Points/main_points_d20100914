For The Motion
We are a nation at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. This war is global in scope, and only the laws of armed conflict will keep us safe.
The President, the Congress through the Authorization for Use of Military Force, and the Supreme Court through its Hamdi decision, have all declared that we are a nation at war.
The opposing side would like to give Geneva Convention rights to terrorists, even though they violate all rules of war.
The reason there hasn’t been another terrorist attack since 9/11 is because we abandoned a law enforcement approach to terrorism.
If you are taking the law enforcement approach to interrogation, patience is a virtue. If you are trying to stop a terrorist attack, patience is deadly.
Against The Motion
We have a robust criminal justice system. Law enforcement works hand in hand with intelligence—they don’t wait until after a crime has been committed, they are working to detect crime before it happens.
It’s a misperception that reading people Miranda rights means they’re never going to talk. It’s true that some are advised to remain silent, but quite often, people will divulge a great deal of information.
Locking people up indefinitely without charge and subjecting them to a full range of interrogation techniques is fundamentally un-American.
Ask yourself: Should we sacrifice our ideals, our history, and our beliefs as a nation for security? And is this security real, or temporary?
We do have the power to detain and remove from the battlefield people engaged in active conflict. The problem is that the war has been defined in such amorphous terms that there’s a claim of a global battlefield that includes the United States.
