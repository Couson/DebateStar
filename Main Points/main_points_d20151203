For The Motion
Affirmative action in admissions violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against some students based on their race.
Racial and economic diversity on campus can be accomplished through means other than affirmative action.
Affirmative action hurts its intended beneficiaries by creating an academic mismatch between some students and universities.
Against The Motion
Affirmative action safeguards equal protection in university admissions by countering disparities of access and a legacy of past discrimination.
To say that laws designed to subjugate a race and laws designed to distribute benefits to a race are equivalent assumes that our society is post-racial, which it is clearly not.
Everyone's educational experience is enhanced when there is diversity in classrooms.
