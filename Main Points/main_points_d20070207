For The Motion
While the separation of church and state is heralded as a cornerstone of American democratic ideals, many U.S. laws and policies are based in religious values, particularly those governing the right to marry and the inclusion of Evolution in school curriculums.
Though there is no religious requirement to run for public office in the U.S., many politicians invoke religious values and seek support from religious organizations to win elections.
Despite the American promise of a secular government, American taxpayers subsidize religious organizations through tax-funded grants and the availability of tax benefits to religious groups.
Against The Motion
Any attempt to limit an individual’s ability to employ their religious beliefs in their political actions would violate American’s First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and freedom of speech.
Americans face no political or economic penalty for choosing not to associate with a religious community or organization, and secular citizens are guaranteed equal protection under the law.
As moral values decline and social need increases, Americans would benefit from a renewed commitment to religious values like caring for the sick or helping the needy.
