For The Motion
This deal is the best of our alternatives, more sanctions that fail to deter the pursuit of nuclear weapons, or war.
Obama's deal would block all or Iran's paths to a nuclear weapon by limiting its ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium and uranium, constraining R&D, and increasing access for inspections.
Iran's breakout ability would go from 2-3 months, to a 1 year for 10 years.
Against The Motion
This deal leaves Iran with its nuclear infrastructure in place.
Despite claims that inspections and increased access will prevent cheating, Iran's past clandestine activities suggest otherwise.
By lifting sanctions we are strengthening Iran's regional influence, and making their reinstatement virtually impossible.
