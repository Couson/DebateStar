For The Motion
Foreign aid sent to Africa undermines national agency and allows outsiders to yield undue influence in the region.
Despite substantial investments in African development, quality of life for many African people is still critically low and the money intended to help the most desperate simply isn’t reaching them.
Aid money, which is allocated based on the funders’ priorities, impacts national agendas and creates a culture of dependence that stifles real growth and development.
Against The Motion
Assistance programs, such as those that eradicated smallpox and currently fight AIDS, are critical to ensuring the safety and health of many individuals in Africa.
Externally funded programs that prioritize African needs and interests create meaningful and lasting change in African social and economic structures.
In addition to moral arguments for sending aid to Africa, there is an inherent global security interest in promoting African development and fostering economic, social and political stability in African nations.
