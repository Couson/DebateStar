For The Motion
Match-making algorithms are grounded in a false logic that suggests a ‘soulmate’ can be determined by a series of characteristics and lifestyle preferences. Further, they filter away potential connections based on arbitrary metrics like hair color, height, and Facebook likes.
Be it racist or sexist comments, coarse language generally, or unsolicited personal photos, dating apps are a breeding ground for bad behavior that not only degrades romance but society itself.
Apps like Tinder have made dating an exercise in excess. Why settle for one match when thousands of others are just a swipe away?
By necessity, dating apps are designed to keep users from long-term commitments like marriage. If lasting love was the goal, the sites would go out of business.
Against The Motion
Using targeted algorithms, dating apps help users find compatible life partners who share similar values, aspirations, and interests.
By bringing singles from various social, economic, and geographic backgrounds together, dating apps break down barriers associated with traditional dating and foster meaningful connections across cultures and social strata.
Easy-to-use apps make dating simple and accessible. This is particularly noteworthy for LGBT singles, single parents, and those over 55, who have turned to online platforms to find love in record numbers.
The financial success of digital dating is a testament to its effectiveness. If users were disappointed by outcomes, they would leave the platforms.
