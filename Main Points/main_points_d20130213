For The Motion
Unfettered access to genetic engineering for the wealthy will deepen social inequality and create a genetic ruling class.
Children should not be science experiments.
There are potential, unknown side effects that could not only affect the child, but generations to come.
Against The Motion
Genetic engineering can and should be the voluntary choice of parents and will not be a state-mandated program of eugenics.
We already enhance our bodies in so many ways, isn't this the natural next step? Shouldn't we be open to the possibility of pushing our limits and improving ourselves?
It would be immoral not to give children the best opportunities in life—free of disease, given desirable traits—and to shape a better society.
Science and technology requires risk for progress and innovation and we cannot prohibit genetic engineering based on hypotheticals.
Genetic engineering would lessen social inequalities once the technology becomes widely available.
