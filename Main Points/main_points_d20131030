For The Motion
Allowing people to move as freely as goods and capital would benefit the world's economy, by some accounts, doubling the global GDP and bringing an end to poverty.
Freedom of movement, as well as equal access to opportunity, is a basic human right. Open borders would end the arbitrary discrimination against people based on their place of birth, allowing those trapped in third world poverty to access first world opportunity.
Emigrants transfer knowledge and skills back to their developing countries and, via remittances, help to alleviate poverty, develop markets, and increase trade.
The free movement of people strengthens global networks that spur innovation, maximize human potential, and reduce international conflicts.
Against The Motion
Developing countries would not only suffer a brain drain, but tenuous economic development and delayed political and social reform.
Remittances are only a band aid for poverty and do not develop economic infrastructure.
Immigrants are a net fiscal burden, overwhelming an already strained economy and draining public resources like schools, hospital care, and welfare benefits.
Opening our borders would create job competition for native workers, suppressing wages and putting the least-skilled Americans out of work.
The free movement of people could threaten the cultural identities of both sending and receiving countries.
