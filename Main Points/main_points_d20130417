For The Motion
The GOP has alienated key demographic groups—women and minorities—with uncompromising conservatism on issues like immigration and women's rights.
Young Americans are more liberal-leaning. Millennials have grown up in a much more culturally diverse environment and tend to be supportive of progressive domestic issues.
The GOP must embrace pragmatism over fiscal purity.
American's are tired of the political gridlock that prevents us from moving forward.
Against The Motion
The reason GOP candidates fared poorly in 2012 is not because they were too conservative. The problem was that they were too moderate or waffled on core issues, lending doubt to their allegiance to conservative ideals.
Rather than change its message, the GOP needs to change its delivery. Candidates need to be more engaged, and new media and technology needs to be embraced.
Liberal values permeate media and entertainment.
The GOP must expand its focus to all aspects of society.
