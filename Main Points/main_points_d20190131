For The Motion
The risks of reintroducing lost creatures –including unknown ancient pathogens, disruptions in ecosystems, and geopolitical conflict – outweigh the potential benefits to climate change.
The use of CRISPR gene-editing technology to recreate extinct creatures, or using live animals as surrogates, represents a radical departure from traditional conservation practices.
It is unethical to bring back extinct animals when their ecosystem no longer exists. Further, skeptics allege de-extinction poses a moral hazard that trivializes death and allows humans to “play God.”
Against The Motion
Reintroducing megafauna, such as the woolly mammoth, could help reduce the impact of climate change in regions like the Arctic and rebuild the biodiversity that humans have destroyed.
De-extinction is the next logical step in conservation science; humans have been engaging in the evolutionary process for millennia.
Humans are largely responsible for recent animal extinctions and, as stewards of the Earth, have a moral responsibility to bring back what was lost.
