For The Motion
The U.S. can use lethal force against a citizen abroad if he/she is a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or an associated force when they pose an imminent threat, capture is infeasible, and it is conducted in a manner consistent with law of war principles.
The president's authority to respond to this threat arises from Congressional authorization, AUMF, and the inherent right of national self-defense. The executive branch's weighing of evidence meets the due process requirement. Its decision does not require judicial approval.
The U.S. is engaged in non-international armed conflict with al Qaeda and its associates, a fight that is not limited in geographical scope.
Against The Motion
The public does not know what the selection process is, or who signs off on it. Due process requires that government discloses the criteria by which U.S. citizens could be put to death.
Giving the president unchecked authority will lead to abuse. There must be a role for the court in this process, even if it occurs after the fact.
Despite what the administration claims, the world is not a battlefield, and the president does not have the authority to kill anyone he wants wherever he wants. "Imminence" is one of the standards used to determine whether a targeted killing is lawful, but the administration has redefined it to go beyond how it is used in domestic and international law.
