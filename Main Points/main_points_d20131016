For The Motion
Five banks comprise over half the U.S. financial system, a systemic risk to the economy that threatens to destabilize the entire country.
When they are perceived to be too big to fail, banks benefit from an implicit government subsidy that allows them to engage in risky behavior.
The big banks are too complex to manage, making internal and external governance ineffective.
Mega-institutions disproportionately affect public policy due to their size and lobbying power.
Against The Motion
Dramatically restructuring big banks would disrupt the financial system and economic growth, and result in unintended consequences.
Consumers benefit from the economies of scale that big banks can provide.
A bank's size does not necessarily indicate systemic importance, and size restrictions would be completely arbitrary.
The big banks were not the primary cause of the financial crisis. The first institutions to fail were not the big universal banks, but institutions like Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, Lehman Brothers, Countrywide, AIG.
