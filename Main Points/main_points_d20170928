For The Motion
The American health care system was built for profit. Doing away with the financial incentives that drive skyrocketing costs and limit patient outcomes will require total system overhaul.
Given deeply entrenched special interest groups, lawmakers are unlikely to make the drastic -- and costly -- changes necessary to fix American health care.
Americans have grown accustomed to lackluster care. Without widespread consumer demand for market overhaul, Americans will continue paying more and receiving less.
The United States health care system is outdated and deeply fragmented. True reform would require widespread modernization and integration and a rebuke of current practices.
Against The Motion
Seeking a complete remodel of the existing heath care system wastes valuable time and resources. American consumers would be better served by targeted regulations that reign in abuses and set the marketplace on a course for success.
With a few incremental policy changes, such as expanding the insurance market through mandatory enrollment and cost offsets for low-income buyers, the United States can provide affordable, quality health care without overhauling its existing system.
The power of special interest groups may be declining. Given widespread demand for affordable care, lawmakers will soon have no choice but to act on health reforms or lose elections.
Innovative medical professionals, administrators and providers alike, are already enacting meaningful changes within their own organizations. They prove that quality care, at affordable costs, is possible.
