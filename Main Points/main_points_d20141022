For The Motion
With economic growth funneled to those at the very top, the rest of America has suffered from stagnant and falling incomes.
According to EPI, "in 2010, the bottom 90 percent received only 55.5 percent of all income and held just 23.3 percent of all wealth."
As inequality grows, "the consequences of an accident of birth" become bigger. Only those at the top will have the resources to invest in their children's education and overall development.
Economic growth depends on consumption by the middle class, and as more and more Americans fall behind, the more volatile the economy becomes.
Against The Motion
Gains by some do not mean losses for others. While the wealthiest have benefited the most from economic growth, this point does not cancel out the fact that the living standards of most Americans are better now than they were in the past few decades.
Economists have found that despite increases in inequality, social mobility has not changed since the 1970s. In fact, research shows that there is no relationship between high inequality and low mobility.
A thriving economy needs income inequality. It's the wealthiest among us who take on risk and invest in the innovation that benefits everyone.
