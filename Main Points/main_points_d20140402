For The Motion
Online education will modernize our academic institutions, which have relied on the same stagnant model for centuries.
MOOCs have the potential to democratize and equalize education at a global level, breaking down financial, social, and physical barriers to entry.
The internet provides spaces and tools that are far less costly and far more innovative than what the traditional classroom is able to offer and accommodate.
Against The Motion
Online education cannot adequately supply the invaluable elements of the traditional classroomâ€”direct interaction, guidance, accountability, and community building.
To enroll in online classes, students must already have access to computers and high speed internet. Rather than democratizing higher education, MOOCs reinforce educational barriers.
With its disparate accreditation systems and tenuous financial model, online education is not a sustainable replacement for brick-and-mortar institutions.
