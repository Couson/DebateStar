For The Motion
The rich already pay their fair share. The top 1% pays nearly 40% of all collected federal income taxes. The bottom 50% pays just over 2%.
Taxing the rich more won't solve the deficit problem. According to the Tax Foundation, taking all the income of those making more than $10 million per year would only reduce the deficit by 12% and the debt by 2%. Taxing millionaires at 50% would reduce the deficit by 8%.
We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. The U.S. government runs sustained deficits because it spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little.
Tax hikes for those making $250,000 or more means hurting job creators and small businesses.
Against The Motion
For the top 0.1%, the average tax rate has fallen from 51% to 26% in the last 50 years. Average tax rates for the middle class has risen slightly or remained constant over the same time period.
The rich can afford to pay more. The after-tax income of the top 1% has risen to nearly four times what it was since 1979, while income for the middle 60% rose by just 40%. After taking inflation into account, in the past decade the real income of the average American family has fallen by about 6%.
Higher tax rates do not mean less growth. During his first year in office, President Clinton pushed through tax increases that led to 32 straight quarters of economic growth and a budget surplus.
The rich can start businesses and hire employees, but if no one can afford to buy what they have to sell, those businesses will fail and those jobs will be lost. Ordinary middle-class consumers are the real job creators.
