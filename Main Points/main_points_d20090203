For The Motion
The common practice of chandelier bidding, in which an auctioneer introduces bids on behalf of the seller until a desired price is met, manipulates buyers and artificially inflates the art market.
Though works of art have become serious financial assets, the government treats art as a luxury market that does not require the oversight and regulation mandated in other major markets.
Unlike securities, there are no two works of art that are identical, in the same condition or endowed with the same credentials; the only source of price comparison is auction data bases, which are flawed.
Against The Motion
The art market is rightly valued based on public appreciation of the art; the government does not have a place in assigning financial value to specific works.
If someone were to lose money in the stock market, they wouldn’t hang their stocks on the wall; the art market is based on more than an economic exchange and thus shouldn’t be held to the same expectations.
Unlike other commodities that can be valued in comparison to similar goods, the value of art is subject to historic, emotional and intellectual context.
