For The Motion
While affirmative action was created to serve as a “tiebreaker” between two equally matched candidates, it has been expanded to allow racial preference in the name of campus diversity.
Racial preferences create a stigma around the qualifications of its recipients, and calls into question their ability to succeed in the academic or professional environment.
Enrolling students in universities where their peers are better prepared and better qualified sets them up to do poorly and negates the intended benefits of affirmative action as a social policy.
Students of color should not be expected to serve as a cultural liaison in classrooms; using diversity as a justification for admission is unfair to prospective students.
Against The Motion
Affirmative action rightly corrects a history of oppression and systemic racism that continues to negatively impact people of color.
Affirmative action ensures diversity on campus and in the workplace, to everyone’s benefit.
Using preferences in college admissions, including athletic, legacy, and class-based preferences, is a deeply ingrained practice.
Decisions based on standardized tests and secondary school quality unfairly favor students with more affluent backgrounds; affirmative action serves to mitigate this inequality.
