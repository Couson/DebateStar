For The Motion
Autonomous vehicles are safe, sustainable, and energy-efficient. They remove the possibility of human error and can help reduce traffic and pollution.
Driverless cars could give humans the gift of time: Instead of operating a vehicle, commuters will be able to focus on conducting meetings, reading, eating, and resting.
For people with physical limitations, transportation presents many obstacles. Driverless cars can solve these problems by providing them with greater accessibility and mobility.
Against The Motion
Trusting technologies to drive at high velocities raises safety concerns, and there are already instances of self-driving malfunctions leading to injuries and even fatalities.
Automation is already hurting American workers and autonomous vehicles could add to this issue, potentially taking jobs away from professional drivers all over the country.
It is undesirable to leave an ethical judgement, such as a decision of whether to injure a passenger to save a bystander, up to a robot. Only humans can respond and react to these unique situations.
