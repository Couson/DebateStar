For The Motion
The law of demand determines that as the price of labor increases, the demand for it will decrease, hurting the lowest paid workers that the minimum wage is protecting.
The minimum wage adversely affects low-skilled and unskilled workers by preventing them from taking jobs that, while low-paying, would give them the experience needed to get better jobs in the future.
The minimum wage is bad for employers, especially small businesses. It means raising the cost of labor, cutting back on worker hours, cutting jobs, passing on higher costs to customers, and lowering profits.
There is no evidence that increases in the minimum wage have reduced poverty. In fact, the benefits of the minimum wage are often felt by those who are second or third earners in households above the poverty line.
Against The Motion
A worker earning $7.25 an hour, the current federal minimum wage, working 40 hours per week, will still end up below the federal poverty threshold.
Increasing low-income workers' pay will act as an economic stimulus. When they earn more they will spend moreâ€”putting more money back into the economy. Increasing the minimum wage does not decrease employment.
The minimum wage actually makes low-paying jobs more appealing, reducing turnover and vacancies. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 84.1% of low-wage earners are over 20 years old and nearly half of them would benefit from an increase in the federal minimum wage.
