For The Motion
Football has no place in institutions of higher learning, where it essentially functions as a minor league for the NFL.
It is a billion dollar business that grows increasingly corrupt, where the average salary for major-college coach was $1.47 million and players see none of the revenue.
Growing evidence for brain injury and elevated dementia rates for football players—violence and suffering for the entertainment of others—have led critics to compare the sport to dogfighting.
Against The Motion
Players learn discipline and teamwork, and unlike professional athletes, play for history, tradition, and school pride. For colleges, football teams help to build a sense of community and tradition among students and alumni.
Scholarships allow many young men to attend college who wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity, and playing for a university gives them access to first-class coaching and game experience.
There will always be risks involved in playing a contact sport, but education, rule changes, and better equipment can make it much safer without affecting the integrity of the game.
Revenue from sports like football and basketball go toward academics as well as subsidizing the cost of other college sports.
