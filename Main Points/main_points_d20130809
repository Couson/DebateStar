For The Motion
There are no vital American interests in this conflict.
The opposition is a fractured group that is becoming increasingly radical Islamist.
U.S. aid would almost certainly backfire in the future.
Any military intervention by the U.S. will lead to an escalation in what has become a regional proxy war.
Against The Motion
The U.S. cannot afford to allow the conflict to further destabilize the region.
A win for Assad will be a win for Iran and Hezbollah.
The security of Syria's chemical weapons, the largest stockpile in the Middle East, is at risk of falling into the hands of terrorists.
The death toll has topped 100,000 and the number of refugees is in the millionsâ€”the U.S. has a responsibility to act during this humanitarian crisis.
