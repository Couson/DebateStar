For The Motion
Edward Snowden's leaking of top-secret government surveillance programs have sparked much-needed debate, and have raised what even the president concedes are "legitimate policy questions."
Snowden has done this country a great service by exposing the NSA's abuse of authority and illegal programs. Proposed intelligence reforms from the president, Congress, and the White House's own task force only underline the fact that his actions were justified.
Snowden has stated that he reported his concerns to superiors. No action was taken, and he was forced to take his information public.
Against The Motion
Snowden's leaks have been damaging to the U.S. Beyond the NSA's domestic surveillance programs, he has also released information related to international spying; information that has compromised our security and tipped off our enemies.
The programs and operations Snowden revealed are legal, and it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made at the NSA.
Snowden should have taken his concerns through proper channels or to a member of Congress before leaking to the press.
