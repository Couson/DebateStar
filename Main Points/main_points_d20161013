For The Motion
Medical patent laws created to spur innovation distort the drug market to allow large pharmaceuticalcompanies a monopoly on life-saving treatments and the ability to exploit those in need for monetary gain.
Due to a lack of transparency around drug production costs and insurance subsidies for buyers, pharmaceutical companies are not beholden to traditional market forces like consumer-imposed price limits.
Pharmaceutical companies can charge exorbitant prices for common drugs, even when the actual cost of drug production and distribution are low.
Because most developed nations regulate medical costs and allow state negotiation with drug companies, patients in the United States pay substantially more for pharmaceuticals than do their counterparts around the world.
Against The Motion
Developing life-saving medication requires substantial time and resources; those costs are justifiably passed along to consumers when a drug is viable, and the sale of common drugs subsidizes the development of cures for rare diseases.
Given the financial interests of for-profit insurance companies, hospitals, and medical practices, pharmaceutical companies cannot be blamed for the economic burdens of an out-of-control health care system.
Pharmaceutical innovation eliminates the need for other costly medical interventions, such as organ transplants made obsolete by drug alternatives, and makes health care less expensive as a whole.
Because the American government allows a competitive free market for drugs and does not stifle innovation, the world benefits from American research and development of drugs.
