For The Motion
Universities are not equipped to try or punish crimes, especially those as serious as rape. Though courts may be flawed, creating inferior shadow trials is not the solution.
Campus proceedings are often biased and unfair: a lower standard of evidence means more errors; the accused are denied due process, assumed guilty from the start; and schools have a conflict of interest.
Universities have adopted an increasingly broad definition of sexual assault that is difficult to prove or punish, and trivializes the severity of rape.
Against The Motion
Sexual assault—a form of sex discrimination—creates a hostile environment and violates every student's right to an equal education. Under Title IX, schools have an obligation to deal with these cases.
The criminal justice system is deeply flawed and often inadequate in its prosecution of sexual assault. University proceedings, though not a replacement, offer more immediate remedies.
Campus cases go beyond what courts can provide: they focus on the victim instead of the state, on equality instead of defense, and on civil rights instead of criminal justice.
