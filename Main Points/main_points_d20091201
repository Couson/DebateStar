For The Motion
Because the U.S. has not taken adequate action to prevent the illegal smuggling of weapons across the border, many of the guns used in drug-related violence in Mexico can be traced back to the United States.
The U.S. government has failed to effectively regulate and manage its $65 billion market for illegal drugs and has left Mexico with the geographic disadvantage of being placed between a booming market and a major source of its products, including Colombia and Bolivia.
For decades, America has pressured its allies to prohibit drugs and enforce anti-drug policies; this global criminalization of the drug trade has forced the drug industry to forgo legal conflict resolution structures and resort to violence and vigilante justice.
Against The Motion
Mexicoâ€™s government limits American aid in combating drug-trafficking from Mexico into the United States, claiming that direct U.S. intervention violates Mexican sovereignty.
America is not to blame for the culture of political corruption in Mexican governance that has allowed for the breakdown of Mexican law-enforcement and ability of drug cartels to operate with impunity.
Though Americans are consumers of Mexican drugs, they are not a singular market and the rise of drug cartels in Mexico cannot be solely attributed to the American markets.
