For The Motion
Millions of gallons of water, sand, and chemicals are used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
The use of these chemicals—which may include benzene and radium—threatens water supplies and creates massive amounts of toxic wastewater.
Man-made earthquakes have been linked to the disposal of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing.
Natural gas is not clean. According to the EPA, the amount of methane leaking into the atmosphere during gas production is double what was previously estimated. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is twenty times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, hydraulic fracturing exempt from EPA regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, except in instances where diesel fuel is used. As a result, companies are not required by the federal government to disclose the chemicals used in the fracking process.
Against The Motion
Natural gas burns cleaner than traditional fossil fuels, emitting half as much carbon dioxide and less than a third as much nitrogen oxides as burning coal.
According to America's Natural Gas Alliance, natural gas supports 2.8 million American jobs and shale gas alone will support 800,000 jobs by 2015.
Natural gas is a bridge fuel that buys us time to develop new technology and make renewable energy sources a viable option. As of 2010, natural gas makes up 25% of the energy consumed in the U.S. 45% of the oil we consume is imported, while most of the natural gas we consume is produced here in the U.S.
The natural gas boom helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and brings us a step closer to energy independence and greater security.
