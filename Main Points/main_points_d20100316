For The Motion
Teachers unions should not be the scapegoat for the root causes of failing schools, such as inadequate school funding, unengaged school communities, and ineffective leadership.
Collective bargaining rights ensure quality teachers are incentivized to work in public schools by securing financial incentives, good working conditions, and necessary education resources are readily available.
Teachers unions advocate for education reform, including introducing professional development programs that increase teacher quality and growth.
The states with the highest student achievement are the most unionized, including most prominently Massachusetts, one of the most unionized states in the country which sees higher achievement than any other state.
Against The Motion
Teachers unions were created to advocate for teachers, and consequently prioritize teachers’ interests — such as compensation and job stability — over the educational interests of students.
Teachers’ unions take measures to ensure membership remains high, including prioritizing seniority over performance, blocking teacher accountability measures, and advocating for teachers charged with misconduct, even at the risk of impeding students’ ability to learn.
Teachers unions control both sides of schoolboard bargaining tables, using their political capital to elect schoolboard and other officials who will institute and block reforms as the union sees fit.
In the interest of self-preservation, teachers unions have coerced states into capping the number of charter schools able to open in certain districts, effectively blocking school choice for many parents.
