For The Motion
The Obama administration has privately and publically offered direct, unconditional talks to the Iranian regime and the Iranians have failed to respond: there is no active diplomacy with Iran.
Successful diplomacy with Iran requires both meaningful incentives and the threat of military force if diplomacy should fail; neither has been implemented by the Obama administration.
The Obama administration's unrequited attempts to engage in dialogue with Iran displays American weakness in the region and constitutes a failure to act on Iranian aggression.
Against The Motion
While U.S. diplomacy with Iran has been unsuccessful, future diplomacy to quell Iran’s nuclear ambitions will include the Russians, Chinese and the European Union and should be pursued.
Ending diplomacy would collapse any potential for a peaceful outcome and would allow Iran to build a nuclear arsenal unencumbered by American interference.
The U.S. would not benefit from taking unilateral action against Iran and, until America’s allies are convinced that a good faith effort has been made, the U.S. should continue pursuing diplomacy.
