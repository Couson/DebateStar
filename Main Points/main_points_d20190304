For The Motion
The First Amendment is content-neutral and provides a nonpolitical framework for regulating speech. It would behoove social media companies to abide by it.
Rather than resort to censorship, social media companies can offer users tools that block unwanted content, including content that could be hurtful or offensive.
Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms have become the new public square. Rather than resorting to corporate speech policies, these companies should promote free speech principles in the U.S. and abroad.
Against The Motion
Social media companies are global. The U.S. Constitution is based on American values and, therefore, should not be used to regulate international platforms.
The spread of hateful digital content dilutes meaningful discourse and, in some cases, causes emotional and physical harm. Social media companies have a duty to offer safe, welcoming platforms for users.
From election interference to “fake news,” nefarious actors are using social media to undermine democracies and deepen partisan divides. Social media companies must act to prevent this type of conduct.
