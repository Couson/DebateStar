For The Motion
America's standing in the world and American security have both deteriorated under Obama's policy of retreat.
The president has strained our relationships with allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, while embracing enemies like Iran.
He has repeatedly signaled to our adversaries that red lines and bad behavior will be ignored, when effective diplomacy requires the real threat of action to back it up.
The Middle East is now worse off than when Obama first entered office.
Against The Motion
Obama has used restraint when faced with hard choices, moving away from the "playbook" of default militarized response.
Proponents of more muscular intervention in the Middle East ignore the risk of getting mired in further conflict, and overestimate our ability to influence the region's trajectory.
The killing of Osama bin Laden,the Iran deal, the Paris climate agreement, restored relations with Cuba are all evidence of success.
After inheriting two wars and a financial crisis, Obama will leave office having made America safer.
