For The Motion
The lower perceived costs of using drones—in dollars and lives lost—have led to their overuse.
There is no clear legal framework for their use. When the rest of the world catches up and develops their own drone technology, the lack of legal norms will have long-term ramifications.
By choosing a quick fix to terrorism, we are abandoning real strategy, all the while alienating and radicalizing local populations.
Against The Motion
The use of precision drone strikes has decimated al Qaeda and Taliban leadership, while limiting collateral damage.
Drones are an important part of our counterterrorism efforts, allowing us to conduct surveillance and gather intelligence that would otherwise be impossible.
We cannot ignore the value of keeping U.S. troops out of harm's way, and the cost savings of using unmanned aircrafts.
