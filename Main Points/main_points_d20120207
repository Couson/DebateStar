For The Motion
Obesity is an epidemic. According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, over 1/3 of adults and 17% of children are obese in the U.S.
Obesity is a major risk factor in some of the leading causes of death in the U.S., like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
The government can and should provide leadership, education, and funds to fight obesity.
Obesity is a substantial burden to health care systems and economies. Medical costs related to obesity in U.S. adults are estimated to be nearly $147 billion per year.
We must decrease the availability of unhealthy food and increase its cost.
Studies have shown that taxes on unhealthy food and beverages and restrictions on television advertising can reduce long-term health costs.
Against The Motion
Government has no business regulating private behavior; it should give people information to make their own decisions.
People do not bear the full cost of an unhealthy diet. If people are forced to bear the costs of their choices through privatized health care, they will have financial incentives to make healthier decisions.
There is no clear-cut way to determine what is healthy and what unhealthy food is.
We are unfairly singling out and punishing a group of people.
The obesity "epidemic" is overblown, and the scientific evidence to support claims of higher mortality is lacking.
