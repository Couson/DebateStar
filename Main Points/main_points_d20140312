For The Motion
Seizing Ukraine will only isolate Russia further, exacerbating the problems it already faces.
Russia's economy has stagnated and its reliance on energy revenue—around half of Russia's total budget revenue comes from oil and gas—leaves it vulnerable.
According to a Credit Suisse study, Russia has the highest level of wealth inequality in the world, apart from small Caribbean nations with resident billionaires. 35% of Russia's wealth is owned by 110 people, while 93% of the population is worth less than $10,000.
Poor public health has led to a shrinking population.
Against The Motion
Russia has 8,500 to 10,000 nuclear warheads and is actively working to replace aging devices and modernize its delivery systems.
Russia's influence in key regions—the Middle East, Asia, former Soviet republics—cannot be dismissed. Its power to veto on the U.N. Security Council means that Russia can and has blocked international action on many key issues.
It is a country rich in natural resources, including oil and natural gas. Gazprom controls nearly 1/5 of the world's gas reserves and currently supplies 30% of Europe's gas.
