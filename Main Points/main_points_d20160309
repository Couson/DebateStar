For The Motion
AI threatens to fundamentally alter the human way of life and should not be developed without adequate planning and foresight.
To say that algorithms can mimic consciousness is to devalue what it means to be human.
Cheap AI labor may replace human labor and deepen the economic inequality between business owners and human laborers.
A self-aware and self-evolving machine could challenge humans for critical resources.
Against The Motion
Fear of the unknown should not prevent the next wave of the technological and human progress.
AI is a potentially life-saving tool that can help cure disease and eradicate human-to-human warfare.
If precautions and regulations are put in place, "human friendly" AI can be developed to serve humans rather than threaten them.
AI technology can preserve the minds of our loved ones as well as society's greatest intellectuals and leaders.
