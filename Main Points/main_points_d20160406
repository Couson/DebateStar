For The Motion
By subsidizing corporations and industries, the U.S. government is distorting markets and the economy.
We've created a corrupt system where industry groups and large corporations lobby the government, and the government in turn rewards them with subsidies.
According to Good Jobs First, the federal government has given away some $68 billion in subsidies over the last 15 years, two-thirds of which has gone to corporations that don't need itâ€”giving big businesses an unfair advantage.
Against The Motion
Government subsidies have backed important R&D programs that have played a critical role in launching new technology, like the Internet and fracking.
Government support is crucial to helping nascent industries break into entrenched industries like the energy sector.
Subsidies are critical to helping U.S. companies compete in a global marketplace where countries like Germany and China are heavily subsidizing industries.
