For The Motion
Organic foods, which are marketed as a healthier alternative, do not provide substantial health benefits compared to foods produced on conventional farms.
While general pesticide use does not pose a major health threat to consumers, the natural pesticides used by organic farmers can be more dangerous than the synthetic pesticides used in conventional farming.
There are a billion hungry people in the worldâ€”we cannot ignore the trade-offs of organic farming, which requires more land and leads to more soil erosion than conventional farming.
Against The Motion
Because organic farming prioritizes land conservation and biodiversity, it provides consumers the option of purchasing goods produced using environmentally conscious practices.
Pesticides, which are banned on organic farms, have been found to harm children and fetuses, and the runoff from their use creates dead zones, areas unable to foster non-algae life, in rivers and oceans.
Organic farm practices ensure animals are humanely raised and protect against antibiotic overuse, which has led to outbreaks of antibiotic resistant bacteria on conventional farms.
