For The Motion
When it comes to ensuring access to high-quality, affordable heath care in America, critics say that Washington has fallen short. Innovative and data-competent retail alliances couldleverage competencies to overhaul and streamline this fractured system.
By pushing out unnecessary middlemen, ending secret pricing negotiations, and disclosing real pharmaceutical costs, employer-led initiatives, including those with retail partners, may be poised to lower costs and improve outcomes in certain sectors.
Rather than relying on inefficient patient-focused or fee-for-service models, retail-affiliated ventures introduce a consumer-focused approach that could make health care more convenient, accessible, and affordable.
Against The Motion
Critics say that emerging retail alliances lack the institutional knowledge to truly transform the United States’ complex and deeply fragmented health care system. Real change to the system requires both insight and support from experts and lawmakers in Washington.
Retailers and employers are typicallyin the for-profit business. And eventually, they could focus more on advancing their bottom line – possibly at the expense of affordable and quality health care for consumers and employees.
In trying to disrupt the U.S. health care system, retailers won’t just push out pharmacy benefit managers and health care consultants. As patients start treating medical procedures like shopping at the mall, they could also put family doctors and hospitals out of business.
