For The Motion
The gas tax is a user fee. The people that pay are the ones that benefit from it.
The federal gas tax has not been raised in over 2 decades. If it had been indexed to inflation, 18.4 cents per gallon then would be 29 cents per gallon today.
Increasing the gas tax is the easiest and most logical way to increase revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, and it will continue to be a reliable revenue source well into the future.
Congress' inability to come up with a long-term solution to provide sufficient funding for the Highway Trust Fund has created uncertaintyâ€”delaying and preventing infrastructure projects across the country.
Against The Motion
Until government learns to prioritize and cut waste, we should not be pouring more money into the Highway Trust Fund.
Instead of collecting and then redistributing funds back to the states, we should let the states take on more of the infrastructure-funding responsibility.
As people drive less and as cars become more fuel efficient, it becomes obvious that the gas tax is not a sustainable funding solution.
If we stopped using the Highway Trust Fund to pay for non-highway projects, like mass transit and bike paths, we would have enough money to build and maintain our roads and bridges.
