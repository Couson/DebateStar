For The Motion
Paying student athletes is only fair. Top grossing college sports generate billions of dollars from athletic tournaments, merchandise sales, and sponsorship opportunities.
Amateurism is a myth. Student athletes are treated like full-time university employees and are held to strict contracts that require countless hours of practice and training.
Paying college athletes is a racial justice issue. The NCAA’s rules on amateurism have a disproportionate impact on minority players.
Many student athletes are forced to prioritize athletics over academics. Top sports programs demand that athletes dedicate enormous amounts of time and energy to sport, limiting their ability to fully benefit from academic scholarships.
Against The Motion
Student athletes are already compensated through high-value scholarship and career training opportunities.
Paying student athletes would undermine college recruitment and the spirit of collegiate athletics. Students would select schools based on potential salary rather than an interest in the colleges’ academic programs.
Universities simply can’t afford to pay student athletes. Fewer than two dozen of the 350 Division I athletic departments actually make money.
Paying student athletes in revenue-generating sports would run afoul of Title IX, which guarantees gender equality in college athletic opportunities.
