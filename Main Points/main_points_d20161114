For The Motion
By isolating like-minded voters in the same congressional districts, gerrymandering creates a class of highly partisan elected officials that reject compromise and promote ideological extremes to appease their constituents.
With established “safe” congressional districts, state and national party resources can be pooled for more competitive districts, creating campaign battle grounds that foster partisan divide in what would otherwise be small, local races.
The practice of “cracking” spreads opposing party voters throughout districts, putting them in the minority. This suppresses ideological diversity and ensures that these voters' voices are drowned out.
Against The Motion
The polarizing impact of gerrymandering is nominal, and other issues are the real drivers of extreme views in politics.
Many districts that strongly favor one party over another are the result of sorting, where individuals choose to live among the like-minded.
The success of longtime politicians has less to do with gerrymandering and more to do with the inherent benefits of running as an incumbent.
The partisan goal of gerrymandering isn’t to create a few completely safe districts, but as many competitive districts as possible for the majority party. This creates more ideologically diverse districts, not ideologically isolated districts.
