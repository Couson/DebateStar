For The Motion
The NSA's metadata collection is both "indiscriminate" and an "arbitrary invasion"that violates the Fourth Amendment.
The long-term collection of phone metadata "reveals a wealth of detail about familial, political, professional, religious, and intimate relationships" that once could only be obtained "by examining the contents of communications."
Various government officials have made clear that there are alternative means and modes of surveillance available, making such widespread violations of our Fourth Amendment rights even more unreasonable.
Against The Motion
Once an American knowingly hands over information to a third party (i.e. a phone company), there is no longer a reasonable expectation of privacy. While the content of the calls remains protected under the Fourth Amendment, the metadata does not.
A Fourth Amendment search does not take place until the collected data is analyzed, which occurs only with probable cause on a very small fraction of the records.
Because this surveillance concerns national security, the government does not need to meet the Fourth Amendment protections reserved for domestic criminal activity. Data mining falls squarely within the president's wartime powers of intelligence gathering; as long as the information is not used in criminal proceedings, there is no need for individualized warrants or probable cause.
