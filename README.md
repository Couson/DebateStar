## DebateStar - A deep mining of persuasive speeches

### Overview

Inspired by IBM Project Debater, we aim to uncover the myth of persuasive debate with
major focus on text data. Using NLP tools such as sentiment analysis and representation
learning, we can extract features from debate texts and study constituents of persuasive
speeches and similarities among good/bad debaters. Finally, for each user to improve
accordingly, a summary with persuasiveness scores after each sentence will be generated
in real time. Thus, the product offers an alternative for debaters to practice their expertise
with minimal cost and time. If time permits, we will incorporate tone changes in audio
and facial expressions in video to extract features beyond texts that affect the
persuasiveness of debate. As claps and long time silence in the audio can function as real
time supervisions, animated simulations can be generated to track the performance of
speakers on timeline. Our model can thus generate more comprehensive advice of
managing emotional expression in the debate.
