for,"So, when I grew up, my parents and my aunts and uncles -- my grandparents -- would tell these jokes. They grew up in socialist Poland, and I just -- but I didn't always quite understand. But I've been thinking back to one of them a lot over the last year. It's pretty straightforward. It plays in a small town in the Soviet Union. And the guy is coming off work late at night. He's walking home. And here's some other guy, completely drunk on the side of the road, throwing up into the gutter. And as soon as he sees the guy, he puts on a big smile. He walks over. He puts a hand on his shoulder, and he says, ""I completely agree with your political analysis, comrade."" I think you understand why I told that joke when I look at what's going on in our politics here in the United States, but also in Europe. It's easy to feel disgust, and I feel disgusted. I feel disgusted when our president denigrates the people who are in need of help at the moment in Puerto Rico. I feel disgust when our president calls neo-Nazis some ""very fine people"" implicitly, in response to Charlottesville. But today, I don't want to talk about disgust and I don't want to talk about emotion. I want to make a rational, careful, calibrated case for why, unfortunately, I do believe that democracy is threatening suicide at the moment. Now, what would it take for us to believe that? If we put our disgust aside, why should we think that democracy is threatening suicide? Well, I think we have to show two sides -- two things to be true on this side of the debate. The first is that people really are quite fed up with democracy -- that they're falling out of love with democracy, that they've had enough of it, in many ways. Now, thankfully, that's something that my academic research speaks to directly. I've shown in the last years that the number of people who say it's important to live in a democracy has gone down a lot. When you ask Americans born in the 1930s and 1940s how important it is for them to live in a democracy, over two-thirds say it's essential to them. When you ask millennials -- like in 1980 -- how important it is for them to live in a democracy, less than one-third say the same thing. Even when you ask about straightforward or offer alternatives to democracy, the number of people who say that they are in favor of that has gone up. 20 years ago, 1 in 16 Americans said that they're in favor of Army rule. Now it's 1 in 6 Americans. 6 percent of young and affluent Americans used to think that Army rule was a good thing, now it's 35 percent, a nearly six-fold increase. And this is not just in the United States. In France, in the United Kingdom. About 1 in 4 people used to say that they want a strong-man leader who doesn't have to bother with Parliament, with elections. Now 1 in 2 do. These are shocking numbers. And they're not just abstract questions that people are asked on surveys. You can see from the results an actual voting behavior. You see the election of Donald Trump in the United States, a man who promised even before the election to keep voters in suspense about whether he would accept the outcome of the election, who threatened to jail his main political -- not adversary, but opponent, in his mind. You see the rise of parties like Alternative for Germany, that is now the third-strongest as of elections 10 days ago. A party many of whose adherence in leaderswant, I quote, ""A 180-degree turn in our understanding of World War II."" So, this is not abstract. It's actually resulting in real action. So, that's the first thing we've got to believe -- that a scary] number of people is fed up with democracy, is becoming more open to alternatives, is threatening to immolate democracy. But there's a second part that we have to convince you as well -- which is that these movements are actually dangerous, that people like Donald Trump, that people like Marine Le Pen, that people like Frauke Petry in Germany, can do real damage to democracy. Now, there's some great examples of that happening in the world. And Bernard-Henri is going to tell you more about some of those cases. We're going to talk about Poland, and Hungary, and Venezuela, and Russia, and Turkey -- and all of those other places where populists, authoritarian populists have been able to undermine independent institutions, to take a lot of power and control. But for the last minute-and-a-half that I have in my opening statement, I want to tell you about the logic of populism, why it is that these populists end up being dangerous to democracy and it’s for a very simple reason. It’s because they think politics is simple, because they think that all of our problems are befall off the elite that is corrupt, is self-serving or cares more about minorities and foreigners than they do about the real people. And it’s this mindset that makes them promise voters everything, get into power and say I’m going to solve everything. And of course, once they get into power they start saying who knew that healthcare could be so complicated? Who knew that keeping the peace of North Korea is not so easy? And so, what do they do? They start to blame. They start to blame independent institutions. They start to attack judges. They start to attack the press. They start to attack minorities. And once somebody who’s in power does that, democracy is in real danger. So those are the two things we want to convince you of today. A lot of people are fed up with democracy. As a result, they’re starting to vote populists, and populists are really dangerous. Now I’m not saying that democracy is doomed. I’m not saying that there’s nothing we can do in response to that. It is threatening suicide. That doesn’t mean that it’s committed suicide yet. And we can stop it. It’s our duty to try and stop it. But to do that, we have to recognize how serious this moment is and start to do whatever we can to save our political system. ",nan
against,"Well, that’s right, I’m going to argue that Western democracy isn’t threatening to commit suicide. Attachment to the democratic principle of government by consent under rule of law is as strong as ever across America and elsewhere in the West. That’s what I want to argue. I do want to stress one thing at the outset. Much of what we’ve seen in Western politics lately, and much of what we’ll be discussing tonight, is disturbing. We’ve seen a rising tide of populism, and this surge has led to some very bad choices of leaders and of policies. Democracy and the rule of law don’t save us from bad choices. They don’t always protect us from leaders that let us down, or from policies that will make us worse off. They don’t prevent mistakes. But they do leave power in our hands so that we can correct those mistakes. That’s the core of the case for democracy. And contrary to what we’ve heard so far, I see no sign in the West of support for this fundamental idea is wavering. Now my partner Kori is going to have more to say about populism more broadly, but Donald Trump and Brexit is seen as leading products of democracy’s self-destructive instincts, so I want to start there. Trump is a loudmouth, a narcissist and a bully. He knows next to nothing about public policy, and he’s fine with that. He may well have authoritarian instincts, and his appeal is in part the appeal of a demagogue. You could say he’s testing the American constitutional system. But you’d also have to say that the American constitutional system is passing this test. Already he’s been checked at every turn by Congress. Again, and again, he’s been checked by the courts. After he fired James Comey as head of the FBI, Trump’s own Justice Department appointed a special counsel of renowned drive and integrity to take the Russia investigation forward. Perhaps Trump will be foolish enough to try to remove Mueller from that post. If he does, more of his supporters will desert, and the odds on his impeachment will shorten dramatically. In other words, our constitutional protections are working. Now, Trump, this leader with authoritarian appetites, let’s call them, did get elected, and he still has a lot of support. So how can I argue that backing for democracy should remain strong? Because Trump -- support for Trump is mainly an act of protest -- not against the principles of democratic governance but against the performance of an entrenched and incompetent political class. Trump supporters consider themselves loyal to the Constitution. They made a bad choice, but it’s a serious misunderstanding to call a protest vote against the dysfunction of Washington, D.C. anti-democratic. I see Brexit in much the same way. Support for taking the U.K. out of the European Union was a protest vote against the leakage of political power to an emerging new order lacking clear lines of democratic accountability. This steady erosion of sovereignty has been exaggerated by Brexit’s advocates. That’s true. But it’s real nonetheless. People feel a loss of control, and they want it back. Now, again, that decision was unwise, in my view. Brexit is going to cause the U.K. dearly. It was a reckless choice. But it was not a vote against democracy. It was a reckless vote in favor of democracy. At this point, supporters of this motion might be inclined to pivot. There’s no authoritarian tendency in Brexit. The vote to quit was passed by a majority in a legally sanctioned referendum. So, the charge can’t be that Brexit is anti-democratic. Instead, it’s deemed illiberal. And the evidence for that, Brexit supporters are disproportionately in favor of tighter restrictions on immigration. And with this, of course, the link to Trump is reestablished. It turns out -- or so goes the argument -- the real problem is bigotry and backwardness. Populism isn’t anti-democratic after all. It’s just the wrong kind of democratic. But this, I think, is another misunderstanding. The foundations of Western liberalism aren’t threatened by an argument over immigration policy any more than they’re threatened by any of the other disputes that democracies exist to mediate. I’m an immigrant myself with a vested interest in permissive immigration policies, but I recognize that the issue isn’t open and shut. High immigration can put some host country workers at a disadvantage, and abrupt surges of immigration do put systems and communities under stress. Liberal democracy should be able to have this debate without collapsing into moral panic about our declining commitment to democratic values. In times of great stress -- and the past decade was that and then some -- voters can lose trust in their leaders and put the wrong people in charge. They might even tell pollsters that democracy is no longer working for them. But here’s the key thing. Not for one second does that mean they want control taken out of their hands or the government to put itself above the law. Western democracy isn’t dying. I ask you to vote against the motion. So, I could tell the story of change in the international order very differently than Bernard-Henri did, because in the 1970s, people said, ""Latin Americans don't care about democracy,"" right? ""They're too poor, their basic needs are what they're focused on."" And now, look at Latin America, right? It's a continent of vibrant democracies. The Brazilians are refusing to stand for corruption in their government, which had been common for the entirety of Brazilian history. In the 1980s, people said, ""Africans don't care about democracy, right?"" And the African continent, while having suffered many setbacks -- because in fact, the transition to democracy, the building of a social fabric, of civil society, and free media, and civic tolerance, and institutions of government that buffer against bad choices in the near term, and the consensual relations of how you are going to pass laws, enforce laws -- these are difficult conversations for every society. And our society in the West is not excelling at them at the moment. I grant the other team that. But when we say we hold these truths to be self-evident, right, the people have rights and they loan them to governments in limited ways. We mean it when we're talking about ourselves. And yet, very often, we don't actually really believe in the universality of what we're saying, right? That Latin Americans want to be able to control their government, that Africans want to be able to control their government. In the 19 -- let's see -- '70s, '80s -- in the 1990s, there was the Asian values debate, right, that the people -- the countries of Asia didn't care about democracy. They were worried about getting rich. Turns out that's not true either, right? People are agitating for the ability to control their government. In the 2000s, there was the question -- oh, I left out Yugoslavia, right? That the -- people of the Balkans didn't care about representative government, they didn't care about the ability to control their government. And now the discussion is about the Middle East. And yet, what have we seen in the Middle East? Not only, as you suggest, the people of the Kurdish regions of Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Iraq yearning for a government that feels representative to them. But the people of Iraq as well, the people of Iran -- the 2009 Iranian parliamentary elections, in which they believed the government had stolen from the people the outcome. And that had to be put down by force -- the peaceful protest marches. The peaceful protest marches you saw in Syria before the government began cracking down on them. People yearn for what we have the luxury of taking for granted. My response to the fact that, you know, these kids these days don't care about freedom and democracy, and they'd just -- be just as happy to live in an autocracy -- yeah. My nephews have the luxury of not knowing anything about World War II, and that's pretty wonderful that they have grown up in freedom so expansive that they can talk nonsense about what kind of government they would like to live under. But nobody's choosing to live under authoritarian governments, right? People aren't -- Americans aren't emigrating to China, because, ""By God, what we would like is an efficient government that would have high-speed trains that work on time."" We don't do that because democracy is messy, and slow, and we're almost always dissatisfied with the process, and we're almost always dissatisfied with the outcomes. But that's the point. We get to change the outcomes. That's a universal yearning -- that every time people get the opportunity to choose it, they choose it. That is the expansive success of democracy in the West; that is, it is not just our democracy that is the measure of the success of democracy, but people in Argentina, people in Brazil, people in China who actually want a government that is responsive to clean air and safe baby milk demands. That’s what will bring the Chinese government down, right? Average people. All of us can identify ridiculous excesses in our politics. In fact, we have elected one president in our country. But the institutions are holding. Civic society is holding. The day President Trump issued his travel ban, the ACLU got 350,000 new members and raised $24 million. There are natural antibodies in democratic societies that get activated when our rights or our practices begin to be undercut. And the reason I believe that you should vote for our side of the argument is that it’s a vote in the ability of rejuvenation in democratic societies. We’re not good at having it right. We’re good at getting it right -- right -- by bits and pieces, by fits and starts, by doing it badly and then doing it a little bit better. That’s the success of democracy in our society.",1.0
for,"I don’t know if it’s really -- you cut to the chase of a core of their argument -- right -- they both said, look, a protestvote doesn’t necessarily mean, well, it’s antidemocratic. You vote for Brexit, you’re fed up with the European Union. It doesn’t mean that you dislike democracy. They said -- Look, perhaps young people have the liberty to say I don’t like democracy, I’m in favor of army rule. They wouldn’t actually enjoy living under army rule. I grant them this point. Both those points are true. But that’s not reassuring, because democracy is a very brittle set of institutions, and once you have an authoritarian populace in power, who is actually trying to undermine independent institutions in every way they can, the fact that people say, oh, you know what, woops, we made a mistake isn’t going to help. When you look at the current Polish government, they were elected mainly on a promise to abolish a $10 charge when you go to a doctor, but they also were populists, and now they have stacked the supreme court of Poland with their own supporters. They have turned state TV into a complete propaganda machine. They have undermined the right of the opposition to protest their policies. Lots of Poles are now saying, you know what, perhaps we made a mistake. We shouldn’t have said it’s going to be fine. But once you have that kind of government in power, it’s really difficult to fight back against it.",2.0
against,"Well, I think Kori wants to. So, I agree with your assessment of the tragedy of contemporary politics in Poland, but I’m not sure that example proves the general case. I can think of two -- so two quick reactions. The first is that you guys haven’t actually answered the question of why is this happening now?And Clive’s answer is that we’re in a time of tumult. The world’s changing dramatically because of technology and globalization, and that’s putting pressure on the system. But the system is functioning as it’s designed to. We think it’s a lot less brittle than you think it is. And I would just use from the American case, we have two presidential examples. There are similar times in the 1820s and the 1880s where you have rapid technological change that roils American politics and throws these populist political leaders up. Andrew Jackson, for example -- much greater threat to the institutions and practices of democracy in America than Donald Trump ever was. But the great thing about democracy is, is that you turn the key in the lock, his adversaries found ways to create counterarguments. And the same thing happens in the 1880s. You get populists coming forward, and then you get the problems that were driving people to populism addressed by democratic means. And we’re in the midst of that process. Can I respond to that? I do agree with you that it isn't enough to say it's a protest vote. And I didn't say it was just a protest vote. I said the Brexit vote was a protest against political reforms that have not been put before Europe's people, that have not been consented to. The fabric of democracy in Europe is changing at a very top-down driven way, and many people -- not just in Britain, but in Britain especially -- many people find that very disconcerting. They feel that they've been cheated, and they're protesting against that. And my point is that that is, in fact, a legitimate protest. And that is a protest in support of democratic values. And although I -- you know, I object to Trump as strenuously as anybody in this room. But there is an element of legitimate protest in the support that carried him to the White House. What is -- so, yes, Trump has the protest vote. What is the protest about? The protest is about a political system that is perceived to be letting people down. And that is not a false assessment. I mean, for -- year after year of opinion polls --",2.0

That seems to be --",2.0

But that's not a reason to think that democracy is threatening suicide and that it's not so easy to solve it. Why are people voting for populists? Why did people vote for Donald Trump? Well, for one, because the living standard average Americans has stagnated. From 1945 to 1960, it doubled. From 1965 to 1985, it doubled again. Since 1985, it's been flat. People are pissed off about that. For another -- because it's complicated, turning a country's with a strict racial hierarchy into an equal multi-ethnic democracy. We’re still struggling with that. There's some people against it. Now, what I want to say is this -- these are deep problems and they are driving real anger.

But it ends up in an undemocratic belief -- each opinion equals the other ones. Every opinions expressed have the same value. This is a single example. Very simple -- when you see how real democratic anger, pretension, desire turns into itscontrary. Today, you are back to the worst regime -- what -- which the Greeks called the ""La Sophistique,"" where every opinion equals the other. And this leads to Donald Trump, in -- about Charlottesville, saying that there is ""two sides."" We are living in a world where we believe that in every single circumstance, there is two sides -- the racists and the anti-racists, the violent and the pacifist -- there are just two sides.

It's creating a sense of anxiety for people about their longevity of their jobs, about the stability of the social order that they have known, about the way things have worked.

I don’t think that for a moment. But the fact that they’re saying, ah, democracy, you know what, that’s not really so important. Who cares about it? I don’t care about politics. Let them do whatever they want. The fact that they’re saying how bad could get things get? You know, if someone like Trump gets elected, we’ll get through it. Let’s not worry about it. That concerns me a lot, because you’ve seenit over and over in different parts of the world, from the Bolshevik Revolution to the current government of Poland, that it doesn’t take great support of a majority of a population to change the system of politics you live in. It takes a determined and well-organized minority who thinks that their views are more important than anything else and they’re just going to go for it. At that point, if a majority of people stand up to them -- At that point, if a majority of people stand up to them, we can keep them back. We can save our democracy. We’re not doomed.

The first is that we weren’t in Germany in 1938 having the kinds of conversations we are having here right now, right? This is what democracy does well. It worries, it airs arguments, it thinks about moderate corrections, it -- so presidential term limits are one great reason, right? It’s a canary in a coalmine if a president stays longer than four years without being reelected. One of the reasons I am not as worried as our colleagues on the other side of the line are is not because I think everything always turns out right. It’s because you have canaries in the coalmine along the way that give you the ability to respond to them. And I think society’s reasonably good at responding to it. And the more institutionalized a democracy is -- the president’s got to get reelected, the courts get a view on everything President Trump does, and he is abiding by those limits. The time I was most worried was when president -- Candidate Trump said that he, you know, wasn’t sure what he was going to think about the outcome of the election. That kind of corrosive undercutting of the norms and behaviors that make our practices meaningful is worrisome. And I think our colleagues on the other side of the line ought to be hitting that one harder.",2.0
for,"Of course, we cannot compare the situations, and the time of Hitler in Germany was absolutely incomparable to anything. And Donald Trump, is far from being comparable to that. But what I want to stress is that the real “dissentiment” we have, I don’t believe that democracy is a natural state of the human being. Democracy is difficult. Democracy is fragile. People sometimes don’t desire democracies. They prefer something else. They prefer nationalism. They prefer national pride. They prefer sometimes war. Democracy is not the most desirable good -- political good in the world. And this is what history has proved very often in the past. Democracy -- because you reason as if there was a sort of natural regulation between democracy and its opposite, and that at the end of the day finishes well. Look at Eastern Europe, Hungary and Poland. They’re interesting. Thirty years ago, we were all convinced that they were joining the circle of democracies with joy and enthusiasm -- which was true. But after a few years, after a few decades, it proved to be not so true. And there is a sort of illiberal democracy, a sort of “démocrature” , like a “dictateure” in these countries which is a very special form of democracy.

I think so many of the things we’re discussing, the differences are rhetorical more than substantive -- except in this one crucial respect. I think you both do feel that democracy, Western democracy, democracy in the U.S., democracy in Western Europe is brittle, is fragile.  I think that democracy in the U.S. and in Western Europe is robust and can handle and is handling a great deal of stress. And I just want to come back, if I may very quickly, and underline this point about the strains that our economies have been under. There is an interesting comparison with the 1930s. We’ve just been through a crash that was as bad as the Great Recession. This was -- that was as bad as the Great Depression. And this happened on the watch of supposedly sophisticated, technically adept governments that knew what they were doing, that understood finance, that all this stuff had been dealt with. But we had a crash like the Great Depression, right? And it is not surprising that people are thrown by that, that people have, as I was saying before, legitimate grievances about that.

How much comfort should we take from a long democratic history in the United States? Unlike in Germany in the ‘30s, here we go back a very long time in our history. Well, I think that in order to conclude easily from the past to the future, we have to assume that the sort of scope conditions, all of the conditions around what is happening now are the same. But all through the history of democratic stability in the United States, we have had a rapid improvement in living standards from one generation to the next. So, people could say do I love politicians, do I trust them completely, no. But you know what? I’m doing a lot better than my dad was. My kids are going to do better than me. Let’s give them the benefit of the doubt. And now all of a sudden, so you know what, I have worked hard all my life and I am not doing better than my parents were. My kids are probably going to do worse than me. Let’s throw some shit against the wall and see what sticks. NPR, NRP. All the through -- over the history of democratic stability, a democracy has been the most powerful country in the world, first your great country, Great Britain, and now my great country the United States.

So, we can’t simply assume that the past is guaranteed of future results, as an Upper West Side audience might recognized bymy finds. Just one other point. You say, Kori, that you were very worried before the election in 2016, because Donald Trump said he might not accept the outcome of the election. I agree. That was the moment I was most worried. And we were spared having to find out what he would have done if he had lost, because sadly he won. Well, I'll tell you what. We have another election coming up.

And I don't deny that bad politicians get elected. Actually, I would like to come back, to link it to what you were saying before -- why don't we get better politicians? The whole point of democracy is that it is robust in the face of bad politicians. There is something about the political process that projects certain kinds of people forward. I mean, I think you have the -- a disproportionate share of seriously flawed individuals running for office. And the beauty of democracy is that it keeps them contained.

I would have thought Barcelona is one of the richest, most affluent, and by the way, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, in the whole world. It's part of a deeply democratic country. What are you talking about? And yet, this past Sunday, we've seen those clashes in the street. We've seen deep political irresponsibility on the part of the Catalan government, which pressed through a referendum with a minority of public support in a legally -- highly dubious way -- voting for the lawful referendum when the opposition was outside of the parliament hall. And then we've seen an even more irresponsible Spanish state saying, ""We're going to quash them with everything we've got,"" instead of saying, ""Let's let them have a vote and ignore it,"" they came in and beat the citizens up.

That is clear, and this image of violence will be like a shame on the Spanish government for long. But Catalonia government was wrong also by reducing the desire of democracy to the only question of who governs, how do we share the power, and so on. They should better deal with the question of Islamism in --attack Catalonia with the way in which they explained before, the terrorist attack in Barcelona, the way in which they dealt with this story of jihadist salafismand so on. So, there is a lack of democratic spirit in Barcelona and in Spain which was compensated by this fight for control of power. I want to go back to the question which was raised by the lady here, this question of why so bad politicians is a crucial question, because for all democrats, since the beginning of democracy, democracy has been a fabric of good politics. One of the signs of a sane democracy, of the real --of a real democracy is the ability to produce some good politics. Since the Greeks when they produced Pericles, to the first --to the beginning of the democracy in Europe, Machiavelli who says that the proof of democracy is the capacity to invent a political art. Machiavelli said that art --policy in the future democracy is an art. That is when he spoke about virtue, he meant virtuosity, like a pianist. For him, politics were like artists. They had to have the virtuosity, the scale, the talent of an artist. Frankly, who is the artist of politics today in Europe or in America? Where are they? We are reduced to qualify Mr. Putin as a sort of artist in strategy, a great chess player, you know that, which is an insult to chess playing. So, this factthat the so-called democracies are unable to produce artists of policy is one of the signs that our motion is a good one, that democracy .",2.0

Elections have consequences. Presidents have the ability to change regulation unless Congress prevents it, or unless the courts determine that it is unconstitutional. So that you get changes to the policies and practices of the EPA is not surprising. That’s what elections produce. And the ability to make those changes is actually proof that the system is working. What I thought you were going -- I thought you were going to go a slightly different direction, which is that the great genius of those few dozen guys who had the big debate about the nature and structure of the American government is that we have a government designed by people who are afraid of concentrations of power, right? You can’t get anything big done in America without consensus. That’s on purpose, and that is actually our greatest protection. I mean, I agree with Clive’s point that President Trump’s malevolence is being outpaced by his incompetence. But there’s also -- there’s also the very serious point that our government’s designed to have to negotiate everybody into an agreement, and governments on both political sides for the last several administrations haven’t done nearly a good enough job of building a broad basis of support. That’s why you see so much seesawing.",2.0
for,"Yeah, I’m trying to remember the exact -- so, look, I think that’s basically right, but there’s a real problem here, that checks and balances work as long as all parts of a government actually have a common purpose in mind. When you read the Founding Fathers, when you read the Federalist Papers, they talk a lot about overcoming factualism by the common or the public good. People working together for that. They were really worried about the country being split into two big factions. They didn’t think of political parties, but they would recognize the Democrats and Republicans precisely as two big factions of a kind that they were scared of. And the problem with the checks and balances is, that when you have so many veto points that nothing can get done because there’s this deep spirit of animosity, of partisanship between both sides of the aisle -- that anytime somebody has a little bit of power, they use it to the max, they start to abuse the institutional norms because now we've got the presidency and we've got to do everything we can. And it goes into the cycle of precisely the blockage of politics, which makes it impossible to deal with the real problems we have been talking about, like the stagnation of the living standards for ordinary people. Then it produces a counter-reaction, where people say, ""When I'm in government, I'm going to do whatever we want,"" and that, political scientists show, is exactly what has happened historically in Latin America -- which had a very similar presidential system, many of those countries, to the United States. And they ended up in these situations of political blockage, where nothing could happen. And eventually, a strongman leader came about and said, ""You know what? I'm going to solve all of this. Just give all the power to me. I'm going to run roughshod over the institutions. I'm going to solve any -- everything."" And you know what you call that person? You call them a dictator.",2.0
for,"Once upon a time, there was a chicken on a farm. And it was very happy. And all of the other animals on the farm kept warning it and saying, ""Be careful. The farmer is only nice to you now. But one day he'll come and kill you, and slaughter you."" And the chicken said, ""What are you talking about? Every day he comes and feeds me. Every day he says some nice things about me. Why would things suddenly be so different?"" That's a story by Bertrand Russell, and he concludes that indeed, that farmer did come and wrung the neck of a chicken -- and more sophisticated views as to the nature of history, it would have been to the chicken's benefit. I'm telling you this story because there some things that are driving the farmer's actions. There'sscope conditions to how he acted. As long as the chicken was thin enough, he let it live. Once it was fattened up for market, he slaughtered it. We cannot conclude from history to the future -- because some things are different now. We have some deep problems and our political societies are failing to address those. And so, we can't assume that just because democracy was stable in the past, it's going to be stable in the future. Ancient Athens lived for 200 years. The Roman Republic lived for 500 years. The Republic of Venice ruled serenely over the beautiful lagoon for over a thousand years. If people in the later stages of those polities had said, ""Perhaps it's going to die in the next 50 years, perhaps the system will collapse"" -- people would have said, ""You're crazy; what are you talking about?"" And yet, eventually, they did. My point is not that democracy is doomed. It is not. We can fight for our democracies. We can save our democracies. But the first step towards that is not to make the mistake the chicken made, not to make the mistake that the Athenians, and the Romans, and the Venetians did at some point in their history -- and recognize that our political system is now under threat, and that it'll take all of us fighting and working together in order to save it.

Actually, I'm not a great optimist. I don't see Trump as a fascist dictator, but I'm under no allusions about the damage he can do in areas where the law grants him authority. I am pretty gloomy about Brexit as well. Although I think Brexit on the merits, is a closer call, I'm worried about what's going to happen to the U.K. economy, and I think it's going to be very difficult.

A few weeks ago, we had the proof of the opposite. France, fatherland of human rights.

It was mostly a protest against migrants being at home and so on. It was more than -- more this than protesting against the European Union and all the system which goes with it. What I want to say is that the best theoretician of American democracy was a Frenchman -- Alexis de Tocqueville. I'm sorry for this, but it's a fact. And he said that democracy was three things. Vote -- of course, number one. But number two, the rule of law. And number three, a certain form of civilization. Tocqueville said that it was a form of freedom of speech, a way of behaving with the other, a way of having a free debate -- and that this, a way also of being, if you want, out of the grasp of power.

We are not newly a society with lots of friction. We are not newly a society that has economic problems, that is uncivil in much of its discourse, that has a lot of serious social problems that we, at times, address inadequately or we fail to live up to our values. Those aren't new things about our country. My favorite article ever written about America in the world is by the journalist James Fallows. And I can't remember the actual title, but his argument is that the reason the United States is successful in the world is because we always think we're failing, right? It's about the role of the Jeremiah. Do you remember Jeremiah from the New -- from the Bible? He always thinks he’s failing. He always thinks humans are failing God, and he’s right. The United States always thinks it’s bad at stuff, right? In the 1970s, the Japanese economy was overtaking us, and now the rise of China is going to be the end of American dominance. We tend to give our opponents all of the advantages of what we struggled so mightily to get right, and there are many things we get right. One of those things is building institutions and building civil society as a counterbalance to the power of government. The distribution of power that we have in Western liberal societies is our great saving grace, and is much more robust than our adversaries this evening give it credit for.
