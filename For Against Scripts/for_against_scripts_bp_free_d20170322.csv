It’s an idea that sounds benign, and while I wish I could like it, my fear is that it puts economically vulnerable people seriously at risk. My partner and my friend is Jason Furman.  I should be using this time to set expectations well, but instead I’ll use it to note that Matt did not graduate from Harvard.",nan
for," Maybe a little irony to start. Until three years ago, I had never even heard of a universal basic income. And tonight, my opponents are my progressive friends, while my partner, Charles, is often my ideological nemesis. So, let me explain how I came to see the power of a universal basic income, offer a specific proposal, while Charles discusses its role in restoring choice and responsibility. Making it clear why a yes vote is really the only viable choice. At 22, my first real job was a welfare worker, determining eligibility for President Nixon's welfare programs. If you had a problem as a client, I had a regulation and a hoop you could jump through. I had no idea that two years earlier, the same President Nixon, with Milton Friedman's assistance, had proposed a far more radical safety net, a guaranteed income that'd be worth over $10,000 for each person today. Friedman explained, ""We should replace the rag-bag of specific welfare programs with a single comprehensive program of income supplements in cash, and do more efficiently and humanely what our present system does so inefficiently and inhumanely."" John Kenneth Galbraith and a thousand other economists echoed Friedman. They wrote, ""The answer for poverty is pretty clear. Everyone should be guaranteed a decent basic income."" And only a year earlier, Martin Luther King had condemned President Johnson’s piecemeal approach to the war on poverty, saying, ""I'm now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective. The solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by the guaranteed income."" He said, ""The dignity of the individual flourished when decisions concerning his life are in his own hands."" With so many people living in poverty, despite over 100 cash transfer programs, and the inhumanity of today's bureaucracy would be reason enough to institute a basic income as the new safety net. But there are two more even compelling reasons. First, despite all the touted job growth, and low employment rates, November's election was a shocking warning that the 21st century has gotten off, economically, to a really bad start. 47 percent of Americans couldn't find $400 for an unexpected expense. Nearly half are stuck in jobs that make less than $15 an hour. 40 percent perform unstable contingent work. A 30-year old's chances of earning more than their parents are down 40 percent, and the number of people engaged in any paid employment is at the lowest level in decades. A mere 34 percent of Americans feel financially secure. The rest feel, this is the United States of anxiety. So, secondly, a universal basic income, in this new age of insecurity, could be both a shock absorber and a supplement to work. Finally, accelerating technology may create the greatest disruption to jobs in history, and the Obama administration reports that 83 percent of the jobs paying less than $20 an hour, one-third of the jobs paying $40 an hour -- that's $80,000 a year -- are going to be impacted. Oxford University,:47 percent of all American jobs will be lost. McKinsey: 45 percent of all tasks can be automated. And add to this chorus of disruptive technology the voices of the World Bank, the ILO, Joe Stiglitz, Elon Musk, Robert Reich, and Robin Chase. The first major disruption may actually be self-driving trucks. The largest job in 29 states, employing over 7 million people. Some may argue that we -- Charles and I, the new 21st century Luddites, but as the chair of the Bank of England makes clear, every technological revolution -- every single one, mercilessly destroys jobs well before the new ones emerge. So, how could a basic income work after a possible phase-in? I propose that every citizen, 18 to 64, would have electronically deposited into their account a thousand dollars a month. That's $12,000 a year. No strings attached. It's that simple. According to government statistics that $12,000 ends poverty for the first time for 43 million people. It would allow entrepreneurs to start a business, women to escape domestic violence, or finally be compensated for their care giving jobs. Workers could be retrained or not accept poorly paid or irregularly scheduled work. Students could pay for books and fees while prisoners could survive once released. And if these payments only go to citizens 18 to 64 and seniors receiving less than $1,000 a month in Social Security, then by a combination of eliminating current welfare programs, not all but some, eliminating tax expenditures, not all but some, not health care or not disability benefits, and if we add new revenue whether it be a board or a vat, a carbon, or even Bill Gates robot tax and claw back the money from people at higher incomes, we can afford to do this in America. The universal basic income is supported across the political ideologies because it's a fix -- efficient and flexible and humane and can end poverty once and for all. It promotes choice and freedom and offers security for the first time, both now and during the upcoming disruptive technological challenges we will face. A universal basic income is the safety net of the future and I urge you to vote yes. ",nan
against," So, it's terrific to be here today and I'm particularly pleased to be in dialogue and debate with people who, especially in Andy's case, I very much share their goals and I share much of their diagnosis of the problem. I don't want to be here as the defender of the status quo, tell you everything's perfect in our economy, or that all of our public programs are working. Certainly, we need improvements; certainly, we need reforms. The argument that Jared and I are going to make is that universal basic income is based on a faulty premise, would take us in the wrong direction, and would make many of the problems that Andy is so rightly worried about even worse. Let me begin with the premise. Much of the premise for universal basic income is the notion that robots will take all of our jobs, and that if we can't be employed, that we'll need something else, some money from the government to take care of us. People have thought this for a really long time. In the 19th Century, 70 percent of our population worked on farms making the food that we needed to eat. If you had told them that almost 150 years later, almost all of them would not need to work on the farms, less than 2 percent of our population could feed us, they would've wondered where all the jobs could come from. Today, machines do 90 percent of what workers could do 100 years ago, and yet the unemployment rate is a little bit below 5 percent just like the employment rate was in the year 1900. Switzerland has a much higher employment rate than Italy. That isn't because there's lots of robots in Italy doing everyone's job and Switzerland people build the cuckoo clocks by hand. As people get richer, it creates new jobs that you never could've imagined in the 19th Century. It makes people want to spend more and support even more jobs, and consistently people have said just around the corner there's going to be a disruption and yet we're currently in the longest streak of job creation that we've ever seen in this country's history. Second, regardless of your views on this question of the future of work, the numbers in the UBI proposals tend to sound really, really attractive. They just have one downside. They violate the laws of arithmetic. Do not accept this idea unless you understand what the tradeoffs are. It's really quite simple. If you give somebody a dollar, that dollar has to come from somewhere. It has to come from cutting benefits that someone is getting or raising taxes on someone. Now, maybe we’ll hear a little bit about all the bureaucracy that administers all these programs, but you could get rid of all that bureaucracy for unemployment insurance, food stamps, housing vouchers and the like, and only have $150 per person for UBI. So, if you want $10,000, you need to find the other $9,850. To put some scales on these proposals, Andy’s proposal that he just outlined will cost about $1.8 trillion. Charles has a proposal that’s a bit different that would also cost about $1.8 trillion. That’s twice what we spend on Social Security, our largest government program right now. That is more than we collect in income taxes every year. So, you would have to double your income taxes. You would have to eliminate Social Security twice, or if you’re not touching Social Security, take all of the income support programs -- there’s 300 billion of them a year -- you can’t pay for $1.8 trillion for $300 billion a year. So, if you are tempted to support this motion, make sure you understand who the losers are, because you’re redistributing money that creates an equal number of winners as it does losers, because it’s just a dollar from here needs to come from there. In most of the proposals, the losers tend to be households with more children lose -- get a cut relative to a household without children, because today we support you based on your number or children. Or, older households, in Charles’ plan, a 90-year-old would lose relative to a 45-year-old, who would gain. Or, somebody who’s unemployed, which is something we support quite strongly now with unemployment insurance, would lose, and somebody who is employed and went to college would gain. Or, somebody who makes $90,000 a year would win. They would get a better deal than they get today. And somebody who makes $30,000 a year would lose. Again, these details can change. We’re going to hear this isn’t true because of that. That’s not true because of that. But unless you’ve heard who’s winning, who’s losing and you understand the rationale for it, you shouldn’t support the motion. The final thing I would say is, we do need changes in our programs. We need to build on what works. We need to end what doesn’t work. And in particular, we need to support and encourage work, because while there will be jobs in the future, I don’t think it’s automatic that people can get them, and helping connect people to jobs, helping them work, helping fulfill their meaning and get an income is the most important thing for us to do. ",1.0
for,"I’m going to engage along with Andy during the discussion period of a lot of the issues that Jason just raised, but I want to spend my time talking about some of the things that would be accomplished if we had a universal basic income. If we’ve learned anything over the last couple of years, and especially in 2016, it is that the working class in this country has a lot of problems. They are not just in urban areas, they’re not limited to any one race, they’re all over the country. And these problems are ones that I think a UBI can deal with as the current system cannot possibly deal with. And I want to start out with the example of people who are doing everything right but are low-income. Let’s say we’re talking about a married couple with children. They’re near the minimum wage. Let’s say they each bring in $14,000 a year. That’s $28,000 for the two of them. They’re good parents. They are good neighbors. But they’re also just scraping by. Under the current system, do they get any welfare benefits? Yeah, they do. But at $28,000, a lot of those have been phased out, and also depends where you live in the country is what the other benefits are, and a lot of those benefits are in-kind benefits, as opposed to cash. In the case of Andy’s plan -- which, by the way, for purposes of this debate, we’re going with Andy’s plan, both of us are. In terms of Andy’s plan, this couple now has $52,000 per year cash. That means that they are no longer having to rent a place which has Section 8 housing. They can go out and buy -- rent an apartment anywhere they want to that they can afford. It means that they are not giving out food stamps to the cashier at the grocery store. They're pulling cash out of their pocket. It means that they are not supplicating the welfare bureaucracy to please enroll them in this program, and please don't kick them off that program. They are able to have a qualitatively different life. In material terms, yes, but also in terms of the independence and options. They are moving toward -- basically approaching a middle-class income. There are millions of such people in this country. They deserve to have that kind of life. We can afford to give it to them, and just doing that alone would be great. Now let me sort of go to the other extreme, and the ways in which a universal basic income gives moral agency, whether people want it or not. Let's think of the guy who is your complete screw-up. He drinks too much, he can't hold on to a job, and he runs out of money 10 days before the end of the month. Well, under the UBI, he can no longer plead helplessness. His friends and his relatives can say to him, as they cannot say now, ""Okay, we aren't going to let you starve,"" but ""You've got to get your act together, and don't tell us there's nothing you can do, because we know you've got a thousand bucks hitting your bank account next month. You got -- you've got to start dealing with your problems."" That's good. That kind of interaction, multiplied millions of times around the country, is having friends and relatives deal with human needs in ways that bureaucracies inherently are unable to deal with them. You have a situation whereby a guy who is living with his girlfriend is suddenly told, when the UBI is in effect, he's got to start paying part of the rent. Well, that's good for him, and it's good for her. You have other guys who have fathered children and walked away from them, and we really can't do much about it now with our child support laws, because the guy could say, ""I don't have any money."" Well, under the UBI, guess what? That money is deducted by court order before he ever sees it, as it goes into the account. That's good for the child. That's good for the mother, and that's good for the guy, and it's really good for all the guy's friends, who take notice of what's going on. But I don't want to go too far with getting people to shape up, giving people moral agency -- because they do, in fact, have resources and can take on responsibility. I really want to focus and elaborate in the rest of the debate on all the ways in which the UBI gives people options. So, let's go back to marriage again. You have the guy making $14,000 a year. He wants to marry his girlfriend. Getting married with that little money is a problem. Now, with the UBI, they will have a family income of $39,000, if I'm -- 39, 38, I have to add it up -- even if his wife does not work at all. That makes marriage a possibility in a way it wasn't before. Or think of a woman who's married to a guy and they have a joint income. They both work, and they earn 60 or $70,000 a year. They're middle class, but she can't afford to do what she wants to do when she has a baby, which is to spend a couple of years with the baby. An awful lot of affluent women on the Upper West Side of New York who can make that choice and who have careers choose to stay at home with their children, which is good for the child. It's good for the mother. It's good for the dad. It's good for everybody. It's good for the community. Well, let's give middle-class women the kind of economic buffer whereby they can do the same thing. In all of these ways, we have possibilities with the universal basic income, of augmenting incomes by dollar amounts, yes, but what we are really augmenting is options. We are augmenting dignity, we are augmenting independence. We are augmenting human flourishing. I hope you will agree, these are goals that not only deserve our economic support, but our enthusiastic moral support. ",1.0
against,"  So, Jason started somewhere around 1800. I'm going to start by taking you back just about a decade ago, when the two of us were working for a new historic presidential administration. That was very exciting. In the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, that part was horrifying. These days, in a fact that poses a challenge to our opponent's end of work hypothesis, we're adding an average of 200,000 jobs per month, but back then we were shedding 700,000 jobs per month, over two million jobs lost in the first quarter. Why am I telling you about this? Because that recession threw 14 million additional people into poverty, 14 million people ended up poor. That's 5.5 million more people who lived -- than live in New York City. This was between 2007 and 2010. But -- and here's the first point I want to impart to you, once you account for the anti-poverty programs -- programs that lifted their income, their wages, that provided them with extra nutrition, with housing and with health care, the number of poor remained essentially flat. Even amidst the worst recession, I hope of any of our lifetimes, once you account for these interventions, poverty was essentially unchanged, even in the midst of the Great Recession. Now, the reason I'm underscoring this is if our opponent's UBI proposals had been in place this would not have occurred. And that's for one of two reasons. Either, the resources that we're now using to support anti-poverty programs would be diluted as in Charles' plan, that's the universal part, or if you envision that we're somehow going to provide with a UBI on top of what we're now providing for them, you run head on into the constraints that Jason raised. The idea that you'd be spending the full amount of what our tax system already collects every year. The tax system needed to support a program that keeps the current safety net in place and builds a UBI on top of that is not one we should consider realistic, even in the context of this debate where I think we usefully suspend political disbelief to have a discussion in the age of Trump when conservatives are falling all over each other to cut taxes on rich people and cut spending for poor people. Resource constraints exist even in that world, and a dollar going to someone who doesn't really need it is a dollar that isn't going to someone who really does. Now, of course, UBI supporters from the right argue that the help that we're providing to poor and elderly people today, doesn't work. From Ronald Reagan to Paul Ryan, they say we fought a war on poverty and poverty won. Charles writes in his book, ""The welfare state produces its own destruction."" But these claims are false. Back when Reagan first made that claim, the safety net listed 4 percent of the poor out of poverty. Today, it lifts 40 percent, more than 40 percent out of poverty, a 10-fold increase. Today, our anti-poverty programs, which UBI proposals, both those of Andy and Charles, would wholly or partially end lift 40 million people out of poverty, including eight million kids and 18 million elderly persons. And in a deep and important contradiction to this claim of the welfare system self-destructing, we now have long-term research that shows that for children who benefit from poverty reduction, the benefits are long lasting. Poverty reduction that UBI would I fear undermine. Kids who get nutritional support were less likely to be obese, to have heart disease, to drop out of high school compared to kids who didn't. The Medicaid expansion was also -- kids who benefited from the Medicaid expansion were less likely to drop out and more likely to finish college. A dollar spent on early childhood education results in roughly $8.60 of benefits to society, about half of which comes from increased earnings for children when they grow up. Now, those who know my work, and I hope some of you do, know that I spend a lot more time thinking about ways to improve this system I'm describing to you than I do touting and defending it. After all, even with all of the poverty reduction I've described, poverty rates are far too high. So, my work typically focuses on expanding the earned income tax credit and nutritional support. I’d seriously boost these upward mobility enhancers like quality preschool for little kids and college access for big kids. I'd make sure that unemployment insurance helps people longer, especially in places that get especially hard hit in recessions. I wouldn't guarantee everybody a basic income. I'd guarantee low and moderate income people a job. But if we instead choose to use our resources on people who don't need them, we won't be able to build on the progress we've made. Again, I understand and appreciate the usefulness of constraining political reality for this debate. But let me end my initial comments by relaxing that constraint, because there's little point in totally abstracting from reality. You know, Bob Greenstein, a poverty expert with whom I work, said any possibility of overcoming the obstacles to UBI will require a left-right coalition that has significant conservative support, and conservative support for UBI rests on an approach that will increase poverty rather than reduce it. I just don’t see how you implement the program, some aspects of which I like, that our opponents are touting without seriously hurting the poor. There’s no way to add a program closer to Andy’s, as he recognizes, without seriously raising taxes. And I’ve been in D.C. for almost 30 years and not only have I seen total unified resistance to tax increases among Republicans, I’ve seen too many Democrats buy into that as well. Unless our nation’s politics radically change, I’m sure the answer is the worst-case scenario. A UBI may well hurt the people who need help the most. ",1.0
against,"Somebody wrote a book, a guy, Martin Ford called “Rise of the Robots” that made this prediction. The Wall Street Journal, in 1960, had an article with the headline “The Robots Rise” that made exactly the same prediction 55 years ago. People have been predicting this for a really long time. There is no evidence for it in the data. The fraction of the population that works varies a lot across countries and across times, but it depends on economic circumstances and what you’re doing to help prepare people for jobs and succeed in jobs, not on the number of robots you have. So, rather than treating this as inevitable and declaring -- surrendering to the robots, we should be figuring out how people can succeed, thrive and work in an era when, yes, we hopefully will have more robots doing more of the things that they’re better at than humans. Freeing us up for other, even better jobs.",2.0

You know, the problem with economists are, they try to predict the future by looking at data from the past. And I think we just had an election where people used a lot of data from the past and kind of missed the point -- because things actually do change in this world. And there was a headline one time that Donald Trump would be president, you know, and everybody laughed at that as well, and now we have him as the President of the United States. So, let's not say because the data once happened or -- it will never happen again. Let's look at this. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking -- people that are creating the future, all will tell you this is an event that will occur within the next 20 years. Not obsolescence. And it's not just robots. It's software that's enabled globalization. It's autonomous vehicles that allow for self-driving trucks. It's the Amazon new checkout which is like EZ-Pass, where you walk out the door and all the things are accounted for. The studies by Boston Consulting, the World Bank, the ILO, you know, The European Union all say there will be a massive disruption in jobs.

What I would say is, I'd encourage the audience to think in a commonsensical way about this. Look around. Do you really see -- I happened to walk up here from Penn Station today. There's a lot of work going on in New York, let me tell you. Do you -- look around. And not just in New York, but throughout the country. Do you really see the end of work? I see a lot of work that needs to be done, in transportation, in infrastructure, in childcare -- where people, not robots, are so important -- in teaching -- where people, not robots, must do the work -- in elder care.  And if we're smart, in areas like renewable energy, where I believe there is serious and deep employment possibilities.

Whereby artificial intelligence is enabling software to do things that would be considered 10 years away just a year ago, such as, for example, becoming the best Go player in the world because the software taught itself how to play Go. I think something I want to add onto Andy's point is it's not just the working-class jobs that are going to get displaced. The really great hollowing out of jobs is going to be in white collar jobs -- in accountancy, in all sorts of legal -- paralegal work, in all sorts of things where you used to make a good salary because you had to be pretty bright to do it. You had to make judgments. And guess what? At this point, the judgments made by the software, in many cases, are better than the judgments made by the employees.

The New York Times had a good write-up of a study, I think, from McKinsey, recently. There's all this talk that AI can do all the discovery for us, so that's going to replace lawyers. Well, lawyers also appear in courtrooms. Lawyers talk to their clients. Lawyers negotiate things. AI can't do any of those activities. And when people have looked at it carefully in that study, they found that these AI’s are replacing about 2 percent of what lawyers do per year, which means 98 percent it's not replacing.

That is the problem with the U -- the universal of universal basic income. I mean, their plan gives $12,000 a year to Bill Gates, to Warren Buffett, and they don't need it. And, in fact, Andy talked about the EITC. That's a really important wage subsidy for low-income people, lifts 10 million people out of poverty every year. He takes the EITC and he takes food stamps and he puts that into the UBI and dilutes that anti-poverty effectiveness, and that to me is the core problem here, because it's not just that the UBI is going to people who don't need it, it's that you're undermining some poverty reduction -- -- effects that are working today.",2.0

They would lose that, with the money saved from losing that going to pay someone at 50,000, 100,000, a million, $10 million a year. If we got additional revenue, there’s a lot of places to invest it.

So, I just don’t understand the arithmetic that you’re talking about. And secondly, the programs that I mentioned -- the benefits from nutritional support, the benefits from medical support, the benefits from Head Start, the benefits from Pell -- these are long-lasting benefits. If you take that away and you give people a few thousand bucks, in the long run, I’m afraid they’d be worse off. So, I don’t understand how you pile more money --",2.0

One is, can we afford the program, and the second one was, will people at low-income levels be better off. The people who get the most money in terms of the size of the benefits are single women with children. And under the additional $12,000, which Medicaid is still being provided under Andy’s plan -- the numbers add up to about the same. They are not winners or losers in this calculation. But in terms of all the other low-income people, the ones who are making 15,000, $20,000 a year, particularly a couple, an additional $24,000 onto their income, they are way better off. So, if you want to say we can’t afford it, let’s engage in that debate. I’ll be glad to do it. But the idea that, oh, that they’re going to lose their food stamps, they’re going to lose their EITC, well, the $12,000 for most low-income Americans is way more than they are getting on those benefits.",2.0
against,"So, first, two things. One is, that’s actually factually inaccurate and that in certain circumstances you actually are getting more benefits today, and the reason is because those bureaucrats making people jump through hoops we’ve seen denigrated so much, do things like on your tax form you will out the number of children you have and you get a larger EITC if you’re in a family with three or more children than a family with one children. That's one of the things those bureaucrats do, and that, by the way, was partly my fault. We put that in during the Obama administration. Another thing those bureaucrats do is unemployment insurance. They make sure you're unemployed, and really importantly, they make sure you're looking for a job. The evidence is, that actually, when you put a bit more funding into the part where they screen you to check whether you're really looking for a job -- something conservatives have supported because it's a form of program integrity to keep people committing fraud off of it -- it actually helps more people look for jobs and find jobs.

We're going to force the people on Medicaid to work. You know, this is not a very benign welfare system, and Martin Luther King had it right. You know, putting people's choices in their own hands is the greatest dignity you can give someone. And asking some bureaucrat to fill out their form, you know, is not the kind of dignity we need if we have another choice.",2.0

The problem is this income constraint that you're just not dealing with. Your example before -- and it's easy to get tangled up in this -- really sounded like you're going to take everybody's benefits away because you're going to combine them into a UBI, and then you're going to give them back to them in the form of a UBI. So, they're no better off except for the fact -- and here you have a point -- that they have cash now instead of having to go through a set of programs. But -- recognize -- but -- no, hold on. This is key. Recognize that you can't do that if you're taking a big chunk of resources that you're now giving to low-income people, and giving it to high-income people.

We know how to calibrate this and calibrate that, but we can't just give people money. That's too simple. And it's much better if we do all of these smart things that we know how to do. And you got Andy over here, and I, saying, ""Give them the damn money and let them decide how they want to live their lives."" And get out of their way. I -- I responded -- Okay. So, one-tenth of 1 percent -- which is $62 million -- pay the same tax rate as the people in the 20 percent bracket. 17 percent of the income is paid by the richest people that get 27 percent of the tax expenditures. Why don't -- they're getting money every single way. So, all of a sudden, we want to give money to poor people, and we can't do it, because somehow, we're giving too much money to rich people. We have a distribution problem. The tax system favors the wealthy, and we are going to have to do something about it. And putting this on the back of UBI’s -- Bill Gates' $12,000 is a pittance compared to what he's getting in every other tax expenditure that we should be talking about as well. I very much believe in dignity. Your EITC is -- -- incredibly easy thing to claim. You can spend that money on whatever you wanted on. Most of the hoops we've heard about, the drug testing, the limits on what you can do, have been put in place over the years by conservatives in the name of their notion of dignity. I think they've been misguided and I would reform those programs, simplify, and streamline them, that maybe even move towards cash. That's different, though, then universal. For universal, we have to talk about where the money is coming from and how we want to spend that amount of money, which hopefully we'll get to. Really quickly, I'm saying that the kinds of human needs that we need to deal with are best dealt with by friends and relatives and that the UBI, one of its major effects, is to focus resources on the community. The key to understanding the UBI is not that I get $12,000, but everybody else is getting the $12,000 and everybody knows it.

But that there are many ways in which I think you don't -- that people don't appreciate, Charles doesn't appreciate, in which these things are working.

I've read all of his books and many of them are erudite, some of them less so. But I will say that his version of civil society is not the same as mine and I suspect not the same as a lot of people's out there. And when he starts talking about friends and relatives will do that maybe he's right, but that's just a fantasy. What I'm telling you about is that in reality, there's a set of things that are working to help people right now. They're not perfect.

against,"So, some of this is about -- but first of all, the taxes, by the way, just to do the magnitude of them, to pay for them is going to be $1.5 trillion per year. That would be nearly as much as we collect in income taxes today. For higher taxes, there’s a lot of things I’d do with higher taxes. No one is going to support doubling the income taxes people say today. Certainly, not Charles’ friends who are all invested in human freedom, dignity and a tax increase one-tenth the magnitude that we’re talking about here describe it in apocalyptic terms as the end of America. On defense spending, to some degree I agree with you, that I could see arguments for lower defense spending. Then the question is, what do you think the best use of that money is? Is it a check for someone making $60,000 a year, or is it universal preschool? Universal pre-school, certainly it has more bureaucrats. It has requirements. For example, you need to go to school to benefit from universal preschool. I don’t mind that requirement. So, this just isn’t in the first claim on my money. Now, if it’s for people in poverty, sure, that’s great. But all this plan does, at best, seems to be to replace what those people are getting today. So, no, I wouldn’t get rid of defense to replace what people are getting from poverty programs today, give money to someone $80,000, and continue to be one of the worst countries in the OECD when it comes to the percentage of our population that goes to preschool.",2.0

And so, you have to think about biggest bang for the buck. What you just described isn’t going to raise $1.8 trillion, so it’s not going to pay for what they’ve described.

for,"Well, I think that if we’re going to talk about budgets, we’d better look at trendlines, because I think the statement is the safety net of the future, and if you play out the trendlines for the cost of Social Security and welfare programs -- I’ll tell you what happened when I did the book, “In Our Hands” back in 2006. I calculated the cost of my plan and the amount of money we were spending on transfers, and I said the lines would cross between the costs of the programs in 2011, which they did. The point is right now, that a basic income you can predict demographically pretty much exactly what it’s going to cost you, and it’s going to be a very shallow slope. What we’re looking at with the other entitlement programs are very steep rises. So, if you’re talking about the affordability of this today, you’ve got one set of issues. If you’re talking about the affordability of this in 2030, you’ve got a very different situation. Well, I think the good thing about having $12,000 is you basically have your own strike fund. You know, right now, if you're desperate for work, if you only have $400 -- don't have $400 for unexpected expense, and someone offers you a job, you have not much choice but to take it. But to have walk-away money, to have an ability to say ""No,"" you know, gives you a series of choices -- to start a business, to do things that people can't even dream of doing to now, I think, you know, gives people agency, gives them freedom, gives them choice, gives them the same rights that the rich kids do who live in garages in Silicon Valley because someone is giving them a parental basic income. It gives everybody a basic income to do what they need to do. The parental basic income is -- listen. How many of you in this audience are like me -- -- who help your kid go on vacation, who help your kid -- -- you know, pay their auto insurance, or help them put a down payment on a home?

Put them not into a guaranteed income for everybody -- so you end up with the waste problem we've described -- but into a guaranteed job. Boy, that's way more than a strike fund. That's actually a job, and I would insist that this is a job that pays a living wage, because I believe there's lots of work to be done, and I described it. I'm happy to describe it again. That's where I would go with this -- a guaranteed job for low-income people. Anyone who's able-bodied, wants to work, can work -- and that we could pay for on the kinds of numbers that we're throwing around now. That doesn't cost the same amount as a UBI, because it doesn't waste its resources on people who don't need it. Yeah, we believe that. Is it okay to count people that aren't in the United States? I spent six years in Thailand, mostly in subsistence level villages, so I spent all of my time with poor people there. During the 1970s, I worked on programs -- social programs, evaluation of them, where I spent a lot of time in South Side Chicago, inner city Atlanta, et cetera.  You know, I spent my entire life with janitors, child care, home care, food service, security workers, and welfare workers, in fact. And so, my whole life is somewhat informed.

It was like a gold card. Same thing with helping her -- when I helped her get her kid into a preschool program. Same thing when I helped -- when she eventually got a job, and I helped her get an earned income credit. I'm not saying I did anything good. I'm advertising for these pieces that were on the table.

In Alaska, instead of giving everybody a new welfare program that Jason and Jared would redesign, you know, they decided just to give people $1,300 -- they give people money from the oil reserves directly to people and they have a trust and every month -- every year, I'm sorry, people get something between $1,000 and $2,000 in a year. So, that was a different way to -- you know, to give people money and there and the other experiments -- we did five experiments in the United States about universal basic income during Richard Nixon's time.

That being said, if you look at many of the UBI proposals they don't have that feature. So, for example, they index to inflation, but they get rid of health care. You're supposed to buy it out of your UBI. The cost of health care rises faster than inflation. That's precisely what we see the Republicans doing right now with their vote tomorrow in Congress. They take Medicaid and replace it with something that grows over time, but it grows at a smaller rate. You have to look at the details of these things and I worry that a lot of them by taking away natural ways, you know, going up -- food stamps go up with the cost of food. The cost of food goes up, they go up automatically. Anything and this is going to automatically go up with the cost of food.

And so, I think from a political point of view the reason we failed over and over and over again to improve the welfare programs is because we divide the population into the people that deserve it and the people that don’t, even though the -- you know, you can argue that till the day is long, but that’s exactly reverse. So, I would say to build the political calculus -- as we’ve done with Social Security and Medicare -- that makes this an enduring program is not to make one group of people stand out and be vulnerable to be cut, but to give it to everyone and use the tax system, which is how we claw back money from people who have money rather than trying to do this all through a welfare system, which has not worked up to now. Yeah, I mean, I would never do this unless it was all done in one single package. It’s kind of like repeal and replace, you know? I’m not doing the repeal without the replace. And I think this true here. You have to have, as we did with the Obamacare, you have to have a full package. And we know that nothing is perfect and people will argue around the edges, but in the end, we did increase healthcare for 20 million people. In the end, UBI will relieve poverty for 43 million people. Well, the problem with experiments is that a great deal of the effect of the UBI depends on the knowledge it will be permanent and you can think ahead. If you know that you’re in a five-year experiment, your whole calculus changes, and so that’s why I really don’t -- I don’t think that there is a good set of conclusions we can draw from even an ideal experiment that we set up. If you know that for the rest of your life you are going to have this resource available to you on the first of every month, it’s not just your own decisions that have changed. It is also your interactions with the people around you that have changed. So, have not got any hard numbers on that, have not got any hard data on that. Well, that’s an interesting observation.",2.0

Look, I'm -- as I think I've suggested in some other answers, I would raise the funds needed to do the kinds of improvements that we think are so necessary for more progressive taxation.

So, I like looking for where there -- I'd like to look for where there's some -- maybe some wiggle room in the spending side of the budget. But primarily, we're -- we are -- and Andy said this earlier. We're collecting a share of their income -- far less revenue from the very wealthy than we have throughout the history of our country. It's this inequality problem -- and it's compounded by the fact that the wealthy are able to kind of buy, through money and politics, a kind of tax policy that protects them, that insulates them from more progressive changes.

And although I wish I can go back and change what happened when Martin Luther King and Richard Nixon all were for a guaranteed income, I can't, but we can go forward in a way that gives people the dignity and the choice, that gives the warehouse workers at Amazon, or gives the truck drivers, or the insurance agency accountants some sense that their future will be secure. Our choice, according to the thousand experts at Pew Research, is this, either we're going to do something or we're going to see vast increases in inequality, masses who are effectively unemployable, and breakdowns in the social order. That's not the America we want. A universal basic income is flexible. It's humane. It ends poverty. It offers choices and stability now and as we transition to a new economy. It's the one comprehensive policy that has support from both the left and right. UBI has issues. I admit it. No single policy is going to ever solve every single problem, but I remember what Winston Churchill once said about democracy. ""It's the worst form of government except for all others."" And I would like to say UBI as a policy, is exactly the same. It is far superior for all the other choices we have. Our future, our family's futures, is not a matter of chance.

I get that it’s easier to write a check for everyone, including those who don’t need the money, than to do the heavy policy lifting that can break down the barriers that so many people face today. I wish I could do that with a UBI check, with a thousand dollars a month to buy the dreams that Charles talked about, but they’re more expensive than that. By providing everyone with that kind of income, you‘re not going to come anywhere close to ensuring secure housing, adequate nutrition, access to quality childcare, educational opportunities from pre-school to grade school to college and beyond, and decent job that pays a living wage. What’s more, we’ve made real progress against every one of those barriers -- not enough by a long shot -- and the next four years -- please God make them just four years -- will be pure defense, pure defense trying to protect the progress that we’ve made.
