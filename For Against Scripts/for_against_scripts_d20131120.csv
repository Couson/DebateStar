for,"Thank you very much, John. Thank you all for coming. These issues we're debating tonight are difficult and very complex. They engage some of the most fundamental issues in American public life: Liberty, security, technology, democracy. And there really are no simple answers to this. We'll do our best to distill it, but let me just say, anyone who's worked in these issues in a practical way knows how hard they are and that they do need to be very carefully weighed and not handled impulsively or ideologically. I'm going to make three points in this opening statement. The programs that we're going to talk about tonight really do matter for security. And for me, having been deputy commissioner of counterterrorism at the NYPD and then three different jobs in the White House before, during and after 9/11, I can really tell you this on a first hand basis.And we may get into some of the details of how this works, how these sorts of systems lead to the original lead that then leads to the unraveling of a plot and the saving of lives. It is not abstract. It is real no kidding lives at stake sort of business. I don't want to hyperventilate about it, but I've lived through enough of them to be able to recount some of the direct experiences. And if that comes up in a Q&A, we'll have to go through them in greater detail. But they really do matter. Turns out a terrorist plot is not that difficult to stop if you know about it, and finding out about it in the first place is by far the hardest step in the process. In the overwhelming number of incidents that we've had since 9/11, that original lead, what's called the ""predication for further investigative steps,"" has come from electronic surveillance of one form or another, so these programs really do matter. Second, and what I'm about to say I think is going to unite both sides of this debate. Stewart and I have worked on these issues for a while. We are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms of electronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the Constitution, by statute, and by court interpretation are permissible, so don't for a second think that Stewart and I are arguing for anything that is illegal. And since the other side I think is very likely not to argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, I think this is something that brings us together. We are for lawful forms of surveillance. And there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems can be deployed. And this is not a legal seminar, but I can tell you that, that system has evolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of an enormous success for the American privacy and civil liberties community. It's hard to believe, but it's a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and no jurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. It was unfettered. Now it's fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with -- and an act of 1978, and then adjusted in important ways with the FISA Modernization Acts of the last five years. And so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind of broader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and these sorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were not previously. Previously -- if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powers of the president under the Constitution, Article 2 that permitted him to do this. And those days are over. Now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, and the court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within thedomain of the president. There are now checks and balances on his power to do that, and that is extraordinary progress. And the third thing I want to say is how unusual this area is in Washington. As I said, there's partisan gridlock in here. Name me another issue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in the Middle East, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program. It's remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in the case of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisan transition. So these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of the Bush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the Obama administration, two leaders who could not be more different. And they are unchanged. And so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argument because you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress, the two presidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberal and quite educated in Constitutional law -- he taught it, University of Chicago -- and the judiciary all backing up and saying it's fine. So what the other side has to do, and it's a tough burden I think, is say, ""They've all got it wrong, we've got it right, we know better.” And I think frankly that's a pretty high burden for them. Thank you very much.",
for,"That'll be fine. Thanks, John. Mike German has put the problem, I think, as directly as it could be. When, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to gather data on large populations, everybody in order to make us more safe? So that's the question. You can call it spying on everybody, if you like, and he does. But it's not as unusual or as ineffective, and certainly not illegal as he suggests. And I'll take his challenge of saying, ""When has spying on everybody -- when has gathering all of the data on everybody, innocent or not, helped us stop terrorist attacks?"" and let's take the Zazi case, the Times Square bombing case, the Underwear Bomber.When I was at DHS, one of the things we fought very hard to do was something that I think Mike German would call spying on everyone. We said we want the airlines to give us the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who's flying into the United States; everybody, not just the suspects. We need to know who's coming here. We use that data to compare the names and the information that was on there to the databases in which we had information about people we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about. And then when those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spending about 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the United States, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat. That was a routine practice. And most of us just, you know, it's welcome home, and you move on. But a few people, they couldn't stop everybody, but they could stop a few people. They used this data to decide who was worth worrying about. Now, let's take the Underwear Bomber. The people who did airport security had no information about him. And not surprisingly, didn't check in very carefully, and he got right past them. It turned out that when he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who had access to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, were able to identify as somebody that they were worried about. So he would have been caught if we'd had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when he landed. That's, indeed, probably why al-Qaeda wanted to blow up the plane before he had to get past the customs officials. The same thing is true for the Times Square Bomber, where after the bombing, the FBI got a phone number. They asked our guys, do you have that phone number? Did anybody with that phone number come into the United States? Turned out that he'd given that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data. The department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt. And then he got on the plane and was about to leave the country. The only reason we caught him is because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were able to run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we're looking for. He's on the plane. That plane had already closed its doors when the customs officials went on to pull him off. He would have gotten away, but for the data which Mike German calls, ""Spying on everybody.” I would call it ""gathering data that is alreadyin the hands of third parties,"" given it to the airlines, they're going to use it to decide whether you get chicken or tornadoes, and whether you get that 3 inches of extra leg room. You know, I'm happy to have that information also used to make sure I actually arrive at my destination. And it seems to me that the intrusion -- you can call a lot of scary things, but the fact is, at the end of the day, it's information that I willingly shared with the airlines, and I'm happy that they're using it to protect me as well. That's the real question we have here, is, can we use data that we've given to a third party, can the government use data that you've given to a third party, to try to find terrorists? We do that all the time. The NSA program is probably the most aggressive use of that. But at the end of the day, this is billing information you've given -- we've all given to the phone companies. It is searched by law enforcement outside of the NSA program 1.3 million times a year. What the NSA did, at the end of the day, through the program and through the safeguards that they established for that program, they required -- Yes, we gather the information, but no one can search it without articulable, reasonable suspicion passed on by a lawyer. It'll be audited. A limited number of people will have access to it. At the end of the day, 300 numbers went into that on a given year. 500 -- there were searches to find who they were talking to. 500 numbers came out as potentially suspicious. And only then did the government go out to try to find out whose name was associated with those phone numbers. 500 people versus -- and all used for terrorist purposes, all carefully scrubbed versus 1.3 million searches done by law enforcement every day without bringing 1984 home to America. Thank you.",1.0
against,"Thank you. Stewart Baker gave a great defense of the public passenger data program that we've all known about for years, and no one has had any problem with. Of course, that's not what's at issue here. What's at issue here is whether we have a problem with the secret NSA program adopted in secret through secret interpretations of a law whose author said this would never -- he never would have dreamed of authorizing this sort of program, had he known that's what the government was going to do with it. I think that's a very different question. The NSA is collecting information on every time every one of us calls or texts anybody; your son, your daughter, your mother, your doctor, your psychiatrist, your AA mentor, your old girlfriend, your new girlfriend. That's what they're collecting. It's not passenger data about people getting on airplanes. It's literally every phone call. It's doing it in secret, as I said, pursuant to a secret interpretation of a law whose author said this is not consistent with what I understood. And Rich Falkenrath says there's unanimity about this program, I don't think so. There are 30 bills that have been introduced in Congress to try to fix the problem that has now been disclosed not because of openness and checks and balances but because of Edward Snowden leaking it. And this is a program that the NSA lied to Congress to keep secret from us. When the director of National Intelligence, James Clapper , was asked pointblank, ""Are you collecting data on millions of Americans?"" he said -- in Congress, under oath, he said, ""No.” Later he said that was the least untruthful answer he could give. Well, I think I can think of two more truthful answers. One would have been, ""Yes,"" and the other would have been, ""We can't confirm or deny.” But instead he lied to us, lied to us, why, because if we knew that this program was underway, we wouldn't accept it. Mike has suggested reasons why you should vote against this kind of spying, because it doesn't work, doesn't make us safe. I'm going to suggest that you should vote against the program because it violates core principles of a democracy, transparency, and privacy. A healthy democracy demands transparency from the government and privacy for the citizens, but it seems that today we have reversed that, with the government demanding transparency from us but insisting on secrecy with respect to the programs that it employs. We should be concerned about this because of the problems that secrecy poses to a democracy. Of course there's a role for secrecy in terms of national security, but there's also a role for democracy. And when you have an agency engaging in conduct that the person who passed the law says is totally inconsistent with the law he passed and doing it in secret and lying about it, you have a problem with democracy. National security is a compelling state interest, and it is justifiable to engage in surveillance of a range of kinds in order to keep us safe. But we have a right to have a say in how far the government goes in spying on us and our daughters and our sons and our mothers, et cetera. And we were denied that, say, and denied it in the worst possible way, through secrecy and lies. We should also be concerned about the program because it invades our privacy. Privacy is critical. It's essential to human development. It's essential to intimate relations. It's essential to political freedom. People can't speak freely when they fear that the government may well be listening in. Now, some people say, ""Well, you know, if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear.” But I think most of us have nothing to hide but most of us nonetheless close the door to our bedrooms, close the door to our house, put password protections on our computers. Some of us limit who can be friends with us on Facebook. We seal the envelopes that we mail. We believe in maintaining privacy because it's central to human existence. And it's particularly essential to a robust democracy that people have the privacy to engage in political discussion without fear that the government's going to be coming in and invading that privacy. Stewart suggests, ""Well, some -- if Verizon has it, why should we be concerned if the government gets it?"" Well, I think there are a number of reasons we should be concerned. First of all, Verizon doesn't collect this data on every person and hold it for five years as the NSA is doing. That's precisely why the NSA is demanding it, because Verizon just gets it, looks at it for billing records, and then gets rid of it. Second, Verizon doesn't have the power to lock you up, it doesn't have the power to indict you, it doesn't have the power to investigate you for tax evasion because it doesn't like your politics, which we've seen this government do in the past. The government does have that power. And, third, Verizon doesn't have the incentive to go after its customers in the same way that government unfortunately all too often has an incentive to go after those that are critical of it. And we've seen it -- we saw it in the '60s and '70s with a national security program that ended up focusing on anti-war protesters, Civil War -- I mean civil rights activists, Martin Luther King, and women’s rights activists. So it’s not an abstract concern. =t’s a real concern. So I think because the NSA program turns democracy on its head, demanding that our lives be transparent and insisting on secrecy for the government, you should vote against the motion.",1.0
for,"There’s no doubt that when the government collects data, everybody in the democracy ought to be concerned and want to make sure that it is handled in as privacy-protected a fashion as possible, consistent with actually having it be effective. The difficulty here is -- or the protections here are built in to the back end of the system. That is to say the government has the data, but just because it has it doesn’t mean it’s allowed to look at it. =t’s set up a whole set of rules, court enforced, aggressively audited, limited number of people who can get access to this data, and clear rules for when they can do it. To make it much more like the rules that apply to ordinary searches by law enforcement, which is you have a suspicion, and you ask a question about the person or the -- in this case, the phone number that you have a suspicion about. They don’t have any ability to look at people for -- Yes, absolutely.",2.0
against,"Well, I guess the easy two-word response would be Edward Snowden, right? If this data and all this stuff was so protected and so well regulated and so controlled, how would Edward Snowden have gotten so much access to it? And luckily, because Edward Snowden did get so much access to it, and because we’re still benefiting even this week from information that’s coming forward, what has become clearer and clearer is that the FISA court was being -- that the NSA was misrepresenting the program, =’ll say that in the nicest way. And continually going beyond the scope of the minimization procedures and rules to the extent that in 2011, Judge Bates said it was unconstitutional . I don't trust any system that doesn't have effective public oversight.",2.0
for,"It's worth -- There's a few things that -- neither do Stewart or I. We think it's effective in this case. And you’ve left out a few facts. So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records. First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information. Getting it from the government is not a search. Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently. Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized thisprovision. It's called section 215. It was in the Patriot Act. It amended the FISA court regulation. People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now. 215 was very controversial then. It's still controversial now among the same people. But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place. And every 90 days, they have to do it again.",2.0
against,"Well -- What's that -- the first -- The first thing I'd say is I'm not sure we would be satisfied even if the safeguards were fully credible and followed in every instance. Suppose the government said, ""We're going to put a video camera in each one of your bedrooms. We're going to collect the data from what happens in your bedroom, but we're not going to look at it until we have a really good reason to look at it. Would we say, ""Okay, that's fine. Go ahead. Put the video camera in every one of our --"" so back end safeguards don't answer all of the concerns. To Richard's point about the notion that this information is not protected -- we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to this information. Mike Hayden has said, if they can get all the -- Mike :ayden, the former head of NSA, C=A, has said, “if = can get all of that phone data about who you've called over a period of time, I don't need to listen to what you're saying. I can get such a portrait of who you are that I don't even need the content. This stuff is more private than the content itself.” Well, first of all, Richard's point about the Supreme Court was -- Supreme Court has not found that the safeguards are credible here. What the Supreme Court found was that in the '70s, before Al Gore invented the internet -- -- it found that when you make these phone calls, you don't have an expectation of privacy with respect to the data regarding who you called and how long you called for. Immediately Congress responded and said, yes, we do have an expectation of privacy. And they passed a law that forbade the government from getting it without individualized suspicion. This law, the government has now turned around and perverted, in secret, to get the very information that Congress originally said we shouldn't get, and to get not just the data with respect to one suspect, which is what was at issue in the Supreme Court case in the '70s, but to get every piece of phone data of every one of us every time we make a call.",2.0
for,"Let me try to put this in terms everyone can understand the utility of this. So professor Cole, Mike German, Stewart Baker, John, we're here at the same place, same time, participating in a complex operation. I, in fact, never had a phone call with David Cole or -- nonetheless we're here, doing something relatively complicated. Now, it turns out -- We talked to another person, who is in the audience, and was the coordinator of this. And now, here's -- do you understand why this data matters and why Mike Hayden would say that we want this information where you have no expectation of right to privacy. We talked to the coordinator of this debate, who then put us together, right? That is how plots are unraveled. They find out about one perp. They look at the communications pattern, they identify the network, and they can diffuse the plot. So imagine this was not a debate but a bombing. This is how -- this call record data is how it gets unraveled and stopped. And it's why it matters. And it's not a video camera in the bedroom. That is -- that is not a fair comparison, and I think you know it. This data, for very good reasons, the government and the Congress and the court do not hold that you have the same expectations of the right to privacy as to you do in your bedroom.",2.0
against,"So there's no doubt the FBI has tremendous investigative skills that can be put to place once you know something bad has happened. And I've seen that done on a personal basis. But what we're talking about -- first of all, it was sold as a preventive measure. This is for preventing terrorism, to the for solving a terrorist bombing. So you know, I think that the analysts at the NCTC really say it all. So another I was going to quote.""There are so many databases, people don't even know what buttons to push. They don't know where to get information, or they may even already have it and not know it.” Another said, ""More information isn't necessarily better. Better information is better.” So that's what we have to focus on, how -- how do we let law enforcement have the tools it needs to get the bad guys without impacting the rights of the rest of us? And I think the founders did a pretty good job of setting up a system based on reasonable suspicion and probable cause. Again, there's no transparency. There have been these cases that they say these were solved with this program -- Right. Because -- No, no. and it's also worth noting that Stewart did not say that the NSA data mining program solved any of these. What he said was the passenger data program. When the NSA was asked, point blank, by Congress, and by a friendly member of Congress, can you tell us some terrorist plots that you've stopped by virtue of the NSA data mining program? The call data program, he said, ""Yes, one.” And it was the one that Mike referred to earlier. It was about an $8,000 transmission. And the member of Congress who was friendly tothis, to the program, said, wait a minute, you have cases of violence, right, that you stop, not just transfer of money. And the NSA guy had to say, all right, actually, no.",2.0
for,"Yeah. I -- I have to say, there's a little confusion here. I hear Mike German saying, you know, all of these data collection programs are bad. And I think I hear Professor Cole saying, oh, no, those are all -- spying on us is fine if you're gathering data about travel reservations or border crossings. All of that data isn't the kind of spying on us that we're opposed to. We're opposed to this one program that relates to NSA. And I think that suggests that they really don't have the courage of their convictions, that information that is available to third parties should be used for security purposes. That's the position that we are arguing here. And I think we've done a good job. On the question of whether NSA and its program responds to a very real problem, let's remember how they got started with this program. In the months before 9/11, NSA was listening to communications in Yemen, and they heard calls from an al-Qaeda operative. What they didn't know is that the al-Qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the United States. And those calls were coming from inside the United States, because they had no way to look inside the United States to see where these calls were coming from. If they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the United States at that high rank within al-Qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person. They would have found him, and probably the attack would not have occurred. When you have a failure like that, you ask, what can we do to make sure that never happens again? And this program responds in part to that concern. And I think that's a lesson that is written in blood for the national security agency.",2.0
against,"Again, the public record disputes that. The CIA did know he was in the United States. But the CIA wasn't talking to the NSA or the FBI or customs is a totally different issue than whether they needed to collect the information. There were people in ourintelligence community in both the CIA and NSA who knew they were in the United States.",2.0
for,"A few people here and there, but the NSA did not know because they had no tools to know it, to say, ""Well, if somebody else had done their job perfectly, you wouldn't have needed this program,"" is to say, you know, ""If the world were perfect, we wouldn't need counterterrorism.""",2.0
against,"I think there is. I think -- -- the framers came up with an alternative. It's an alternative that we used for 200+ years. And the alternative says that you respect people's privacy until you have reason to believe that they're engaged in some sort of wrongdoing or that they have some sortof foreign intelligence that you want to get. And the -- but the point is it's individualized suspicion, and once you develop that, then you can tap their phone, then you can search their homes, then you can invade their privacy. What the Fourth Amendment was designed to stop was dragnet surveillance, general search warrants that gave the government the power to just pick up everybody's information in the hope that they'd find a bad guy. Yeah, it's quite possible that they'll find a bad guy if they pick up everybody's information, but the framers said, ""That's not the way we want to strike the balance between liberty and security because that gives up all of our privacy in the hope that it'll make us more secure. And I -- so I think we should stick with the way we've been doing it for 200 years and not let technology and the Internet push us towards dragnet surveillance.",2.0
for,"We have -- -- we have, in fact, stuck with that for information the Supreme Court deems personal privacy information. We just don't for this category of information which you think should be categorized but the rest of the legal system in the United States doesn't.",2.0
against,"Well, but that's actually the problem so if that's --",2.0
for,"your standard still applies to content, right? It still requires particularized approval to get the content. What we're talking about here is information which you or whoever have given to a third party, namely, a telecommunications provider, and that they have in their system to use for their purposes and, as Stewart explained, the government needs for its purposes from time to time. So you're confusing the discussion by suggesting they're the same. These are different categories of information. And while you disagree with how the Supreme Court has ruled this, the entire system is built around this distinction.",2.0
against,"Well, two points on that. First of all --John Donvan: David Cole. -- I'm not the only one who says that this information is -- gives all kinds of private information. Mike Hayden has said that it's more valuable than the content itself in terms of determining what someone's doing. That's number one. Number two, the Supreme Court has actually, in its most recent decision on whether the Fourth Amendment covers GPS monitoring of a car in public, said, ""Absolutely, it does.” And five justices said -- because it involved an invasion of a property right -- but five justices said, ""Because collecting all that information, even though it's in public, about where you go --"" they were collecting where this guy went 24/7 for a month -- and all nine justices said, ""That's an invasion of privacy, that requires Fourth Amendment protection,"" rejecting the very position that Rich Falkenrath is putting forward, that, ""Well, if it's in public, there is no expectation of privacy,"" or, ""If you share it with a third party, there is no expectation of privacy.” The reality is that everything we do today is shared with a third party. Every time you walk anywhere with your phone, you're telling the phone company where you are. Should the government be able to get that without any individualized suspicion?",2.0
for,"And I don't -- can I -- -- a point where I think we do agree, of course the government should wherever possible be put to reasonable suspicion before it looks into individual activities. That is true even of the NSA program which is the one that you have chosen as the poster child for this issue. No one is allowed to search this data without a reasonable articulable suspicion. So the question really boils down to ""Are you allowed to collect it first and put it in the database?"" And, look, the question I thought was an excellent one, ""Why would you do that if there's an alternative?"" and the problem is there's not a good alternative. The alternative would be to leave it with the companies and search it there when we have some reason to be concerned about that individual phone number, but the companiesget rid of that data on their own schedule. They’ve got no obligation to keep it, and they don’t. Second, there are -- we got rid of Ma Bell. There is no one phone company you can go to search. No one computer system. So you would have to try to do this kind of analysis of who’s talking to whom outside the United States and in -- you’d have to go jumping from system to system to system to system. =t’s a nightmare. If you thought the healthcare.gov was bad, building this system would be worse. Making it hard for the mic runner. =t’s a lot of different things, and so = think we’re probably going to refer back to this telephone metadata question, and in that case, it’s true that the scale of it was classified, but it was disclosed to every member of Congress in writing twice, 2009 and 2011, where the administration -- the Department of Justice -- by the way, the Obama Department of Justice -- wrote that this program, which we need you to reauthorize, which they did, broad bipartisan majorities, will entail the collection of substantially every telephone call record in the country. So they were told. Now whether -- Yeah, so Congress -- -- and if they didn’t -- and they kept it secret -- it wasn’t being hidden from them at that stage. You can make an argument about an earlier program up to 2006, but for that program in writing they were told.",2.0
against,"Again, when Ron Wyden asked James Clapper at a hearing, “Are you collecting data on millions of Americans?” he flatly said “no, we’re not.” That he’s talking to Congress, he’s talking on the record, he’s talking to CSPAN, he’s talking to the American people. They are lying to us. And members of Congress, members in the House have complained that the House Intelligence Committee will not give them access to records. You know, the exceptive classification on these programs makes it so that only the member can see it, not the staff who actually have the time to work on these programs, to understand the legality, so it’s not as easy as it looks. John Donvan:So, go ahead, yes?",2.0
for,"I was around for the creation of the legal structure around intelligence, and it was a remarkable achievement for the United States. No other country thought you could do intelligence under law. We set up a program that was designed to prevent the abuses that had occurred in the 60s and 70s, and by and large it has done it. But everyone knows -- everyone here knows you can’t do intelligence in the open because the people you’re trying gather it on will be watching more closely than anyone else to figure out how to defeat it. At some point you have to say, =’ve got to trust somebody. In this case we are trusting 14 judges, two different administrations, committees headed by different parties over almost a decade. At some point, you have to say, yes, I would love it if I could know about this, but I realize that everything I know about Al Qaeda knows about, and I have to trust somebody. =f =’m going to trust both parties and all three branches of government, that’s probably as good as it’s going to get.",2.0
against,"And let me just challenge the idea that this is kept secret so that the terrorist doesn’t know that they’re doing this, because = worked and met a lot of terrorists working with them and every single of them and every single criminal I worked undercover against knew they were -- that they were a terrorist or a criminal. So they knew that there was probable cause to believe that they were a terrorist and criminal, and yet they knew that the Fourth Amendment existed. So they don’t worry about suspicion-less collection, because they know they can get caught up in reasonable suspicion collection, probably cause, proof beyond a reasonable doubt suspicion, right? So this was secret to keep it from us. So we wouldn’t know we were being spied on. I think you have to address the fact that Jim Sensenbrenner, the leading Republican on the judiciary committee who wrote section 215, he says ""this program is beyond anything that I would have ever dreamed of authorizing.” And how can that be if he was read into the program and -- is he lying to us? John Donvan:Okay. Right down in front. Well, one of the major controversial programs was a similar program collecting internet data that ran. That was the whole hospital room confrontation with attorney general -- Well, the risks are that with all of the -- I mean, the same logic that gave them access to the phone records would give them access to your email records, to your internet records, to your credit card records, to your bank records, to your phone location data. And the danger is you put all that information together, and they can determine everything about us. They can know more about us than our closest friends know, than our spouses know. And the only thing that -- if you give them all that data, then the only thing that's stopping them from doing that are these so-called backend safeguards which were routinely violated by the NSA and which we've -- we didn't have any opportunity to debate as to whether they were adequate or not because they were put in place entirely in secret. The government.",2.0
for,"Yeah. It sounds a lot more like Google than the government because -- and you have to take this -- this is actually a serious point. This is not the case that the government is tracking everything you do and can put it all together. And the government doesn't care what you're doing. They're actually, though, in the last 10 years, with the explosion of social media and the explosion of terms of service agreement and informed consent that no one reads, is -- what you just described emerging in the private sector, with a legal basis being a document which no one can really read and give informed consent to; unlike the program we're talking about, which is subject to extreme safeguards, rooted in the Constitution, backed up by both chambers of Congress and by the judiciary. And so I think you've really got to shift your terms of your argument here. This isn't the '70s with the FBI running around at the behest of Richard Nixon probing into people's lives. This is a world where the government is tightly regulated and overseen in a way subject to law. And it's the private sector, if anything, which is emerging as the ""they"" in your scary scenario.",2.0
against,"Well, the fact that the private sector may -- may threaten our privacy is not a justification to allow the government to invade our privacy, for two reasons. One, we can establish limits on private sector. But two, for the reasons I suggested earlier, there are lots more reasons to be concerned about the government having access to this information than the private sector having it. And that's reflected in our Constitution, which constitutionally limits government access to data, does not constitutionally limit private access to data. There's a reason for that. And it's a good reason.",2.0
for,"I'm -- I don't want to defend what the DNI said there. He was, as far as I can tell, surprised by the question and made an error in his answer. But, no, I'm sorry. How could he have said, I'm going to lie people after having gone out and said, ""I want everybody to understand this program.” That's -- it's quite clear that he had set up and agreed to provide this information to everyone. And so I don't think that we should be saying that there is a -- there's intentional lie being undertaken in that context. John Donvan:Other side want to respond? Michael German.",2.0

for,"Let me try this one. There -- no one looks at these numbers without reasonable suspicion. That's the standard that is required by some of the safeguards, not all of them, but some of the safeguards that are already built into this program. Right. That's right. So that was done quite consciously because everyone at NSA and in the government believed that the right answer was not to look at data without some reason to believe that the person that you're looking at is engaged in suspicious activity. The only difference between a standard law enforcement search and the searches we're talking about in the context of NSA is they gather the information first and put it in a database, but didn't search it without a reasonable suspicion. The reason that they gathered it first was because it was not practical to leave it where it was. They would not be able to do the searches in the time with the efficiency that they needed to use.",2.0
against,"So part -- -- part of it is that the harm comes from the initial collection, right? If we know -- and there's studies to show this -- if we know we're under surveillance, our behavior changes, right?

But even with the limited number of searches, they go three hops. So it's the reasonable suspicious number but the people they called, the people they called, and the people they called.

for,"I think that's a fair question. And the real answer is you don't need to believe the government. Sure, the government has access to particular threats. But it doesn't take a security clearance to know that there are a lot of people who would like nothing better than to kill everybody in this auditorium and would be delighted to have done it. We live -- that's the world we live in, and the technology that we all enjoy has empowered them. You couldn't have pulled off 9/11 30 years earlier. What I'm really suggesting is that having empowered everyone, and increasingly empowered people on the other side of the world who hate us, to cause serious damage here, we need to let the government use the technical tools that are created by lower cost for storing data to offset the advantage that the terrorists have. That's -- it seems to me you don't have to have a security clearance to have a commonsense appreciation of what the threat is and how empowered terrorists are these days.",2.0
against,"Sure. So we can demand accountability from our intelligence agencies, and we need to because the only way they're going to be effective -- we didn't know how bad things were on September 10, 2001, were right?

That's how we get effective government.",2.0
against,"Thank you. Thank you very much for having me tonight, and thanks to Stewart and Richard for a great debate. Let me close by talking about this problem from a different standpoint. =’m hopefully they only person in this room who’s actually been part of a terrorist conspiracy so I have a little bit of insight on what terrorists want. They want you to be afraid. They know they aren’t powerful enough to overthrow a government or popular enough to win an election. So their only tool is to use horrible violence to try to provoke a government into taking measures that damages itself. They know that when people are afraid they make bad decisions, they act irrationally, and their hope is that the government is going to overreact to the threat, right? They’re going to go after communities of suspicion rather than focusing on individuals who are meaning harm. One of the interesting things I found working in terrorist groups: they always have a manifesto, right? They create a clandestine organization and the first thing they do is tell everybody in the world who they are. From an undercover perspective, that’s bad policy, but the reason they do it is because they’re trying to provoke grievance so that -- they want to let the government know who to go after so that they start to build real grievance, and that’s what starts to undermine thegovernment, when it starts losing its legitimacy by doing things that violate its own values. That’s why = think the founding fathers were so genius when they created a system that inoculated against this kind of reaction, right? It made sure that the government was accountable to the people and limited in the power that it could use, particularly in violating the civil rights of Americans, and what they knew wasn’t that that was going to be a weak form of government, but that that would be the strongest government on earth. We don’t need to be afraid. We need to demand accountability and we don’t need to sacrifice privacy, especially for the illusion of secrecy.",3.0
for,"Thank you, John, and thank you, David and Michael, for an excellent discussion and debate. I hope the audience understands that neither Stewart nor I are in favor of an unfettered, unchecked executive authority to commit domestic spying. That’s not what we’re arguing here. We understand that this is an incredibly difficult area of governance and requires tough oversight, the involvement of Congress, and the involvement of the judiciary. So please understand that’s where we’re coming from. There is another side to this, aside from the legitimate interest in personal privacy that we all have, and it’s security. And this is, as = said in my opening, not abstract, and =’ll end with a brief anecdote. = was Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism in New York City Police Department. We were part of the FBI joint terrorism task force. In September 2008, we learned of a case. We knew nothing about it until we were told as result of electronic surveillance there was an individual in Denver developing a bomb and intending to transport it back to New York City for the purpose of attacking the New York City subway around, he thought, September 14, 15, or 16. We found out about that because of his electronic communication with his bomb-making trainer in Pakistan.He drove across the country, FBI surveillance team in Denver acquired him and began surveilling him in the course of his drive across the country with one to two kilograms of TATP explosive in his trunk. We began an investigation of his contact, who he was in telephonic communication with. As a result of that, dozens of people he was in communication with were identified. Quickly, his two key co-conspirators, and then subject to much higher levels of intrusion -- of intrusive investigation. This was a real plot against the city of New York, where I was at the NYPD, and it was stopped not entirely, but in large measure because of the techniques we were talking about here tonight. This is not abstract. There is another side to this, and it something which is very, very valuable.",3.0
against,"Thank you. Technology has changed the calculus of surveillance in a dramatic way. It used to be if the government wanted to find out everything about who you hung out with, what books you read, who you were talking to, what you thought, it was very difficult, very costly for it to do so, and that was a check on the government’s ability to invade our privacy. That check has gone out the window because of the -- because of Al Gore and the internet. We now -- it's now possible to learn everything about us through this third party information which Richard Falkenrath says we shouldn't be concerned about at all. I think we need to be concerned about it. I think we can strike a proper balance between the technology that makes it possible for this kind of very, very broad surveillance and the need to find bad guys. But we can't do so if the programs are run in secret, if the NSA is lying to us about it, and if we haven't had an opportunity to have a democratic deliberation. And when we don't have that democratic deliberation, it seems to me it's very likely that the security people are going to go overboard on the side of security. And when they're collecting texts, they're collecting data on every text that I send to my high school daughter when I go to pick her up from school, and she hasn't come out, and I say, ""Where are you? I'm here. Where are you? I'm here. Where are you? I'm here.” Why does the NSA need to know that information? The only reason that they have access to that information is because they did it in secret because if they had done it in public and told us they wanted to gather that information to keep us safe, I think we would have said no. And you should say no.",3.0
for,"Thanks, John. You know, when I started as general counsel of the National Security Agency, Janet Reno, the attorney general, came out for a visit. And this was a high-stakes meeting. She was deeply skeptical about whether this spy agency could be trusted at all, whether it understood what the Fourth Amendment was. And we were walking through an operations center with her when the director stopped, looked at a corporal who was going over some intercepts, and he said to the corporal, ""Stand up, sir.” And ""what do you do if you find a communication by an American?"" that corporal plucked out of a mass of people doing the intercepts, said, ""Sir, we segregate that. We cannot disseminate it unless there's foreign intelligence in it.” We must take the -- we must anonymize the data and destroy it if there's no intelligence in it,"" which was the rule. And I thought to myself, you know, the first rule of lawyering is don't ask a question if you don't know what the answer's going to be. But the director was absolutely sure that you could pick anybody out of that agency and ask him what the rules were. He would tell you and would be proud of the fact that he knew them and would obey them. That is the culture of the National Security Agency. If you givethem the rules, they will follow those rules. They have -- we have given them rules in this context. They are subject to lots of constraints. We cannot say, ""All of this public, or we might as well not try to gather intelligence.” We have to set rules, we have to count on people to enforce them, and then we have to count on the goodwill of our agencies to carry them out because that's our only hope of being able to do intelligence under law. I think we can do it.",3.0
