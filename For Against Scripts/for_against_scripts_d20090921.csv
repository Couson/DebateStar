for,"Well, I apologize if my voice is a little bit gravely but I used up most of it yesterday when I achieved a childhood dream of seeing the Green Bay Packers play at Lambeau Field. And I learned, aside from the fact that Green Bay can lose a game they’re supposed to win, I learned that you can get very funny faces on people’s faces when, very funny looks on people’s faces when you amble up to them in Green Bay and say, So what do you think of them Buy American provisions? It doesn’t, it doesn’t work so well. It’s a real conversation stopper. What I’d like to do is remind you of the proposition before you tonight and that is whether Buy American provisions will backfire. In fact, they’ve already backfired so you have little choice but to vote for the affirmative. First of all, what is Buy American? Buy American is a provision in federal legislation that mandates the purchase of U.S. made products in government contracts. Now, in some sense, who could be against Buy American? I want people to buy American products. I want a strong and healthy and vibrant American economy. I want good jobs and good wages for American workers. I think we can all agree on those propositions. But that’s not the issue. The debate here tonight is about the means to that laudable end. Buy America may sound like it’s a good idea, but the more you think about it, it’s actually counterproductive. Let me give you a specific example of what Buy America is. In the economic stimulus bill that we talked about earlier, that John Donvan mentioned -- it was passed by Congress earlier this year -- one section requires the use of American made steel in all stimulus related construction projects unless it costs more than twenty-five percent above foreign suppliers. Now, this is a good deal for the American steel industry but it’s a bad deal for the rest of us. By raising the cost of construction projects our nation can afford fewer of those projects. That means fewer jobs will be created with the limited amount of money we have to spend. If we have to pay a twenty-five percent premium for steel that leaves less money for all the other projects. In fact, this is not a trivial matter. Picture in your mind for a moment the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. There’s a lot of steel in that bridge. California had to repair the bridge a few years ago and the Buy America provisions were enforced. The domestic steel bid came in at, guess what?, twenty-three percent above the foreign bid. Now, why it wasn’t twenty-four percent above, I don’t know. But that added four hundred million dollars to the cost to repair the bridge. That’s almost half a billion dollars for one project. Now, what can you do with half a billion dollars? Instead of paying inflated prices for steel you could repair roads, build new bridges, build new schools, invest in green technology, provide health care for children or even perhaps reduce the fiscal deficit that is literally bankrupt... bankrupting the state of California. That’s more than just paying more and getting less. The real problem is this: Buy America is a bad jobs creation program. Steel is very capital intensive so when we increase production we don’t hire a lot of new workers. There are about a hundred and fifty thousand steel workers in the United States. There are seven million construction workers. There are 1.5 million unemployed construction workers. Construction is really labor intensive. So if we spend more taxpayer money on steel we can afford fewer construction projects that will employ more construction workers who really need the jobs. So why do we give U.S. steel producers a twenty-five percent handicap against foreign suppliers and other bidders? Well, they were the only industry that was powerful enough to get it into law. It’s corporate welfare, pure and simple. What percent of the steel sold in the United States is made in the United States? Seventy percent. They control seventy percent of the market and they want more and they want the taxpayer to pay for it. Buy America has already backfired because it creates bureaucratic red tape that has forced state and local governments to delay starting infrastructure projects and therefore, delay getting people back to work. In Perkins, Oklahoma they’re planning on building a new waste water plant for fifteen million dollars. It was shovel ready. The government came in to give them another 1.5 million in free stimulus money. But it wasn’t free. It came with Buy America and other pieces of red tape and it raised the cost of the project even more than the town would be getting from the federal government. So now the town has to go out and borrow more money to get the project going. And this is not an isolated example. Here’s a news article from last week’s Wall St. Journal how Buy America can hurt U.S. firms, and it talks about how, various ways in which U.S. firms cannot bid on municipal projects here in the United States because they may make components that are sent for final processing in Canada. They come back from Canada, and it’s called a Canadian product even though a lot of the value added is made here in the United States. And that just doesn’t make sense. Many think that Buy America is aimed at China. Well, we aimed at China but we hit Canada and now we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. Canadian governments are boycotting U.S. firms in their infrastructure projects and costing us jobs here in the United States. So in sum, Buy America is not a good idea. It raises the cost of -- It sounds like a good idea but it’s not a good idea. It raises the cost of infrastructure projects. It pads the bottom line of the steel industry. It reduces the number of construction workers we can employ with our precious tax dollars and when other countries employ their own buy local provisions our exporters will be cut out of their lucrative market, those lucrative markets abroad and will lose even more manufacturing jobs here in the United States. I’m sure you’ve heard of the saying, What’s good for GM is good for America. Well, we know that’s not true. And what’s good for the steel industry, its workers and its executives is not good for America, either, necessarily. So Buy America is costly corporate welfare. It’s already backfired. Please vote affirmative. Thank you very much.",
against,"Thank you very much. I have to tell you that I’ve discarded a lot of my notes because I want to correct the previous speaker. The fact of the matter is that China did win the bid for the Bay Bridge and the fact of the matter is that the Bay Bridge is now almost eight months behind schedule and that the steel that came from China won’t hold the weld. And they’re not sure if they’re going to have to rip it all down and rebuild it, so that, if we talk about what that represents in lost dollars and productivity, it’s way more than the number that Doug used. Let me then go back to my notes. The fact of the matter is that three trillion tax dollars per year are spent by the federal government in federal procurement. And no one is saying that it’s simply, that you get the money that comes from tax dollars and you use it to buy Chinese goods. And then the fact of the matter is this has gone through the roof since the passage of NAFTA and PNTR. And what we’ve done is we’ve lost, in our manufacturing base from 1949 to ’69, manufacturing was twenty-eight percent of the economy of America and we were the world’s largest creditor nation. By the time we got to the end of last year manufacturing was nine percent of the economy and we have now become the world’s largest debtor nation. The fact of the matter is, if we don’t start buying products that are made here, what we’ll end up doing is borrowing Chinese money to import Chinese parts and have laid-off workers. And the fact of the matter is that Buy America stimulates the economy, creates good jobs, makes the industrial economy work and if the industrial economy works then we need engineers, innovation and we need the other pieces that make that economy hum. There was all kinds of yelling and screaming, when the Buy America provision was made public in the stimulus bill, like this is something new. There’s been Buy America provisions since 1930s. And the fact of the matter is that they’ve been good for creating jobs. If we go back to the period from 1994 when we abandoned, in a much more aggressive way, industrial manufacturing in America, in that period of time America has accumulated a 6.5 trillion dollar trade debt. We’ve had twenty-five years in a row, exacerbated since 1994, of year after year after year record breaking trade deficits. This year people will say, Yeah, well, the trade deficit’s falling down. It’s probably going to come in around five hundred billion dollars and we’ve had a huge drop. That’s simply because there’s no purchasing power and we’ve had the collapse of the credit markets. There can be an argument made that a large part of the economic collapse that we saw is because there was too much money in the wrong direction. And the fact of the matter is that, that money, making its hands into a much, much smaller group, led to an inability of us to sustain. And we’ve, over the last fifteen years, gone to personal debt that is unsustainable. All of that because we’ve abandoned the idea of not only making things in America, but buying things that are made in America. I won’t spend too much time, but if we look at what’s going on in most of our trading partners, in the E.U. and spend time with China... I never heard a word in America when French President Sarkozy said that they’re going to stimulate their economy and they’re going to stimulate their auto industry on the condition that every taxpayer dollar of French currency that’s invested in France is going to go to prop up the French auto industry and the French auto industry had to commit to no layoffs. Surprisingly, the European economy is bouncing back faster than ours. I didn’t hear a word. I didn’t hear a word when in May the Chinese government said that their stimulus program was going to be steered and directed towards not just Buy China -- there is a slight difference -- Buy Chinese. I didn’t hear a word here. Think of the auto industry. I’ve only ever driven a North American car, big three. I’ve never had a bad one. But for some reason, we’re prepared as a society to tolerate a deficit in automobiles between South Korea and Japan of forty-five billion dollars a year. If a billion dollars equals thirteen thousand family-supporting jobs, just in the auto sector, year after year after year, we can’t get into their market. They have a view that buying a Japanese car in Japan is a good thing. China has recently announced that it intends to dominate the world in renewable energy products. A company called Suntech Power Holdings said in an interview that to build market share -- this is what’s coming from China -- to build market share it’s selling solar panels on the American market for less than the cost of materials, assembly and shipping. This is a decision made in China. And we’re saying that we want to be the leader in renewable energy but we don’t have a program to stimulate demand or to buy renewable energy products that are made in America. Having said that, I see that my time is up. But keep in mind that in order to do that China cheats on its currency, it manipulates its cost of production and we sit back and say that it would cost us jobs if we did the same thing.",
for,"Thank you very much. Let me just begin first by emphasizing a point which Doug Irwin made, but in relation to a story. When I was a student at Oxford one of my professors actually told me that he’d gone to Whitehall to advise and he was surprised to find that while he thought economics oversimplified things, that in fact, people in Whitehall were working with even more simplistic models. They usually thought X led to Y and they stopped there. Y leading to Z, Z leading in turn to X. All of that was completely beyond them. They were extremely oversimplifying. The problem, I think, with Mr. Gerard is, I think, as Doug was pointing out, and with the opposing side basically, is that you think that Buy America will create jobs in the steel using sectors, for example, or in the steel industry. First, in fact, X affects Y. But what does that do to the rest of the system? Because you are then opening up a whole series of additional effects which are actually going to overwhelm the initial primary impact. And that’s essentially what we need to focus on. What are these additional effects? One, of course, is that downstream industries typically become more uncompetitive. We know when President Bush put on the steel tariffs in ’92 the effect was, in fact, to price out a whole lot of steel using industries, including autos, which indeed, there was a famous study which shows that about two hundred thousand jobs may have been lost while we gained a few basically through protecting steel. So that’s point number one. The second point is that you get out of this, and still, even if we didn’t have this problem we would have the problem of retaliation. And I would say it’s not tit for tat retaliation necessarily. It’s also monkey see, monkey do kind of imitation. While we do something others do the same thing. If you look at the 1930s it was exactly spreading and diffusion of all kinds of trade barriers, starting out from the Smoot-Hawley, et cetera. And this, I think, led to essentially what we in economics call a nuclear winter, basically. There was a chaotic outbreak of all kinds of trade barriers. That came home to roost in turn, on our export performance, on everybody’s export performance. And I think this is something we need to remember, that as we go into this, policies like Buy America, that is what we are going to get into. We already see that, as Doug was pointing out, in a variety of fields. And I’m sure Susan will pick up that theme. The large numbers of actual actions which we already see by way of diffusion of these kinds of tariffs. And we are actually the biggest traders in the world. Every state has export industries. I’ve been looking at that. You have basically, therefore, a lot of your jobs at stake. And those are going to outweigh the few jobs you may save through Buy America provisions. I think this is, if you look at Buy America, if you know a little bit of history -- I know just a little bit and Doug knows much more -- but Buy America, when did it first get passed in this country? It has to be in this country, obviously, if it was Buy America. It was 1933, right after the Depression, the great . And that’s what set the stage. And I think we are now re-enacting that after this current crisis. So beware, is all I say. Caveat emptor, if you want, feel inclined to be working for the other side. Then I think we also got the argument, to look at the negative arguments produced by Mr. Gerard in his interesting comment, he said, Well, manufacturers are important and we need to support them. And he’s not the first one to have said that. There has been an anti-de-industrialization movement in England, about twenty years ago. There was also a Berkeley movement called Manufacturing Matters. And I think Mr. Gerard is really harking back to it. And this is a case where you assert that manufacturing is some sort of massive externalities. And I would simply say, I’ll just quote my old teacher, Professor Solow, who is Nobel Laureate and the father figure on the Democratic side. I’m a Democrat. He said, I know there are lots of industries in massive externalities. But there’s a four dollar worth of marginal, social marginal product and the private margin product is one, one dollar. And he said, My problem is I don’t know which ones they are. And the problem is, and compounded by the fact that the lobbies know where the externalities are. And I think this is the problem. It’s not that we don’t believe that there are externalities, but for Mr. Gerard to assume that they are necessarily in steel or in manufacturers more generally has never been proven. And I don’t think any Democrat would support that view. In fact, what we do is essentially to argue that we must support broader policies like R&D support and so on, but not go into specific activities cause that’s exactly the wrong way to go and it gets captured by, by several people. And I think this is what we need to worry about. Finally, I would just touch on one thing which drives, I think, the union movement. And I can understand their fear because I can easily produce models being a theorist also, aside from an activist on these issues. One can easily produce models where international trade actually affects your workers, that in fact the fear is, on the part of unions, that trade with the poor countries produces paupers in the rich countries. Now, a lot of work has been done on this. Actually, there’s very little evidence of this. In fact, there are studies, including my own with Bob Lawrence at Harvard, which show actually that the pressure on our wages, which is a real problem and, you know, as a Democrat I’m entirely sympathetic to the problem. That has been brought about by extremely acute labor saving technical change, by the fact that the unionization has also gone down for reasons which don’t have much to do with globalization or trade. Given that, I think a lot of us have argued with empirical evidence that trade with poor countries, trade with emerging countries has actually kept the consumption cost of workers’ wages down. So it, in fact, it has moderated the --",

against,"MacARTHUR I have totell you that I wrote a book about NAFTA, called The Selling of Free Trade. That’s why I’m here, not because I’m publisher of Harper’s magazine. But may I make a cheap debater’s point right at the outset and say that Professor Irwin has already veered off the proposition. This is a, the question I thought that was put was, Buy American policies, not the Buy American provision in the legislation that just passed six or eight months ago. And if we’re going to discuss this broadly we have to talk about tariffs versus free trade, protectionism versus free trade. That’s what we’re really talking about here. I would also add that, I hope we can come back to Smoot-Hawley because Smoot-Hawley is a canard, as it is acknowledged by many, many mainstream economists who say that it had little or no affect on exacerbating the Great Depression. But there’s a reason why Thomas Carlyle called economics the dismal science. I happen to think it’s because he understood intuitively that it was not a science, and that it’s not a science because you cannot conduct a controlled experiment in economics the way you can in hard science, in real science. And as a non-science, we have to turn back to the great theorists of free trade and the anti-protectionists like David Ricardo and Richard Cobden and understand that they, in the early 19th Century, could not imagine a world where anybody with money and labor could plug into a power source anywhere in the world and make virtually anything. These theorists, to whom Professor Bhagwati, Professor Irwin and many of their colleagues cling with religious fervor, with -- I might even say -- Marxist fervor, because Ricardo had a great influence on Marx, is what distorts the debate. As then MIT economist Paul Krugman, who was and still is a partisan of free trade, noted in a 1991 book called Geography and Trade, the quote: The tendency of international economists to turn a blind eye to the fact that countries both occupy and exist in space, a tendency so deeply entrenched that we rarely even realize we are doing it, has, I would submit, had some serious costs. These lie not so much in lack of realism -- all economic analysis is more or less unrealistic -- as in the exclusion of important issues, and above all, important sources of evidence. Now, let’s admit, on the protectionist side, that Buy American policies are indirect tariffs, indirect subsidies, whatever you want to call them. And there are many statistics to support the protectionist model. I don’t pretend they’re definitive any more than my economist friends can make the argument that their statistics or their studies are definitive because they’re not scientific experiments. But since we’re talking about protectionism versus free trade, essentially, we can site some spectacularly successful protectionist schemes, Mexico, poor, beleaguered, exploited Mexico in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, had a program called import substitution, a nice way of saying, or a technical way of saying, buy Mexican. And Mexico enjoyed the highest growth rates in its history, through the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, of, roughly, I think averaging about 7 percent. Just to give you a more specific recent example, we still have a 25 percent tariff, import tariff on pickup trucks in the United States. That’s why, Toyota, until very recently, was still manufacturing pickups at their NUMMI, joint operating plant in Fremont, California, in their joint operation with General Motors. That’s what kept Toyota in the game, was the 25 percent tariff on imported pickups. It’s probably not a coincidence that in 1945, the average US tariff on dutiable imports was 28 percent. And in the same year, manufacturing employment which as you all knows pays better than working at Wal-Mart, manufacturing employment as a percentage of total US employment was 35 percent. It’s also likely not a coincidence, that in 2008, the average tariff on dutiable imports was 4 percent—by the way these are Professor Irwin’s numbers— and in the same year manufacturing employment as a percentage of to—total US employment, was just under 10 percent. Now. Again, this is anecdotal evidence, I don’t pretend it’s scientific, but in 1979, the year in which manufacturing employment peaked in the United States, the median weekly earnings for all US workers in 2009 dollars, was $716.47. In the second quarter of 2009, the median weekly earnings for US workers, was $734, just slightly above, so we can make the argument that a pro-free trade, lower-tariff economy has possibly contributed to the stagnation of wages, I think we can say anecdotally, that because manufacturing employment has declined, and manufacturing jobs pay better than service jobs generally speaking, this has contributed to the stagnation of wages. Now, this is not only happening in the, labor-intensive traditional assembly-line jobs. Business Week just had a cover story called “America’s Manufacturing Crisis” in which they talked about, the crisis in high-tech manufacturing. And the causes of this manufacturing decline in American high-tech, quote, “are numerous, complex, and a long time in the making.” That’s from Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor who used to work at IBM, and used to run Eastman Kodak’s Digital Consumer Products Union. And then, Business Week goes on, to paraphrase they say two decades of unconstrained outsourcing to Asia have hollowed out much of America’s base of supplies, factory managers, and skilled technicians. US private capital markets meanwhile are loath to tie up their billions in factories and machinery. In the boom years from 1994 to 1999, when then economy surged 26 percent, US manufacturing capacity went up by 44 percent. Okay? But from 2002 through 2007 when the US expanded by 17 percent, manufacturing capacity rose a paltry 5 percent.",
against,"MacARTHUR Okay. And I’ll just say that, it’s no coincidence that permanent normal trade relations with China were passed, in 2000.",
for,"Thank you, and thank you very much for inviting us here today to debate this very timely and very interesting and very complicated topic. I’m going to start by talking about Hire American policies, which is part of this debate although no one’s talked about it yet and I’m going to make quick work of that, because quite frankly Hire American restrictions are un-American. They are discriminatory, they reek of discrimination, they deny us the very diversity that has made the United States, as competitive as we are. Immigrants built this nation and all you need to do is look at some of the companies that were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants the employ millions of Americans, including Google, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, Proctor and Gamble, duPont and even US Steel. Buy American? Buy American sounds like motherhood and apple pie, and, unfortunately, Buy American policies hurt America, and hurt Americans. And we have history to point to and we have, the fact that the United States has to export to grow, to point to, and the fact that the risk of retaliation is very, very real indeed, let’s start with history. Rick mentioned Smoot-Hawley, well, guess what. In the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act we raised our tariffs, it was perfectly legal under the international trading system at the time. It ultimately prolonged and deepened the Great Depression. No country, no country has ever reached or sustained a level of prosperity with economic isolationism as their policy, with trade protectionism as their policy, with buy national policies. In fact if you look at the 1990s the countries that grew the fast in the 1990s, were countries that opened their markets, followed our lead by the way, opening our markets. They grew three times faster than the countries that did not open their markets. 95 percent of the world’s population, meaning the world’s consumers, live outside of our borders. Those are our customers and if anyone thinks that we Americans have enough money to buy our way to recovery, and to future competitiveness without exports, you’ve got another thing coming. Half of GDP growth, more than half of global GDP growth going forward over the next five years, will come in the advanced developing countries. The bulk of global economic growth will come outside the United States. And if you’re talking about stimulus packages and quite frankly, Rick, this debate is about Buy American policies, meaning the government telling us, that it will not buy foreign goods whether they are higher quality, whether they are better priced. $3.5 trillion will be spent in the next several years, by other countries on stimulus. Globally. We need a piece of that. And if you are a Caterpillar worker in Illinois, if you work for G.E., if you work for any of the major manufacturers in the United States that sell to these countries, you want a part of that action. China is going to be spending the vast majority of the $550 billion it’s putting into stimulus, on infrastructure. That is business for American exporters. India is going to be spending anywhere from $20-$70 billion in roads construction. Now. This issue, this canard, of—that we don’t manufacture anything, is utterly absurd. Some of you may be surprised to know that the United States remains the single biggest manufacturer in the world, bar none. $1.7 trillion in manufacturing outputs, China is a distant second, at $1.3 trillion, with Japan and Germany following up to the rear. One in six manufacturing jobs depends on exports, 6 million US jobs depend on manufactured good exports. And if you look at US economic growth you discover, that our manufacturing is in fact 20 percent of our GDP, not 9 percent. And it continues to grow, our manufacturing output. Yes, our manufacturing employment, because of productivity enhancements, technology, has not kept pace. But if you look for example at a company like UPS that tells us for every 40 new packages that are shipped overseas, they hire a new American worker. Those are high-paying blue-collar jobs, Fed Ex, exactly the same kind of statistics. And in many cases you’re talking about, these are Teamsters who are going to be hired. Retaliation, retaliation is not some myth, retaliation is very, very real, not only did we see it after…Smoot-Hawley, we saw it after the Buy American language, it is not coincidence, that within six weeks of the Buy American legislature on the stimulus package moving through the United States Congress, it is not coincidence that the Chinese suddenly decided to let their provinces favor local companies, because before that a lot of Americans were starting to make a lot of money in those markets. We need access to those markets, and we need to be exporting to stay competitive. The folks who are telling us, this isn’t going to happen, they are ignoring the fact that the Canadians have already retaliated, the Chinese have already retaliated. The US Chamber of Commerce estimates that for every 1 percent of this global stimulus bonanza that is out there, that we lose because of retaliation, we lose 175,000 jobs. That eclipses the, what, eight, 9,000 jobs that the Petersen Institute has told us could possibly be created in the steel industry in the United States, and Doug has already talked about how that has hurt other workers in construction and so on. So let me close…as follows. One, remind you, there is zero evidence that buy national policies create more jobs than they sacrifice, and in fact the data is very, very compelling the other way, trade isolationism kills jobs, it does not create jobs. Buy American sounds good. And the issues that are being raised by the other side in many ways are legitimate issues. But Buy American policies and trade isolationism will not solve any one of the problems that they are describing. Buy American sounds good, good sound bite, bad policy, hurts America, hurts American jobs, thank you.",
against,"Thank you, thank you, I’m delighted to be here. I was once a free-trader myself, as was Philip Verlager who I see had a letter in the New York Times just Sunday saying he was once a free-trader. Worked for the Petersen Institute, decided it was totally unrealistic. Enough is enough. I’m a little tired of people who keep telling us—not these people. That wasn’t aimed at you, that, uh— Little tired of being told time and again, that being worried about free trade is an oversimplified point of view. I’m a little tired of being given simplistic examples, of where buying, say, steel in the US, will raise construction costs and therefore cost American jobs. I’m tired of being told that empirical studies invariably show that free trade will create—has almost no effect on jobs in the US, and you know I better tell you the truth about that, because, I have a whole bunch of things to say, I’m not going to get to them, and I’m going to forget some. The fact of the matter is, despite what Professor Bhagwati said, and despite his own studies, most studies find a direct negative impact, from free trade on wages, and on the creation of jobs. Most studies. Not by wide-eyed progressives from the New School, but by mainstream economists. Most studies, so let’s get the facts straight. I want to go down this list because this is too important, I’m afraid, to leave to economic theorists. I believed in Ricardian economics, I still do. Exchange is the key to economic growth. You have something I want, I want something—I have something you want. It leads to economic growth, but it is a narrow idealistic theory, in a very complex world. First, Buy America is not illegal. China agreed to the very terms we are citing in this stimulus bill. That’s number one. It is not illegal, neither by the way are the tariffs on tires. Not illegal, they agreed to it, in the international agreements. Number two. The fiscal policy becomes necessarily ineffective when 20 to 30 to 40 percent of every dollar we spend, to pump up our economy in a recessionary emergency, leaks overseas. We’re not saying all—we should not have exports and imports, nobody on my teams thinks we shouldn’t have export growth, and even import growth. Nobody I know believes that. But we do want effective fiscal policy and that is what we are talking about in the narrow sense. Will there be a trade war? Darn it, I am tired of these scare tactics, I’m tired of claiming there will be a repeat of the 1930s. Is China up in arms against this policy, I suspect China is now willing to talk a little bit, because they see maybe President Obama is ever so slightly serious about imposing rights he was given in international treaties into which China agreed. Is China not pushing its tires, a surge in tires here? Of course they are. And that was a response, another issue. Let’s stop isolating this economic theory from the real world. China subsidizes, all kinds of countries subsidize, all kinds of countries push exports. We have to begin to realize that. Let’s look at what’s happened, and I’m skipping as you can tell a little bit, let’s look at what’s happened in America since free trade. Don’t think this side of the podium is fighting an uphill battle. They won. They’ve won for decades. Tariffs have come down significantly. And where does America stand in terms of wages, you’d think, judging by what some of them said, we’re doing great. The median male worker in America today, makes less than the median male worker after inflation did in the 1970s. Think about that. That stagnation probably never occurred in American economic history before. We did some numbers on this, it’s pretty stun— I’m not going to go into those because, my time is running low, maybe we’ll get to it in the Q-and-A. Frank Levy, and Peter Temin, mainstream economists, at MIT, are alarmed, that annual earnings of all workers, not just males, male and female, all races, all ethnicities, plus fringe benefits, which people often say are left out by—people like Robert Lawrence often make this case—plus fringe benefits haven’t been keeping up with productivity since roughly the late 1970s. Wages are supposed to keep up with productivity. What’s going on, is free trade part of this? I think it is part of it. Is it all of it, no, is it most of it, it may not even be most of it. But it’s probably some of it and we’ve gotta start thinking about that. I have to say one other thing about economic theory while I’m going through this litany. There is a very strong emphasis on keeping wages down in America, you may have noticed, every time wages go up the Federal Reserve in the good old days, that was before the crisis, would try to push wages down because it was going to be inflationary. A very important theory of why economies grow, has been thrown aside. That is economies grow because American workers, and the immigrant workers who come to America make enough money to support demand so the companies can grow. And then companies invest. All through American history, wages rose inexorably. In America, median wages, average wages, rose, and were a source of economic growth. That stopped somewhere in the 1970s. And we better start thinking about it, what am I thinking, what am I talking about? Not full-scale protectionism, not the end of exports and imports. But a serious, committed, complex…not simple theory, of why economies grow, but a complex analysis and approach to dealing with a high dollar. With high debt in America. With trade inequalities.

And when I talk about when I have arguments with my friends in the economics departments of these various universities, I have to ask myself if they’ve ever met a factory worker, have they ever talked to a steelworker or to an autoworker or to an electrical worker who’s lost their job, because the United States has been pursuing pro-buy foreign policies for the last 15 years, that’s what we have now with NAFTA, and the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. These are, as Professor Bhagwati will be the first to acknowledge, preferential trade agreements, not free trade agreements, and, something has to be done on our side to compensate for these tremendous advantages, given to foreign manufacturers. Yes, some of it is low-end manufacturing but not all of it is low-end manufacturing. And in order to redress this tremendous trade imbalance there are various methods at our disposal. Tariffs, Buy American provisions, et cetera, et cetera. But to go on talking as if there is a free trade system in place that’s being threatened is preposterous. If you look at NAFTA and PNTR they’re much closer, and this is a corporate lawyer who first explained it to me when I explained to him how the labor market works between the United States and Mexico and the United States and China, it’s more like a labor racketeering agreement.

Wages of average Americans have stagnated and fallen, that the industrial strength of America has gone from being sapped, uh, at twenty-eight percent at one time, now down to nine percent. We’ve had an accumulated trade debt that no one on the other side has tried to defend, of six and a half trillion dollars. Some of you in the room may know what a billion is. How many of you know what a trillion is? Think about this: A billion seconds is roughly the nineteen...late 1950s. A billion minutes ago, Christ was on earth. A billion hours ago we lived in caves. And in the period since 1994 we’ve accumulated a six and a half trillion dollar trade debt. We’ve hollowed out our economy to the point now where you’ve got the Chinese will probably raise at the G20 whether or not we should move to another form of currency because the American dollar is not sustainable.

for,"Well, first of all, just in terms of the proposition before the house, I think they have backfired. I think that’s demonstrable. I think you have no choice but to vote affirmative. But let me make some major concessions to the other side. I think what you’re hearing is things we’ve heard in the 1980s. We’ve actually even heard them in the 1950s and beforehand -- and that is that economic change is very hard and very painful and we should do something to address that. I happen to think that the remedies they’re suggesting are wrong, will backfire and actually don’t really address the underlying problem. We’ve talked about the declining share of workers in manufacturing. Manufacturing is a victim of its own success. A century ago a third of the work force in the United States was in agriculture. Now it’s about two percent. Why? Because the productivity of the American farmers is absolutely astronomical. The same thing has happened with American factories. They’re churning out stuff and we just need fewer workers. They’re much more capital intensive as productivity. Think about Manchester, New Hampshire. I’m from New Hampshire. If you’ve ever been to visit Manchester -- lovely city, huge brick building, over a mile long, former textile mill. Not a single shoe, not a single textile made there anymore. It’s a thriving city. It wasn’t always thriving and it went through some very difficult times. But it made that change. It had to. The jobs actually were stolen by the south, not by a foreign country. And then they left for the south for other countries. Jeff Madrick said, You know, I’m tired of hearing about people saying trade doesn’t, you don’t lose jobs. Actually, I’ll give you a copy of my book, because in one of the chapters I say, First thing, trade destroys jobs. Trade also creates jobs. But there’s no denying that trade destroys jobs and certainly in poor, competing industries. But it creates jobs elsewhere. The question is the balance. Guess what? Technology destroys jobs. What’s happened to all the bank tellers? What’s happened to all the secretaries? Do we stop technology? No, we have to adjust to it and become a better society for it. I do believe the trade deficit is a problem. But it’s not mercantilism of China or what have you. China is very poor but their savings rate...What was the personal savings rate in the United States? Zero. But they can save in China. Thank you.",3.0
against,"MacARTHUR Very quickly, there are lots of anecdotal examples of de-automation in outsourcing, by the way, Professor Irwin, where products that used to be made on automated assembly lines in the United States are now being made by hand in Mexico and China. But I’ll put that aside and just say that I finally get to my main point, and get away from the statistics, and point out to you that Japan and China don’t believe in free trade any more than I do. And if we don’t start buying American soon or doing something, installing some kind of compensatory tariffs, Buy American provisions -- and I’ll acknowledge to the other side that the tariff such as it is has been corruptly applied throughout the decades and the centuries that we’ve had it. But that generally speaking, there has to be some kind of compensation for American policy that has favored the production of things that used to made here by cheap labor in foreign countries where you cannot organize a union and you have no Environmental Protection Agency. But even if you don’t feel an ethical obligation to your fellow citizens or to the poor workers working for thirty cents an hour in China or a dollar twenty-five an hour in Mexico, even if you have no concern, ethical concern about them, I urge you to come over to our side, vote for our side out of enlightened self-interest. Because if we don’t do something to compensate for these pro-cheap labor, pro-outsourcing policies we’ve been pursuing for the last twenty years particularly -- but really since the war -- we’re going to end up with a political vacuum that will be filled not by a nice, civilized businessman like Ross Perot, but by a very ugly rightwing populist. It’s already brewing in the United States. And if you don’t hurry up and do something about it, there won’t be any discussion about free trade anymore. There’s going to be only discussion about how to shut the doors to immigration and how to keep the labor unions from organizing immigrants, for example.",3.0
for,"Let me first focus on Buy American provisions because that’s really what the motion is about. And there I would just simply say that while immediately you see that you’re saving some jobs, you’re losing many more because of the downstream effects, retaliation effects, diffusion or protectionism effects. By the time you’ve added it up, you’re losing far more than you’re gaining. And I think it’s just being penny wise and pound foolish. And that’s the fundamental point we need to understand. The second point relates to the more general issue of protectionism which has come up from the other side. I think certainly, Mr. Gerard, and I think to some extent, the other people on the other side, have been focusing on the fear that trade has actually putting downward pressure on the wages of our workers. As a Democrat, I’m certainly concerned about it and I think most people are concerned about it. I mean, these are the bottom thirty percent of our society and we ought to worry about them. The only question is whether protectionism is the answer. And I think what is going on basically is that massive technological change is going on, and I think we need to worry about that and how to adapt to that. And if we don’t do that we’re not going to get an, appropriate answer to the problem. You take acute technological change going on assembly lines. Entire assembly lines are wiped out. If you’re going to see, you know, take your child to see Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times and they say that he goes berserk on the assembly line and they say, Can you take me to see an assembly line? Well, you can but you won’t see Charlie Chaplin there. You will see five people in a cage up there. So what has happened is that large numbers of jobs have been lost and you’re getting more volatility as a result, for the unskilled workers. And we have to really rethink the whole issue of how we accommodate the institutional change to be able to support workers, but protectionism is not the answer.",3.0

That is our first priority. The way it’s now structured, our stimulus to get ourselves out of this recession, will leak badly overseas. That’s the principle issue. The opposition has talked about how it will inevitably cost jobs that use simple, people over there think it will save jobs in the near term. But if you thought about it for a second or two you’d realize there are second, third and fourth order effects. The fact is that both theory and most empirical studies suggest that more jobs are lost than the opposition is acknowledging. In fact, on balance the theory says a significant portion of jobs or wages are lost in this kind of situation. In balance, the whole wage package may be higher but the distribution of those wages changes. Now, free market theory is very compelling. It is a simple and pretty ideology. For the most part, the opposition has put forward this theory. And I think, judging by some of the questions, many of you believe it out there -- that efficient markets exist. I’m a little surprised I hear so much out there, given the financial crisis because we were told time and again that bonuses made sense, that securitization made sense, that even some people -- like Alan Greenspan, and to some degree, Ben Bernanke -- told us high house prices make sense.

We remain the single largest manufacturer in the world. We want to be selling those turbines, those earth movers, that transportation equipment, the aircraft. It’s very, very important. And we care as much about U.S. jobs as the other side. However, not a single solitary one of the arguments that they have made would create a single job. And in fact, if you look at the proposition here, the proposition here would destroy -- Buy American/Hire American policies we have been able to show, without question -- would destroy more jobs than it would create. It sounds patriotic. In fact, Buy American/Hire American policies hurt America, hurt Americans. There is zero evidence of any country ever using economic isolationism and buy national policies to achieve and sustain economic development. Someone mentioned Japan. I remember twenty years ago, thirty years ago these same folks were telling us the Japanese were going to wipe out all our manufacturing. We are still, by far, the largest manufacturer in the world. We are the largest exporter in the world. There are millions of U.S. jobs that depend on these exports and that includes exports that we can and should and will be making to foreign countries that have stimulus packages. Clearly, the vote has to be on which side has convinced you that the policies will create more jobs and more opportunities for Americans. Clearly, that is a vote in the alternative because Buy American policies have and have already failed.",3.0
