Some of you may be surprised that Republicans would agre e to this. They're supposed to be the fiscally conservative party . But I've always said the reason I know the Republicans are the pro -life party is they always find themselves in the fetal position . And that's true on -- now more than eve r before.",
for,"So, thank you very much . I appreciate all of you being here . And I want to thank the organizers for having this debate . Not just because it's an important issue, but because my wife gave birth to our second daughter about 10 weeks ago, and that was the best night of sleep I've had in a long time last night here in New York . So, I will be asking for your support, along with Alison, for raising the gas tax by 10 cents . Now, in full d isclosure, I want to admit that I prefer to pay less for gas . All right ? I recognize that this initiative, while important, is not necessarily very popular. So I was trying to think back in my mind, when have I had to advocate for something that was imp ortant to me but not very popular ? And I go back to 1992, when I needed a date for prom, right? Very important to me, not very popular. I hope I have more success here tonight. So, what else happened in 1992 ? It was the last time that the federal gas tax had been raised . Now, if the gas tax had been indexed back in 1992 to inflation, just like many other things are, right, it would be about 10 cents higher today . But because of political inability to take a tough vote on this issue, right, the gas tax has remained where it has been . So, think about that, though? That 1992 dollar, its purchasing power has been cut more than in half. So, a dollar today from 1992 is worth about 40 cents, rig ht? So, a skeptic of -- skeptics of government often say, “Well, why can't government be more like business?” Well, what business is out there taking in 1992 dollars in revenue and paying out 2 015 dollars . Could you pay your expenses right nowon what you were making in 1992, inflation adjusted ? And other folks will say, well, you know, there are more cars on the road, and they're burning more gas . Well, cars today are much more fuel efficient . Some cars don't even use any gas . So -- and more cars and trucks will mean more wear and tear on our highways . So the right thing to do is just to raise it, just like the cost of everything else has gone up . And as state DOTs, we are very focused on doing more with less and stretching tho se dollars further and further. In fact, if you look at state DOTs now, the vast majority of them have moved from expanding the system, even in our places that still need capacity, to maintaining the assets that we have, right ? These are big, important s ystems, and we need to maintain them . Unfortunately -- and in Colorado, all of -- almost all of the money that we get goes to system preservation .We're not expanding the system right now . But the money that we're putting into that system does not equal a system that is improving . It's actually declining, and it's hard. It's a tough decision to say, let that bridge, or let that road go. It's not a good way to run a business . And government skeptics say things like, you know, why ca n't you do more with less ? Why can't you be more efficient ? I would argue we are doing more with less . We're doing a lot more with less. You know, we have changed, we have shrunk our agencies . We have changed the techniques and technologies we have us ed to extend the life of our roads . We repair bridges now in a weekend instead of taking months to do that, right? But even though our systems arenot expanding, the demands are growing ever more . You know, I was talking to one of our, you k now , peop le on the other side earlier, and they said they lived in MacLaine, Virginia. If you think about MacLaine, Virginia, right, it has grown up with lots of subdivisions . People want signals . They want new lanes . A new signal can cost $100,000 up front, an d then it must be maintained seven days a week, 365 days a year, right ? So we can't keep doing more with less . In we don't raise the federal gas tax, we're going to have to do less with less. And that means the system is going to suffer . But it's not just about maintaining our system . You know, Colorado is going through an economic boom right now, thanks to Governor Hi ckenlooper . And, you know, but our interstate system is causing us to choke on that growth . So the interstate system was designed in the 1960s in Colorado for a population of the 1980s that they thought would be about 3.3 million. We're at 5 1/2 people today . We're going to 8 million people in the next 20 years . Where are all those cars and drivers going to go, right ? Are they going to sit on that existing system ? So in Colorado right now, hundreds of thousands of motorists lose 40 hours a year out of their life sitting in congestion . Now, we have one project that's ready to go, just like there are projects across the country that could go, but for a lack of funding . And that project is to widen I -25. It'll save lives, it'll reduce congestion . And that project will -- at current funding levels, we'll get to that project in 2070 . That means an entire generation of pe ople will be born and likely die before we widen that roadway, right ? That's not a good way to run a system . And it's not just about roadways . So here on the north -- in the northeast where I used to work, I worked on the Northeast Corridor C ommissio n. This is the -- the trains that run from Washington, D.C . to Boston. And to call that system antiquated would be polite, right ? There's a tunnel in Baltimore that was built in the 1870s . Trains have to go through it at 30 miles an hour. There's -- there's a -- there's a major bridge that takes 30 men and women to open by hand. That doesn't sound t erribly efficient . The Bridge on the R iver Kwai was more modern, right ? We desperately need a new tunnel underneath the Huds on to relieve train congestion here in New York. And people say, well, let the states pay for it. It's $10 billion . New Jersey says, ""We can't afford it . Let New York pay for it."" New York says, ""We can't afford $10 billion."" That's why you need a pr operly funded federal system . This has profound impacts on our country . I am the son of immigrants . And I can remember people talking about moving to this country because they thought that the streets were paved with gold, right ? And our transp ortation system used to be the envy of the world, up until a very recent time . But in a very short period of time, it has changed dramatically . Now, many of you have probably flown internationally, right? If you fly into Newark or LAX from Mumbai, Dubai, Shanghai, right, are you flying into an airport that shouts, American primacy ? Or are you thinking that the infrastructure I left was actually kind of nicer than the one we have here ? And that has profound impacts for our country . And it's something we need to consider when we think about, well that's tough -- it's a tough vote to take . We used to be able to build great things in this country . But in the last few years, this partisan politics has frozen our ability to raise the gas tax o r do much of anything. You know, but to those who say that this is a partisan issue, you know, transportation used to be a bipartisan rallying cry . Even Libertarians could point to the words of Adam Smith who said, in ""The Wealth of Nations,"" that infras tructure was one of the few things that governments should invest in. Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of the Republican P arty, raised the gas tax . And he said, in 1982, ""We simply cannot allow this magnificent system to deteriorate beyond repair . The bridges and haze we fail to repair today will have to be rebuilt tomorrow at many times the cost."" It was true in '82, and it's true today . But I would close with the words of Adrian Moore, who is across the stage tonight, who, after participating in that commission which recommended a 10 -state gas tax increase, in 2009, said, ""I'm not excited about a gas tax increase, but the reality is, our current gas tax doesn't pay for the upkeep of the system . We can either let the roads go to hell, or we can pay more in gas tax."" So join me, join Alison, and join Adrian . ",
against," Well, thanks a lot . I didn't know it was three against one -- -- but it's great to be here . Look, I am pro roads. I am pro bridges, I am pro highways, I am pro electric grid, I am pro infrastructure, I'm pro cars, and I’m pro growth. So I don't think there's any of us who would disagree . We do need a renovation, a modernization of our transportation system in this c ountry. There's no question about it. I think we would all agree with that. The question is really how best do we fund that. And I would make the argument that instead of raising the gas -- federal gasoline tax -- we should,we should reduce the fe deral gasoline tax. And what we ought to do is use the -- lower the federal gasoline tax from 18 cents a gallon to somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 cents a gallon to pay for the interstate highway . But look, there's -- you're exactly right . There's 42 ,000 miles of interstate highways in this country . It's one of the great triumphs of our country . But you know what? The interstate highway system was completed many, many, many years ago . It was completed in the mid-1980s . Now it's basically a system that just needs to be kept up . We need to continue to fix potholes and so on . But that's a lot cheaper than it is to build the system in the first place . So what I'm going to do is devote about 5 cents of federal gasoline tax to modernizing our interstate highway system . And the rest of the money, reduce the federal gasoline tax and let every state raise its gas tax as is appropriate . So in Colorado, you could raise your gas tax to pay for your roads . In Illinois, my home state, we -- we pay for the projects that we want to . And this gets to the point that Robert -- that Bob Rosenkranz made, which is that the gas tax is -- I agree with him. It's an efficient tax . It's not as efficient as we would like . There's probably better ways now to finance -- finance roads than the gas tax, but it's a pretty good user fee system . But it's not a very good user fee system if I have to pay a gas tax living in Virginia to pay for roads and transit projects and other things in California. It doesn't make sense . The people in California should pay for those . And that's what I would -- would favor . And by the way, many states, it is true that the federal gasoline tax has not been raised in many, many years, but states do raise their gas tax as voters demand better roads and so on. By the way, there are also times when voters say we don't want to raise the gas tax . So in Michigan, for example, there was a major -- a referendum about 18 months ago where they were going to raise the gas tax for roads and other projects . And it was -- it was defeated 80 -20 . The voters said no, we don't want to pay higher gas taxes . Gas taxes come right out of the pocketbook of Americans . And every time you raise the federal gasoline tax by 1 p enny, it takes a billion dollars, $1million out of pockets of consumers . So I would say that there's a couple of other inefficiencies with the federal gas tax, that if we get rid of these inefficiencies, we wouldn't have to raise the gas tax at all. For -- the most important one that we need to -- the most problem we need to readdress right now is that when you pay your federal gaso line tax, many of you are probab ly not aware of this, but only about 75 cents of every dollar you pay in federal gasoline taxes goes to paying for roads and bridges and highways .  That's a small -- what happens to the other 25 cents, right? And t he answer is, the other 25 cents goes to other types of systems that have nothing to do with roads and bridges and highways that people use -- use the highway system. So a big percentage of that goes to transit projects . Now, look, you have transit . New York City is one of the few places in America where actually transit probably does make sense . I'm from Washingt on, D.C. where transit makes sense . But most -- most other industries, transit is extraordinarily inefficient . More people in this country walk to work than use transit. So it's not a very good system of transporting people from one destination to another . And even if it is, the people who use the transit system should pay for the transit through the fees that they pay and the -- the costs of riding the system . There's cer tainly no reason why somebody who's driving their car should have to pay for people who use transit. And if we do that -- and, by the way, there's also a lot of this money that gets intercepted by just ridiculous projects . I mean, I live in Virginia where we built a -- an extension of our transit project out to Dulles Airport. I don't know many -- how you get out there . It is probably the most absurd transportation project in American history . Nobody's riding it. It cost $6 billion . For one tenth of the cost, we could have built just one more lane of highway and we could have gotten rid of all the congestion problems . You also have things like the California train to nowhere that probably many of you are aware of . It's a $70 billion project . Very few people are going to ride this train. It's paid for with federal money, and there's no way California would have ever paid for it if the people who -- in California had to pay for it themselves . But they said, ""Yeah, let's build this because we're going to get money from other states."" Those are inefficiencies. And when I'm -- what I was telling you is that if we simply devoted every single penny of federal gasoline tax at 18 cents a gallon to building roads, we wouldn't have a problem -- we wouldn't have any of the problems that you just heard about. That's all we have to do. And this gets to the user pays idea . People who use roads should pay for them, andthey should pay for them through the federal gasoline tax, but people who are using the roads shouldn't have to pay for other things that the y're not using. One of the things that you brought up was efficiency . And I just did a big study comparing Texas and California and the way that they spend money . And it turns out there is actually massive inefficiency in the way roads or bridges -- roa ds are built in this country . And it has to do a lot of -- with, you know, labor laws, environmental laws, and things like that . But let me just give you an example . So in Texas it costs about $100,000 per mile to build or repair a road, $100,000 a mile . In California, where you were from, it costs 250,000 to $300,000. It costs two to three times more to build a mile of highway . So I would submit to you there are a lot of ways to sweat out inefficiencies and cost excesses, and it would be more likely to happen if states had to pay for it themselves than if they got federal money. There's one other bugaboo out there that needs to be addressed, and that is if we were to repeal something called the Davis -Bacon Act -- which is a law that requires kind of a super minimum wage that's paid on roads projects, it's essentially a law that benefits the unions . I f we were to simply allow these projects to be competitively bid, we could substantially reduce the cost of federal road building . And if we did that -- let me put it very simply -- if we simply get rid of Davis -Bacon Act, for every four bridges that we build now, we get a fifth one for free . We get a fifth one for free. For every highways we build, for every four roads that we build, we g et a fifth one for free. Why wouldn't we want to do that? And before we do things like raise people's taxes, why don't we do things like repeal the Davis -Bacon Act that will make roads more efficient ? And, finally, we are moving into a new age of transp ortation, and that new age is going to involve things like the Google car, and it's going to involve things like tol ling and things like that that are going to make, and, in my opinion, the gas tax obsolete . It's not -- -- it's not going to be a good way to fund roads any longer . So thank you very much.",1.0
for," I think if we're going to have a debate about raising the federal gas tax and asking the users to pay more, we also have to talk about the benefits that they'll get from that increase in investment in our highway and bridge program as well as the challenges we're going to face as a country if we do not make those needed investments . So raising the federal gas tax means increasing investment to repair and reconstruc t the highways and bridges that are the backbone of our economy . It also means increasing investment in transit which provides mobility choices to millions of Americans every day and also gets cars off of our congested roadways . It also means raising -- or increasing employment and economic output in every state as well as most importantly we're also talking about saving lives . Roadway conditions are a factor in about a third of all highway fatalities in this country . And when we make investments to imp rove our roads and bridges, we significantly can help reduce that number . So I want to talk tonight about how the National Transportation System is the foundation of our economy and why federal investment is so important to that, and how the federal gas t ax is also a sustainable source of revenue over the next 10 to 20 years. And when we're talking about investing in our federal highway system, these are the roads and bridges that are key to our national economy . We're not talking about filling a pothole in your neighborhood street. This is investment that has to go towards our interstate highway system, our national highway system, the roads that connect our airports, our ports, and those highways that make just -in -time delivery possible . So, these are the major roads . And just to give you an idea of how important that national system is to our entire economy, over half of all the sea -borne cargo in the United States comes through two ports: the port of Los Angeles and the port of Long Beach. Now, about 23 percent of those goods are going to stay in Southern California . But the rest of them are shipped to every state in the country . They go by rail. They also go bytruck . And in this country, over 70 percent of all our freight is shipped by truck, so that national system is absolutely essential to getting goods and services across our country into the economy that we have . The federal program is extremely important as well, because it ensure that states are making investments in that national system. Twenty-five percent of the roads in this country are eligible for federal aid for the program that we're talking about that's supported by the federal gas tax . But those roads carry 85 percent of our total traffic . And in terms of how states are spending their money, the Government Accountability Office did a study last year, where they looked at state program spending of their federal dollars . Ninety percent of the money was going towards capital outlays and safety impr ovements. And capital outlays are construction, right of way, and engineering . So, states are making significant investments . And they get to choose which projects -- where their money is going . The federal gas tax is also a sustainable revenue source over the next 10 to 20 years. Now, total volume of traffic in this country is going to be growing by about 1 percent a year . That's the forecast from the U.S . Energy Information Administration . Now, while cars are becoming more fuel -efficient , overall, what matters for the federal gas tax and the money raised is the total volume of fuel that we're consuming in this country . So, even though cars are becoming more fuel efficient, people are driving more . So, those two things are going to offse t each other. And the forecast is that our fuel consumption, while it is going down, it's by about half a percent to 1 percent a year. So, that is a very manageable small change . We're not going see wild swings in fuel consumption because of more fuel e fficient cars, even though our fleet is turning over gradually . When you look at state spending on all of those capital outlays I mentioned, which, again, construction, right of way, and engineering -- federal money accounts for, on average, 52 percent of that spending. The federal aid program is absolutely crucial to what is actually getting designed, what is getting built, and all those right of way purchases to make those roads and those widening projects happen. And in some states, it is as high as 80 percent. And we have done the work where we look at those audited statements in the state budgets . Some states take their federal money -- which, there's an 80/20 match. They match it, and that is their entire capital program . Even states like California and Texas, that we're talking about tonight -- and again, we have done these reports . Nearly half of all the construction spending in those states, for highways and bridges, comes from the federalaid program. And you think about how impor tant those states are to our economy . That federal investment is key. And right now, this is -- and that's why the structure of the federal program is so important, because states have to invest money on those key corridors that are part of that national economy -- those roads that are carrying 85 percent of our traffic, that are getting goods from the port of LA or Seattle, or New York, to all the store shelves where we go to buy the latest gadgets . And we are in danger . If we do not raise the federal gas tax, we are not investing enough -- as my partner describes . And we are going to leave a system for future generations that is an economic drag, that's not fair . We've inherited a great system. And we owe it to our children and the next generation that we make the investments, and that we pay for them -- that we're not bonding and using debt, and we're using a straightforward way, increasing the user fee to pay for the system. And I would also add that people really value their mobility in this country . We did some polling last year. They were not asking the right questions . It's not, ""Do you want to pay more in a gas tax?"" It's ""what are the benefits? What are you getting out of that investment?"" And we found that 75 to 80 percent of Americans told us that they value their mobility and their transportation system as much as their cell phone, their internet, their electricity, things that we use every day and that we just can't imagine living without . But there's a disc onnect for folks understanding exactly what they pay for it. And for that reason, and many others as we've described, we urge you to support raising the gas tax so we can make those needed investments to help support our economy.",1.0
against,"Well, I, too, thank all of you for coming out . We really appreciate it. I got to start with Shailen's quote . I am often asked in these interviews to say, ""Well, what does the o ther side say?"" And that quote was exactly what it said . ""What does the other side say?"" I say ""They say you either raise taxes or you let the roads go to hell."" So it wasn't actually a quote from me, but I have never advocated that solution. But, you know, look, the one thing we all agree on is that this infrastructure is crucial. It's economically indisputable that it's central to -- to our economy. I mean, if -- if it wasn't for transportation, we would all be making our own clothes, gro wing our own food. You know, it'd be subsistence living, right ? So transportation is crucial. The debate here is, is the best way to fund the transportation we need in the future to just simply tax people for more money to go into the existing system or is it to figure out if we're making the best use of the money ? And really, what Steve and I are arguing is that we think there's a lot that can be done with the money that's already being taxed before we have to raise those taxes . You know, we all -- look there's a lot of poster children for this problem . The bridge to nowhere probably being the single most famous one . You know, when you -- the -- when the system of allocating money is politicized, you will inevitably get money spent on pro jects that don't make a wit of sense . And that's not what happens to most of the money, but it only takes a little bit of that before people start to question the legitimacy of the money that's already there, let alone the legitimacy of giving more money into a system that builds bridge to nowhere . There is a -- a fundamental question, I think, of, are we getting the bang for the buck that we should be getting from these systems ? A nd I think it's also important to realize how much our priori ty for transportation has changed. If you look at state budgets from the 1960s, you'll see not only were they collecting gas taxes and were there federal gas taxes being spent to build the interstate system still in the '60s, but still under construction, but large chunks in every state of general fund revenues went to transportation. At that point in time, states were funding far fewer things, and transportation was considered very important. That's long gone . Starting about 25 years ago, states basically eliminated most of their general fund spending on transportation and started relying more and more on the federal government to give them the money for their local and state projects rather than funding it themselves . Which is more of a problem today because so much of what we need now that the interstate system is largely built out, is new projects that are primarily state and local in nature . Steve mentioned this as well. They may carry some interstate traffic, but on every interstate in America, most of the traffic is local. Most of the benefits of any new project are local, and the side benefits are -- are the national trade, the truck traffic that moves the cargo around the country . So why shouldn't the funding of those projects be at least predominantly local? It's not entirely local for a great many of these projects . The notion that it's easy to lobby the federal government to raise its gas tax and get the free money from Washington than it is to convince your own citizens to vote yes to on a gas tax has really taken over in a lot of states . And it engenders a culture of, why don't we have other people pay for the things that we need? There's a lot of ways to get more bang for the buck. You know, Steve just gave the California- Texas example, which there is sort of like a cottage industry of comparing California and Texas in lots of things . Having lived in California, I saw a lot of that . But just across the board, if you look at how much it costs each of the 50 states to maintain and build roads, there is it a huge spread where you've got the least efficient states are spending orders four or five, six times as much as the most efficient states . And the least efficient states are not trying to figure out what they're doing wrong . They're not -- they just want more money . They're not trying to figure out how -- how can we build roads for the same price that the 10 most efficient states are ? There's none of that going on. And I publish a report every ye ar that makes that comparison . And I ask the bottom 10 states, are you going to try to move into the top 10 ? And they just say, ""No, your report's bogus because you can't compare states."" So, you know, on it goes . There are many ways, though, to get mo re bang for the buck . We see in Europe and Asia wide use of tolling and public -private partnerships to sort of back -fill the user pays principle that the gas tax served so well for so long . It's -- it's -- there are ways of building more with the existing revenue that we don't seem to want to touch very much in this country . Now, I will say Colorado relatively, in the top handful of states in terms of using those kind of tools . But the vast majority of states don't use those tools and therefore spend a lot more than they need to because it's easier to ask you for more money than it is to get more efficient . And finally, I think there's too much funding of things that people don't use . And there's a lot of ways to slice this, and I don't w ant to get into all of it right now. But you know, there's -- there are real fairness issues . You know, a Prius uses exactly the same amount of road to do a 25 -mile -a -day commute as a Lincoln Town c ar does . But a Lincoln Townc ar is paying many multiple s more in gas tax than that Prius is, but not getting any more benefit from it. So while there's many great things about Prius and electric cars, there is a problem that they are not paying for the roads that they're using with a gas tax system . And as that technology continues to advance, and as all of our cars get more fuel efficient, all of us are going to be paying less for using more roads that are more expensive to build . And that's not a sustainable system . We should be focusing more on the performance of the projects we build, not the political popularity of the projects we build, which tends to drive a lot of the allocation of resources, especially in Congress at the federal level, not so much at the state level where things are a little closer to the road, so to speak . And Steve mentioned the disparate problem of transit spending . I can't break that all down, but let's just say that the bottom -- the 20 percent poorest population in the U.S . is much more -- many more of them get to work by bumming a ride from a friend who has a car than by riding transit . People in New York don't realize what an aberration New York is in terms of public transit -- -- to the rest of the country.",1.0
against,"Well, you know, I don't actually see the similarity . I don't think there's any argument among any of us that if you're talking about the interstate highway system that connects us all, that should be paid for with federal dollars because it is a national project. What we're talking about is most of the money that's now collected in the federal gasoline tax -- which is why it should be largely repealed and turned back to the states and let them raise their taxes because most of the money is for local roads -- and those roads, as Adrian said, the -- 80 to 90 per cent of the users are local. So the people whouse it should pay for it. And just one last point, I mean, if you want to see the inefficiency -- there are so many examples of this, but you did mention the bridge to nowhere -- the bri dge to nowhere in Alaska -- I wrote for the Wall Street Journal -- -- but this is my -- this is related to this because -- -- the reason the bridge to nowhere was built is -- and, by the way, this is a project literally that was going to save sort of like 50 people and it cost like 400 -- I forget the number -- $400 million -- yes, people in Alaska never would have paid for that, but it was paid for with federal gasoline dollars. So my point is, I mean, that's an extreme example, but there are a lot of projects that are being built right now, especially transit projects, nobody would ever build -- -- except for they're built by people -- they're paid for by people who aren't going to use it.",2.0
for,"So I'll just start really quickly.John Donvan: Shailen Bhatt. I think your defense analogy is a great one, and that's why Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations said that there are certain public goods for which individuals cannot pay and, in self -interest, would not pay a lot more . And so I agree from a self -interest standpoint Seattle could say, ""Well, we can rais e a lot of money ourselves,"" or Utah can say, ""We're going to raise a lot of money ourselves,"" and that would lead to a balkanization of transportation . You would get states that are hav es and have nots . I think the other -- I think the other analogy here is the Northeast Corridor. There is $50 billion of deferred maintenance because nobody wants to pay for it along the Northeast Corridor. This is why you have delays in trains in the New York City area. This is why people sit in trains for a long period of time . And no state is going to step up and say, ""Sure, tax us."" Of course we need a federal government to step in and provide that funding . So to me of course locals don't want to pay for things necessarily that benefit the nation, but there are national interests, an interstate system, a northeast corridor, and defense, like you mentioned, that I think raise to that level.",2.0

And we already know that gas taxes are not very popular, so you could literally end up with a situation where we'd lose $600 million a year of our federal funding that would go to our roadways b ecause the people have spoken, and it's not popular . Now, that would mean that Colorado, as compared to Utah, which is a pretty enlightened red state, that invests massive amounts of money in infrastructure and has very little traffic and great roadways w ould turn into a ""have"" state and a high population state like Colorado would be left without.

And I'm saying that in my experience in running two of these state DOTs we've done a lot of these things and there is still a shortfall . And I want to close with a story. So in 1988 my dad took us back to India . I was born in Canada. My dad decided to take us to India . He took us for a lot of reasons, but I think he wanted to impress upon us how lucky we were to grow up in the first world . And my memory of that visit in 1988 is landing at this airport in Ahmedabad, India . And it -- going to the airport, it was like this single -story structure with bars in the window instead of glass and bouncing around on these roadways around the state of G ujarat that were two lanes and were likely the relics of the B ritish colonization . And it wasn't a pretty sight in 1988 . I went back representing the Federal Highway Administration in 2010, and that single -story airport was this modern gleaming glass and steel structure which is probably the nicest airport I've ever been in, in the entire world . And those two -lane roads, th ey've been replaced by four -lane roads that are carrying goods and services around India. India, China, Brazil, the EU, they're all making significant investments in their transportation system, not because they want to compare to us but because they want to compete with us . And there are -- there's a global war for jobs right now . And our transportation system in the 20th century provided a backbone for this country's economy . We inherited that system . We have not invested in that system, an d that system is failing . We owe it to the children that are here tonight, we owe it to the children of the people who are listening to turn over to them a system that will allow them to compete in the 21st century . And that is why we should follow the words of Ronald Reagan, we should follow the words of Adrian Moore -- -- we should follow the words of our side, and call for a 10 cent increase in the gas tax . It is not popular, but it is the right thing to do. It is our duty. Please join us in this. ",3.0

You know, look, we all agree we have these big needs . Shailen quoted our report that looked at how much transportation infrastructure we're going to need in the future and did not conclude that we need to raise the gas tax, but instead looked at how we can pay for building all of that with more sensible means . So the question really is, ""Is the best thing to do in the face of more infrastructure needs to tax everybody more and continue to do things the way they've always been done, or is the best way to figure out how can we do be tter at providing this infrastructure with the money that we're already collecting?"" You know, we're getting more for our phone purchase, more for our computer purchase, more for our home purchase, more for everything we buy . We should be getting more from our transportation system, too. So we don't need to raise the federal gas tax to get more . We need to focus on getting more bang for the buck, so to speak. S tephen Moore : That's we’re “M oore .” Yes, that's right . I submit that most people -- most of you don't have any idea how much you pay per year in gas tax . Most people in America don't. We've done a lot of survey and man -on -the -street kind of interviews . The people's beliefs about what they pay in gas tax varies widely . People don't know. They don't know where the money goes . They don't have a lot of trust in the system . We should be focusing on getting that understanding, getting that transparency, getting that willingness to invest in the system before we take the money . And, finally, should we be doubling down on a system that was invented before World War II when technology is changing so fast? Should we increase funding in a system that is so ancient and rapidly becoming obsolete, or should we focus those energies instead on figuring out, ""How do we fund the future transportation with a future transportation funding mechanism, not just throwing more money into the same old system?""",3.0
for,"The challenge is that as users of the system we are going to pay for it one way or another . We will either decide to increase the gas tax, make the investment that way, improve our road and bridge systems, or we will pay for it by sitting in congestion, paying more for our goods and services . And what struck me -- last year I did a report on New Jersey, and, you know, I work with a lot of numbers, and I was trying t o quantify in some way -- New Jersey's average commute time is 10 minutes higher than the national average . And that really got me to thinking because I've been with ARTBA for 15 years . And during that time, my commute has gone up, easily, by 10 minutes each way . And when I added that up, that is 40 hours a year . And as I said, I worked with a lot of numbers, but that really struck me . I have four young kids at home . I would gladly pay 25 cents a day, which is the cost of raising the federal gas tax by 15 cents to the average driver. We are talking about a quarter a day . I would gladly pay that, and much more, if it meant that I had to spend less time commuting in traffic and more time with my family or doing whatever I would choose to do .

The unions were there. All of the group s that basically get this money that wanted it because this is what enriches their coffers . And what was interesting about that was none of these groups talked any -- not one iota -- and in fact, I'd say this about our opponents on this -- have they mentioned one way that we could be more efficient in the way that we spend our dollars ?  I mean, it's all -- basically, the line of all the gr oups that were for more gas taxes -- “Give us more money.” More money, more money, more money . No talk about how to make it more efficient, how to make it more effective . “We want to spend more and tax more.” And I would submit to you, that approach, in every area in Washington is what has created a bloated federal system that's borrowing nearly a trillion dollars a year andbankrupting our country . As far as this point about reducing congestion -- Alison, I too face a long commu te. I live in Washington D.C., as you do . If I believed -- if I sincerely believed that raising the gas tax by five or 10 cents a gallon was going to reduce congestion in Washington D.C., I'd come over there and hug you and I would say, “Hell yes, I'm go ing to pay that money.” But I have no faith whatsoever that this money that we're going to raise in the federal gasoline tax is going to reduce congestion, because it just hasn't done it before . We're not very efficient in spending it. And th e final point I'll make -- as I made this point before -- we can get an extra bridge . We get an extra road built for every four we build by just getting rid of the Davis Bacon Act . So, we get rid of that, we have less congestion . We have a better transportation infrastructure system . Let's start by doing that.",3.0
