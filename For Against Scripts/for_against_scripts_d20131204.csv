for,"Thank you. Gene will be talking about the ethical and environmental issues. I'm going to talk about health. In 2009, the Archives of Internal Medicine published a massive research study. The NIH-AARP study had a half a million participants. They were followed for 10 years. Some of them didn't eat meat or didn't eat very much. Some ate quite a lot of meat. And what they showed was that among those eating the most meat, the risk of dying of cancer was increased by fully 20 percent and heart disease deaths were increased by 27 percent among men and 50 percent among women. And in 2012, the Archives of Internal Medicine published another study. One hundred and twenty thousand people. This was coordinated all at Harvard University. And itshowed exactly the same thing: if you ate a lot of meat, your risk of dying of heart disease was much higher; your risk of dying of cancer was higher. And studies have clearly shown that people who don't eat meat cut their cancer risk by anywhere between 12 and 40 percent. Well, why would meat be linked to cancer? Hold that thought for a second. I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and I come from a long line of cattle ranchers. My dad raised cattle, my grandpa raised cattle, as far back as I can trace. Now, my dad did not like the cattle business. He objected to it a great deal. He went to medical school. He spent his life treating diabetes in Fargo, North Dakota. But we still ate like we were in the cattle business. Every day it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn, except for special occasions when it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas. And my grandfather had a heart attack, and he then became quite severely demented, and he died. And we took that as normal because he was old. He was 65. My other three grandparents lived longer, but each one of them succumbed to severe dementia year after year after year, and they all finally died. And none of us thought that maybe food had something to do with this. Now, I got my first wake-up call at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis, where I was the autopsy assistant. One day a man died in a hospital of a massive heart attack, probably from eating hospital food, but that's another story. And the pathologist came in the room, and he knew that I was headed for medical school. So he removed a section of ribs, and he sliced open one of the coronary arteries, and he said, ""Look inside."" And it looked like chewing gum in this coronary artery, but when I felt it, it was hard like a rock. And he said, ""That's atherosclerosis. That's your morning sausage, Neal. That's your bacon, Neal. That's your roast beef in there."" And he said, ""We see the beginnings of this in three quarters of people by age 23,"" which happened to be the age I was at the time. And he wrote up all his findings. He left the room. And I had to clean up. I took the ribs. I put them back in the chest. I tried to make them fit with the other ribs. And I sewed up the skin, cleaned up, and I went up to the cafeteria, where they were serving ribs for lunch. Now, fast forwarding a little bit, a little -- a few years later Dr. Dean Ornish brought in to a research study people who had atherosclerosis, they had narrowed arteries, he took the meat out of their diets, and something happened that had never been shown before. The arteries actually started opening up again, so much that you could see a measurable difference in 82 percent of patients in the first year with no surgery and no medications. Grass-fed beef does not do that, including the beef my family raised. It just doesn't work. Eating chicken and eating fish just can't do that. And so my research team tried this same kind of diet for people who wanted to lose weight, and NIH funded us to try this kind of diet for people who had diabetes. And it works better than any other diet. Why? Because when you get meat out of the diet, meat has fat in it and every gram of fat has nine calories. That's its job. You get it out of the diet, and you get rid of a lot of calories. Meat has zero fiber, none. Fiber fills you up without calories, and if the foods you have don’t have it, you’re going to eat too much, and you’re going to gain weight. Why diabetes? Because getting the meat out of the diet helps fat to drain out of the muscle cells, allowing insulin to start working on its own. And we saw something I never saw in medical school, which is diabetes improving, sometimes even disappearing for all intents and purposes. And when we look at broad population studies, the meat-eaters are always the heaviest group, and the people who eat no meat are always the thinnest. Diabetes is the same way. =t’s about 8 percent of adult meat-eaters, and among vegetarians, 3 percent. High blood pressure, exactly the same. You just don’t see it very much in people following vegetarian diets. But why more cancer? Well, when we heat up meat, something happens that doesn’t happen with plant foods, and that’s that carcinogens called heterocyclic amines form in the meat, especially chicken, but any kind of skeletal muscle, which is what meat is. But that’s not the only carcinogen. We also see polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, there’s heme iron, there are a lot of things. Plus meat doesn’t have fiber that protects you. =t doesn’t have any vitamin C. It’s low in important antioxidants. So it’s like tobacco. We know for sure tobacco causes lung cancer, but we’re not 100 percent sure which part of the tobacco smoke is responsible. We know clearly that meat causes cancer in other parts of your body. The stomach, the intestinal tract -- but we’re not sure. =s it the :CAs? The PA:s? We’re not quite sure yet. I asked Dr. Richard Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist, how did we get into meat-eating? And he said humans are naturally primates. We’re great apes. We are not carnivores, and we ate things we could pick with our hands, until the Stone Age gave us stone tools, and meat-eating began, he believes, as scavenging. Lying with leafs and bones, we would scrape it up with these stone tools that we now had. Problem: we have pre-Stone Age bodies that get cancer and get heart disease when you eat meat. Of course, if your life expectancy is 35 or 40, it doesn’t matter, but if you live to a mid-age and beyond, then these things matter a lot. And what matters now is Alzheimer’s disease. We have now learned that a diet high in saturated fat -- that’s the bad fat in meat -- is linked to Alzheimer’s disease in studies in Chicago, in New York, in Finland. And meat-eaters actually have very poor nutrition. Yes, they get protein, but they don’t get many vitamins, they don’t get any complex carbohydrates, they’re missing fiber. A vegetarian diet gives you all the protein you’re going to need, plus many more vitamins, many more minerals. So Bill Clinton did. Al Gore did it. Bob Barker did it. Serena Williams did it. Since 2004 meat-eating has dropped by 9 percent. That’s where we’re going. That’s the future. Thank you very much.",nan
against,"First, thank you to everyone involved tonight for providing us with an opportunity to debate this issue in such an excellent forum. And John, every time that I buy meat, I always think about the conditions the cow was raised in. Tonight my partner Joel Salatin and I will urge you to vote against the motion, ""Don’t Eat Anything with a Face."" =’d like to begin by telling you a personal story. When I was 18, I became a vegetarian, because I believed that this would be the most healthful, ethical, and ecologically conscious dietary choice I could make. Six monthslater I became a vegan, meaning I excluded all animal products from my diet. After all, I had to follow the inevitable conclusion of my own logic. All animals die regardless of whether we kill them, and what I opposed most strongly was the cruelty and abuse seen in the industrial factory farm, which is often worse for laying hens and dairy cows than it is for animals raised for meat. =’m sure that my opponent, Gene, will explain some of this abuse to you later tonight. A year and a half down the road, it became clearer and clearer that my dietary journey through vegetarianism and veganism was failing to bring me into any promised land of vibrant health. Many pre-existing health problems, that had mostly been a nuisance to me in the past, devolved into burdens that crippled my day-to-day function. My digestion worsened, my energy tanked, and my irritability skyrocketed. Intense exercise began giving my anxiety and heart palpitations. In a single dental examination, I found out that I had over a dozen cavities and needed two root canals. Worst of all, my anxiety disorders aggravated to the point that I had several panic attacks per week and was often afraid to eat my own food or even begin driving my own car. But then I encountered the work of Weston Price, which really changed my life. Weston Price was the first research director for what became the American Dental Association and was a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology. He documented -- all over the globe, in different climates, in different altitudes and latitudes, in groups with radically different cultural and genetic backgrounds -- the consistent effects of the nutritional transition from traditional diets to what he called the “displacing foods of modern commerce”: white flower, white sugar, white rice, vegetable oils, and canned goods. In every case, the transition was one from radiant and vibrant health to not only tooth decay and dental deformities, but often to tuberculosis, cancer, ulcers, appendicitis, cystitis, gallbladder disease, physical degeneration of all kinds. All of the groups that successfully maintained vibrant health on their traditional diets placed special emphasis on the need for animal products rich in fat-soluble vitamins. Some groups emphasized dairy products, others emphasized organ meats and egg yolks, others the animal life of the sea, and yet others small animals and insects. Price went on to provide laboratory and clinical evidence that the emphasis on these foods was in fact a critical reason for the success of these traditional diets. After reading Price's work, I began emphasizing high-quality, nutrient-dense animal foods in my own diet, and within months my anxiety disorders completely disappeared,and my tooth decay came to a crashing halt. I truly felt like a new person. Indeed, my mental and physical health had undergone a revolution. My experience raises two questions: First, am I alone in it? And second, what happened to me and why? The scientific literature shows that I'm not alone. Seven out of eight relevant studies found that compared to omnivores, vegetarians have a greater risk of mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, poor self-esteem, anxiety, and contemplated or attempted suicide. A study published in 2010 found that compared to omnivores, vegans had eight times more lesions involving poor mineralization of the teeth. Why might this be? Well, simply put, many nutrients are much easier to get from animal products than from plant products. Perhaps the most underappreciated of these is cholesterol. Many people are aware that high cholesterol is associated with heart disease. But few people are aware that low cholesterol is associated with mental disorders, violent and self-injurious behavior, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and increased total mortality. Dr. Barnard himself has published scientific papers showing that, although his diet leads to increased intakes of many nutrients, primarily from fruits and vegetables, it also leads to decreased intakes of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and selenium, and fails to guarantee an adequate intake of zinc. Dr. Barnard recommends supplementing with vitamin B12 and vitamin D and emphasizing vegan foods rich in zinc, but the foods richest in zinc aren't vegan at all. They're oysters, beef, and cheese. It is unlikely that supplementing our way out of these nutrient deficiencies, moreover, will be a complete success, because all of these nutrients have very complex interactions with the other components present in the foods in which we find them. Vitamin B12, for example, synergizes with key amino acids found most abundantly in meat, bones, and skin. Is it possible to design an adequate diet that does not include the meat of animals with faces? I actually think that it is. It would include egg yolks, dairy products and shellfish. Shellfish are neither vegan nor vegetarian, after all; they're animals. But many people might argue, perhaps correctly, that they don't have faces. Such a diet, however, would not be adequate for everyone. Let me provide, by way of example for now, just one reason why: Vitamin A. Vitamin A is found most abundantly in liver and cod liver oil or the liver oils of other fishes, while more moderate amounts are found in egg yolks and butter fat. Red, orange, yellow and green vegetables provide carotenoids such as beta-carotene which we can convert into vitamin A. However, the efficiency of this conversion is relatively poor and highly variable. Half of people with European ancestry have a genetic variant that cuts their ability to make the conversion in half, and a third, other variant that cuts it fourfold. These people are extremely unlikely to get enoughvitamin A from plant foods alone and would do best if they included liver or cod liver oil in their diet which are derived from animals with faces. In order to construct an optimal dietary approach that is robust to error and adaptable to individual needs, we need to abandon the false dichotomy between healthy plant foods and supposedly unhealthy animal foods, and instead embrace the health value of high-quality, nutrient-dense foods of all types. Fortunately, animal foods are highest in quality and richest in nutrients when the animals are raised in an ethical and ecologically conscious manner, with high-quality soil, out on pasture in the fresh air and sunshine. My partner Joel Salatin will explain more about how this is done and will conclude our opening argument for why you should vote against this motion.",1.0
for,"Thank you very much, and thank you for this opportunity. It's wonderful to be discussing this issue. Most people don't think enough about our food choices and about the animals who suffer terribly for the meat, milk and eggs that is produced in this country. I grew up eating animals without really thinking about it. My parents ate animals, my brothers and sisters ate animals. Everybody around me was doing it, so I just adopted the habit, without really thinking about it. But as I started learning about the fact of how these animals were treated and about the fact that I could live well without eating animals, I made the choice to become a vegan. I did that back in 1985.It's one of the best choices I've ever made. And the fact that we can live well without eating other animals, without causing harm, I think is the key question here, the key point. If we can live well without causing harm, why wouldn't we do it? And the main reason is that we just sort of grow up doing it, without thinking about it. So, the question is, how can we live well? How do we want to feel when we treat other animals the way we treat them? And on these factory farms, they're treated horribly. I visited farms across the country. I've seen animals put in these small cages where they can't move. You walk into these farms, and you're hit with this horrible stench. They're living in their feces. They're screaming to get out of their cages, and they live that way their whole lives, and then they're killed young so that we can eat them. And, you know, when people see this, they don't like it. And oftentimes people say, ""Don't tell me. I don't want to know,"" when the issue of factory farming comes up, because it is so upsetting and because we are compassionate, and because we are hardwired to have empathy. When we look at other animals, and we see them suffer, when we look at other people, and we see them suffer, we feel something. That is one of the best parts of our humanity, this empathy, this ability to feel something when we look into somebody else's face. When the executioners at the Salem witch hunts were charged with killing witches, they were told, “Don't look into their face, because if you do, they'll cast a spell on you, and you won't be able to kill them.” Basically, when you look into their face, there's empathy, there's a connection, there's an understanding that there's a living creature there. And when you abuse another animal or another person for that matter, there's this tendency to try to denigrate them and to say, well, they don't really have feelings. They don't really deserve any better. And that's unfortunately what has happened to farm animals. There are these misconceptions and incorrect ideas about animals on farms not being smart. For instance, people think turkeys are so dumb they'll go outside and they'll drown in the rain. This is one of these myths that people say, probably to feel better about mistreating animals. But we've raised turkeys at Farm Sanctuary for many years. They go outside. They've never gone out and drowned in the rain. They enjoy, you know, going indoors and outdoors. And when the animals come to us, they're often afraid because they've only known cruelty. But when they startrecognizing they're in a safe place, and they start being treated with kindness, they respond. And it's a beautiful thing to see. We had a turkey at our farm in California we used to call Lydia the Hugging Turkey, because you'd go out into the barnyard and kneel down, and she would come up to you, and she would crane her neck around your neck like she was giving you a hug. So these animal show companionship and friendship. And I'm not the only one that has seen this. People who visit Farm Sanctuary and work there have seen this. Jane Goodall, also, is now speaking out about the fact that these animals have feelings and much more intellectual and emotional depth than we ever knew before. She said, ""Farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined. They are individuals in their own right."" Now, on factory farms, these animals are treated horribly. I think there is widespread support among this panel even among those who think that it's okay to eat animals, that factory farming is an abomination, that it should not occur. It is outside the bounds of acceptable conduct. The real challenge is discussing, what about animals who are not treated so badly? Should we eat them? And I would suggest, no, we should not. We do not need to. We do not need to cause them harm. And whenever animals are seen as consumable products, there is a tendency to treat them not very well. I've been to factory farms, I have been to small farms, and even on these farms that are purported to be humane, there are significant problems. Whenever the animals are seen as consumables, the relationship is one of exploitation, and that is a huge problem that we need to face, and something we don't need to do. In addition, animal production is very wasteful. The United Nations came out with a report a couple years ago talking about how animal agriculture is one of the top contributors to the most serious environmental problems we're facing on the planet, including climate change. And these animals are routinely fed antibiotics as well, so we have these antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are now developing on these farms. And so these are other problems associated with this attitude of looking at animals just as commodities. So, eating animals is bad for the animals. It is bad for the environment. It is bad for us. It is not necessary. We can live and be healthy on eating plants alone. I urge you to vote yes on the motion that we should not eat anything with a face. So thank you very much.",1.0
against,"We're going to have an interesting evening since potatoes have eyes. Corn has ears. Cabbages have heads. And, goodness, what are we going to do about those navel oranges? Eating things with faces is great, so I'm happy with our negative position. Chris and I have some overarching positions. Number one: affirmative studies, affirmative studies impugning animal farming or omnivorous nutrition must be based on pasture-based data, not chemical, pharmaceutical, concentrated animal feeding operations, like CAFOs. On our farm, the nutrient difference in folate -- just pick one nutrient -- between a USDA-blessed -- we call it the ""U.S. duh"" -- The USDA-blessed egg at 47 micrograms and a Polyface-pastured egg at 1,200 micrograms are incomparable. Chris and I categorically reject any and all CAFOs, chemical fertilization, aquifer irrigation, and genetic modification, as being necessary or meritorious in food production. Factory food has no merit in this debate, and none of the studies will hold water if they use factory food, and you'll find that they all do.Number two: Plants are sentient beings. They attack, communicate, respond, and build communities. Their language is chemical. Plants have faces, even though we might not recognize them. The affirmative promotes a segregated view toward life. Chris and I promote an integrated view. Number three: The motion before you does not allow for climate, cultural, economic, or hunger contingencies. An essential thing: the affirmative has not asked for any contingencies. If the affirmative wanted some contingencies, they should have worded the resolution or not agreed to their position. Chris and I will hold them to the motion's clarity. Number four: Domestic livestock are owned by 60 percent of the world's poor, primarily because they represent portable wealth to the unlanded poor and nutrition density protected from spoilage and vermin. The affirmative position is a direct attack on the world's poor. Number five: Not a single affirmative study assumes modern, pasture-based models, using high-tech electric fencing, portable shade cloth shelters, permaculture, hydration techniques, or cottage-based, localized processing infrastructure. This oversight dooms every affirmative conclusion to obsolescence. Number six: Life requires death. The fact that all of us can come to this luxurious room, comfortable and well-fed, and entertain ourselves by debating whether we should viscerally and actively participate in our role on an ecological continuum is bizarre. Native Americans ate 10 pounds of buffalo a day, when they could get it. And plenty of starving children in the world would be grateful for a morsel of anything, whether it wiggles or not. Number seven: Everything is eaten and being -- is eating and being eaten. If you don't believe that, go lie naked in your flowerbed for three days, and see what gets eaten. Number eight: Humans are the ultimate caretaker species, and the notion that my dog is my uncle is my cat is my child does not indicate an evolutionary newfound state of heightened spiritual cosmic awareness, but rather a profound devolution into ignorance and disconnection to our ecological umbilical. Number nine: Killing and eating are interchangeable. If it is wrong to eat, then it is wrong to kill. Killing without eating is an insult to life and resource. Number ten: Environmental integrity demands certain patterns whether we like them or not. Chris and I believe these patterns supersede Mickey Mouse, Bambi, and Templeton, the rat. When my parents purchased 550 acres in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley in 1961, it was a cheap and great. Gullies, many measuring maybe 12 feet deep, incised the fields -- deep scars, testifying to the death from grain production. Organic matter averaged one percent. Large areas that had lost three to five feet of top soil were barren rock. At the time, the farm would only support 20 cows. Now, a mere 52 years later, organic matter averages 8 percent, the gullies are healing, the barren rock faces are covered with a foot of new top soil, and the farm supports 150 cows. Out of ashes came a phoenix. How? By mimicking the foundational principle of ecological health. Animals (primarily herbivores), perennials, and predation. In case you missed this in biology class, here’s how it works: Sunlight converts to biomass through photosynthesis. The biomass grows slowly at first, then rapidly, then goes into senescence. The herbivore prunes the senescence biomass back to restart the rapid growth cycle. Predation -- both carnivorous and otherwise, like weather or fire -- creates movement patterns, even intensifying herbivores into mobs. All fertile soils have been built with perennials, herbivores, and predators, not tillage and annuals, like wheat and corn. By practicing this mob stocking herbivorous solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration fertilization, our farm is growing soil, growing organic matter, healing the water cycle, and pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Every single nook and cranny on the planet is full of animals. Why? Because they convert biomass into soil. From kitchen scraps fed to the homestead chickens to caribou converting lichens to manure, animals create ecological integrity. :umans can’t eat most biomass. The few types we can, like vegetables, require extremely fertile soil. Not one single organic vegetable or produce regimen exists that doesn’t rely on animal or fish manures for fertility. The principle of life requiring death or sacrifice is a most profound spiritual and ecological truth. How we treat the plant and animal in life impart sacredness to the sacrifice. The reason herbivores and seafood form the basis of all diets in antiquity is because these were the only nutrient-rich options that didn’t require tillage and storage. Until mechanization and cheap energy, tillage was extremely laborious. Another critical ecological function for animals was that they were the only way naturehad of moving around fertility. Gravity pulls biomass downhill. The only way to defy gravity and pull it back uphill is to either walk it up or fly it up. What makes it do that? Predation. The most efficacious way to remediate environmental degradation while producing the nutrition required by our human population is to embrace animal husbandry in a biomimicry paradigm: perennial, animal, predator. Alan Savory’s eloquent TED talk explains proper animal management is the best hope for stopping climate change and desertification. So vote for ecological integrity and nutritional superiority that we should eat both plants and animals. In case you forgot, it’s the negative position in this debate.",1.0

This is -- I mean, it's serious. Any of those are possibilities, and they're not mutually exclusive. What we do know is that there is a wealth of information about biochemistry and the effects of the specific nutrient deficiencies that can be most common in vegetarian diets that are all related to mental health.

But I would like to also make the point that Dr. Barnard cannot have his low-fat, low-glycemic, vegan, chocolate cake and eat it to, because the studies that Dr. Barnard cited at the beginning about the relationship between eating meat and cancer and coronary heart disease are also observational studies, and they also tell us absolutely nothing about cause-and-effect relationships.

One would be to try to control for all the differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians to better understand in those observational studies. The other point would be to go back to the evidence that I brought up in the beginning. And I'd like to start there just very briefly. Weston Price found, in numerous cases with good data from the same doctor reviewing --John Donvan: Who is -- he was the first research director for the American Dental Association and a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology. His approach was to try to look at populations that were actually free of disease. And so what he found was that in some cases -- his data on tooth decay were far better than his data on cancer. But he had some data on cancer, and there were cases of populations that did not have modernized diets but had meat in their diets that were free of cancer. What that means is that even the most vulnerable members of the population were protected. We don't know if they were protected by meat. But if you take a population of smokers, that's not what you find. There is no population of heavy smokers where all of them are free from cancers. So it’s a fundamentally different point. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. So -- Yeah. But the problem is that all of your meat studies are based on toxin-laden meat that's been raised in a factory-farming situation. If you take that out of it, the nutrition and the analysis is completely different. And not only that, but I'd like to ask a question -- you're talking about cooking, cooking, cooking, does that mean -- I'd like to get back to the topic actually -- that if we don't cook it and eat raw meat, then we're okay and it's okay to eat meat with a face if we don't cook it?",2.0

Colin Campbell, a biochemist at Cornell University. And what he found was that the more animal foods people ate, the more problems they had; the more plants foods people ate, the healthier they were. And these were animal foods that were not necessarily produced in factory farms, so just the animal foods were correlated with human health problems, including cancers. And so that was not factory-farmed meat. It was range-fed meat or grazing animals, and they were still problems.",2.0

If you go to the original data, there is no correlation between meat intake and cancer. If you read T.

And as time goes, we come to look at these things more critically and we start making decisions and choices that are, I think, more humane. And when it comes to animals, they have feelings like we do. They’re not that much different than we are, and there’s been attempts to rationalize and say, well, they are different. They don’t use tools, for example. Then Hane Goodallfound that animals were using tools, and we had to change our thinking and say, well, they don’t use language; but now we see that these other animals use language.

The world's strongest man is Patrik Baboumian, who recently lifted 1,210 pounds on an entirely plant-based diet. The world's greatest ultra long distance runner is Scott Jurek. He runs 100 miles, 125 miles, 150 miles at one stretch faster than any living human being on an entirely plant-based diet. This past Monday, the World Memory Championships were held in London. And contestants there can memorize a pack of cards in 30 seconds. And the winner was 25-year-old Jonas Von Essen, of Sweden, who -- -- was powered by an entirely plant-based diet. And, arguably the world's greatest brain, Albert Einstein wrote some words I want to share with you, ""In my view, that the -- “-- It's my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind."" And Einstein continued, ""So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish. And I'm feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore."" A generation ago we tackled tobacco, and while everybody is free to smoke we just know that we're not going to do it. And today the issue is food -- for yourself, but most importantly for that animal who is your child or your neighbor's child. This resolution makes the most health sense, “Don’t Eat Anything with a Face.”",3.0
against,"You know, it's fascinating how you can just kind of trade study for study for study. And that's I think what's happened tonight. The fact is that science is subjective based on the prejudice of the researchers. They set up the experiments this way. And so you got to look at who finances them, where the money goes, and decide what to do. That's how Monsanto got the, you know, GMOs through. They used geriatric rats. When the same experiments were repeated in Scotland with juvenile rats, all sorts of problems came up with GMOs. So I kind of, I kind of go philosophical on this, you know. We can trade dead bodies and thin people and heart attacks all night, alright? So, I find it fascinating that Gene says that Jesus and Muhammad could not show compassion. That's a powerful statement. Neither one of them was vegans. They both advocated eating meat. And if there certainly was an ethical dimension to this, one of those prophets should have said something about it, don't you think? The anatomy of a human is predacious. Our eyes are in the front of our heads. We have incisors. We're not built like prey. We are predators. And remember, there are no exceptions in this topic. So remember my initial point about the poor and why 60 percent of the world keeps livestock: because it’s portable wealth for the landed poor, and it’s real-time nutrition for those who can’t afford the high-fertility soil necessary to grow kale, and it’s not subject to vermin infestation like grain is, or like spoilage when you don’t have refrigeration. This motion, when you vote for the motion, is an unbelievable disrespect and dishonor of this world’s poor people who rely on real-time livestock for nutrition, and survival. So -- Yep. Leave and legacy -- -- and vote against the motion.",3.0
for,"Voting for this measure is voting for sustainability. It requires far fewer resourses to grow plant foods as opposed to animal foods. It is the way people with few resources have eaten for thousands and thousands of years. Our massive, animal-consuming lifestyle is fairly recent. We all agree that factory farming is bad, and we need to look at that because most of the animals who are killed and eaten today come from factory farms. If we think that that is unacceptable, we need to vote yes on the motion not to eat anything with a face. And going more philosophically, this is ultimately about our relationship with other animals. Historically, humans have eaten other animals, and as I mentioned, in tough times people have eaten other people. We’ve done a lot of very bad things, but when we have choices, when we have options, when we can live in a way that does not cause harm, why wouldn’t we? The word “humane” and “slaughter” don’t go very well together, and when you try to rationalize that these animals are there to be killed and eaten by us, many other bad things do happen. And I have been to a number of factory farms, I have been to a number of small farms, where animals are put in small areas, where they’re put in cages even, at these so-called “humane” farms. When the animals are seen as commodities, and as edibles, they are not treated with respect. That is bad for the animals, and = would also suggest it is bad for us. =’m not saying everybody who eats animals is a mean person. You know, we all grow, we all learn, we evolve, and when we learn, we can do better, and that’s what it’s ultimately about. =t’s about intent. And if you vote yes on this, that doesn’t mean you’ve got to be vegan tomorrow. This is a principle that we should not eat anything with a face. These are other animals. They have feelings just like our cats and dogs. They deserve to be treated with respect. Please vote yes on the motion.",3.0
