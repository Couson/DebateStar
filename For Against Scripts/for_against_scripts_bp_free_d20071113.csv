for,"  Feel like I did before my first love scene with Halle Berry, so, you can— imagine, if you have any imagination at all the butterflies, and actually the excitement. Uh, because I’m here in defense of what I think is one of the, uh, cornerstones of our republic, that of non-discrimination. And I think it was articulated in Brown vs. the Board of Education when, decided that discrimination in our public schools was unconstitutional, became part of our cultural lexicon a few years later when Presidents Kennedy and Johnson issued an executive order, that stately clearly and unambiguously, that, affirmative action should be taken to ensure that hiring, uh, decisions were made without regard to race. And then of course it was given teeth in the law, uh, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was very clear, that, uh, discrimination based on race was unlawful. And, uh, to quote, uh…an ‘80s sitcom, uh, it’s a different world from where ya come from. That was then, that was good old-fashioned non-discrimination, and it was good for America. Well times have changed, and what we’re talking about now, affirmative action is no longer about non-discrimination, it’s about racial preferences. And that is what we oppose—racial preferences. Now, that doesn’t mean that we believe that racism has suddenly disappeared. It hasn’t. We know that racism exists.  I’m 45 years old. I’ve been black in America for a long time. I have seen racism, I have been the victim of racism, I’m not about to stand up here and pretend, that it doesn’t exist. But the question before us is not, does racism exist, the question is, are racial preferences an effective means to combat racism. And the answer is simply no. There isn’t any evidence at all, that racial preferences actually benefits us in terms of our race relations, in fact, what evidence there is points to just the opposite. What we do know, is that racial preferences tend to, to en—enhance, and, and firm up negative stereotypes, particularly as it pertains to black intellectual capacity and academic capabilities. Um… You know…there was a saying that my mother had. And I hear it in my head right now. There is no monopoly on brain power. That’s what my mother said all the time, there is no monopoly on brain power, black people can compete, we can compete on the athletic field, we can compete in the symphony halls, and we can compete in the classrooms. And what’s more, my mother said, you can compete, and you will compete. But there are some folks who, sadly, are gonna tell my children something very different. And you don’t have to take my word for it, let’s just look at what they say. Richard Atkinson, former president of the University of California at Berkeley, standing before an audience similar to this, at University of San Diego, said that it was highly doubtful if not impossible that we would achieve diversity on our nation’s premiere campuses without the use of racial preferences. Now Atkinson was not standing before a curious world, telling everybody he’s just a big fat racist, and unless you rein me in I’m gonna start discriminating right and left!  What he was saying is that there is a monopoly on brain power, and that black students don’t have it in sufficient quantity to show up in significant numbers in our nation’s campuses. Now if you’re not sufficiently…offended, as you should be, let’s take something else that you often hear in discussions like this. Someone, maybe here or over here, is bound to stand up and say whoa! I benefited from affirmative action. You benefited from affirmative action, she benefited from affirmative action. And of course, they’re not saying, well, you benefited from non-discrimination. Well I did and that’s a good thing. What they’re saying is, I couldn’t qualify, you couldn’t qualify, she couldn’t qualify… Absurd.  I’ve met her for the first time, I’ve read what she’s written, I’ve heard her on the radio, this is a smart, dynamic woman. The idea, that but for racial preferences, Miss Crenshaw would be standing on the corner singing doo wop someplace is offensive to me, and it should be offensive to all in the sound of my voice. Now, you’re gonna hear a lotta statistics today, I’m not gonna talk to you about statistics. I’m gonna talk to you about people, because racial preferences impact and affect people. This past April, spring, my wife was at a birthday party with our, with our children. And…the mothers are sitting there talking, the fathers in there, you know, that, you tend to avoid these things like the plague so I wasn’t there. Uh…but the mothers are grouped and they’re talking about their children, where they go to school and it comes to light, that my oldest boy attends a magnet program, uh, for highly gifted students. Without missing a beat…one of the other mothers says, well, you know, now, with this Supreme Court decision they won’t be able to accept, uh, kids in these programs for diversity. Well, my wife was kinder than I would have been. After she picked her jaw up off the floor she explained to the woman, look. He’s not in this program because he checked some box. You can’t get in this program unless you score 99.9 percent on the test. Let me repeat that—99.9 percent on the test. And, he’s making straight A’s. In this program. And what is more ironic, is that the woman she was talking to, is a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. That…is the evil of racial preferences. That, is the real-life impact of racial preferences. Teachers, who lack faith in the academic abilities of their students, and children, who no matter how hard they work, no matter how…how broad their gifts… are stained with preference. With, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, benefi—fishi—fishishence. That’s Greek. And my child is not the only one, there are thousands, and thousands of students just like him, who cannot enter our nation’s college campuses boldly and confidently. They enter, again, dripping with the stigma of racial preferences. And I’m here to tell you tonight, that that is not good for America. "
against," You know, it always amazes me, to hear critics of affirmative action speak about this subject, as if racial preference were something that were invented in the ‘60s, to benefit people of color. Because in fact whether we wish to acknowledge it or not and of course we don’t, the entire history of this country is the history of affirmative action for white folks like myself. And unless we begin by discussing that affirmative action, and the impact that it has had we engage in a discussion that is both ethically and practically irresponsible. Contrary to what Joseph tells you this debate is about the extent to which racism still exists because it in— is indeed the existence of that racism which necessitated affirmative action in the beginning, and continues to necessitate it today. Whether we wish to acknowledge it or not, enslavement, Indian genocide, segregation, did not only oppress people of color, they elevated white folks, and provided us with opportunities that we did not in fact earn. The Homestead Act allowed whites to claim over 270 million acres of land for virtually nothing down, at a time when folks of color could not, today there are 40 million white folks descended directly from those, who received that land giveaway, millions of them, still living on the property, they owe their lives to affirmative action. Then there was the FHA home-loan program which for the first 30 years of its existence, operated in a whites-only fashion, lending over $120 billion worth of government-backed housing equity to whites, thereby creating the white middle class. And in large measure because of those preferences, the typical black college couple, college-degreed couple starts out with less than one-fifth the net worth of a typical young white couple because the latter of those, has likely received the benefits of their family’s prior head start while the former, are likely to have accumulated far less having had less chance to do so. So against that backdrop, ending affirmative action would only further cement the systemic advantages for whites that have been in place for hundreds of years, it would be tantamount to favoring those three laps ahead in a five-lap race even though those are ahead gained their head start as the result of an unfair process, but even worse, to end affirmative action would ignore the ongoing reality, not past, but ongoing reality, of white racial preference, and not only in education, but also in employment, and let me clarify, we were not told that our remarks tonight had to focus only on higher education. That resolution doesn’t mention higher education, I will not speak of it only with regard to schools. Because it is not only there that it matters. According to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, three out of four companies covered by affirmative action regulations violate them regularly, and not just that, but are also in violation of basic civil rights law. The problem is the OFCCP only has enough monitors to check up on the companies under their purview once every 46 years. So there’s no deterrent. But those who would end affirmative action never call for beefing up civil rights enforcement, indeed, though his teammates might not know it, Mr. Pell’s organization advocates abolishing anti-discrimination law altogether, as it regards the private sector, so, Joseph can sing the praises of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but the man sitting next to him, would get rid of it as it regards private organizations, so to endorse the resolution would only intensify the problem of discrimination, those who would end affirmative action ignore the study, recent study, which found that job applicants with white-sounding names have a 50 percent greater chance of getting a call-back for an interview than those with black-sounding names even when qualifications are indistinguishable. They ignore, not only that, but the research which has found that eight in 10 jobs are never advertised, instead they’re filled by networking, a process that mostly excludes people of color and women of all colors and elevates whites and men not because we are better for certain jobs but because we know the right people, and if affirmative action none of that would change for the better…if anything it would get worse, the same is true for schooling. Our opponents will rail against so-called preferences of students of color while they ignore the preferences built in for whites. So they condemn the University of Michigan for giving 20 points on a 150-point scale to students of color but they ignored the points that were in practice, essentially for whites only. Like the 16 points you got, if you were from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The snow is not the only thing white there. The 10 points, just because you went to a top high school which means your parents live in the right zip code. The eight points for taking advanced-placement classes, which are three times more available in schools serving white kids than kids that serve mostly students of color or the four points you got if Daddy went to Michigan. They rally behind Jennifer Gratz, as the supposed victim of reverse discrimination because the year she was rejected, there were about 85 students of color who got into the Michigan despite having lower scores and grades but they say nothing about the 1400—let me repeat— 1400 white students with lower grades and lower scores than Jenny Gratz, who got in. You see, less-qualified white people are no problem, but less-qualified people of color, my goodness, we can’t have that. They say nothing about the study from six weeks ago which found that for every one student of color, who receives any benefit from affirmative action in college there are at least two whites, for every one person of color two whites, who also didn’t meet the requirements but got in because Daddy wrote a check, or Mama made a phone call, or somebody pulled strings and got them in, but affirmative action for rich white people is never a problem for the folks like our opponents. While they insist affirmative action is racist because it holds people of color to lower standards the fact is, it is whites who have held to lower standards, it is whites and only whites I would suggest who can get C’s all the way through school, brag about their mediocrity publicly, mangle the English language, and go on to become Presidents of the United States. So, when they lament the supposed damage done to student of color by affirmative action because it supposedly forces them to question their abilities, ask yourself, why no concern for the mental health and self-image of white Americans, who have being preferred for 400 years, and if their argument is correct, must be the most self-hating people on the face of Planet Earth. And no, affirmative action doesn’t place people of color in positions for which they’re unqualified, indeed, once we control for economic status comparing only whites and folks of color from families with both the same income and wealth profile, there is no difference in college graduation rates, and only an insignificant difference in college grades. And black students at the most selective schools, actually do better in relation to their white counterparts than those in less-selective schools. Furthermore according to 200 different studies on the subject—not just one that I’m pulling out of my ass but 200 different studies—employees who have benefited from affirmative action perform equal to or better than their white male counterparts once given a chance to improve themselves, so in closing, unless our opponents can show you that they have some alternative mechanism for addressing that legacy of white racial preference— —and the ongoing advantages extended to whites in this country, unless they can demonstrate some alternative means, by which true equal opportunity to flourish to vote for them, and to vote for ending affirmative action is to engage in an act of irresponsible racial aggression. It is to ignore the wisdom of Dr. King who said quite clearly in 1963, quote, “Whenever this issue of compensatory or preferential treatment is raised, some of our friends recoil in horror. The Negro should be granted equality, they insist, but should ask for nothing more. While at first that seems unreasonable, in fact it is unrealistic, for it is obvious that if you take a man and put him at the starting line of a race, 300 years after another man, the first man would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up,” end of quote. And to end affirmative action even does violence to the logic displayed by Ronald Reagan, whose mention alongside the word logic, is rare, coming from me, but who said as governor of California, when signing into law that state’s affirmative action policy— didn’t get my one-minute warning, but if I could finish the quote from— If I could finish the quote from— That’s fine—"
for,"—clearly they belong at the table. I do wanna say one thing. The idea that all of these sorts of things that I’ve discussed, and the fact that there are other ways of addressing this problem, are there, and they’re worth talking about. The notion that anybody would say, that, a legacy student is something that black students should be proud to compare themselves to, or, that a legacy student is something that is okay, —and calling for diversity, thank you—"
against,"Well, one thing that John McWhorter’s right about is that we are gonna talk about diversity today and, it’s not bec— I’m not advocating it because I believe that every black person has the same experience, and ‘cause I believe that black people should have to carry the mantle of the black experience for our educational benefit, any more than I represent the same perspective as any other Asian person. I wanna tell you a little story about, um, my own experience, very recently I, I bought a house, um, in the Ditmas Park area of Brooklyn. And it’s been, um, heralded as the most diverse census track in the country. And so when I moved there, I found that, you know, the adults, they were, they were a little bit more hesitant to mix. Um, but the—but the young people at the, at the, at the pizza place, hung out, uh, with people of all different backgrounds, and little kids at the, at the, uh, playground were willing to play with each other, from all different backgrounds. And, this is something that I value. It’s to something that I think is easy, it’s not something that I think comes naturally. But it’s something that’ll only happen when people go to school together, when people are exposed to each other. And, preferably at an earlier age, and also in, in, in higher education. And you— so you should vote with us, if you agree with that statement, if you agree that a racially diverse environment is beneficial. If you believe that diversity enhances the educational experience, and that diversity is good for business and the economy. You should also vote with us, if you want a level playing field, not a false meritocracy, that is actually full of hidden benefits for the children of donors and legacies. Now, some of you may be wondering why I, a lawyer at the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, is here speaking out in support of affirmative action. Foes of affirmative action often like to say that Asians are the ones that are most harmed by affirmative action, that’s simply not true. First of all, many Asian groups, Southeast Asians in particular who face numerous educational disadvantages, need and benefit from affirmative action in all contexts and in particular, higher education. And all Asian-Americans need and benefit from affirmative action employment. So, I wanna echo what Tim Wise said is that we’re talking not just about diversity, about, uh, affirmative action in education, we’re talking about affirmative action in a variety of different contexts, including education, public contracting and so forth. And we’re also not just talking about a black and white paradigm, we’re talking about how affirmative action benefits other people of color, as well as women. So you should vote for us. If you value a diverse and inclusive society, and want a broad variety of experiences and viewpoints represented at our most prestigious, uh, educational institutions and workplaces. Business leaders have long realized the value of diversity. When the University of Michigan’s affirmative action programs were challenged before the United States Supreme Court, 65 leading American businesses, and their CEO’s filed a brief in support of affirmative action. These included American Express, Chevron and Microsoft, Boeing, Nike, and the list goes on. They realized that the leaders of tomorrow needed exposure to diverse people, ideas and perspectives. These companies found that individuals educated in a diverse setting were more likely to succeed and they had very concrete, concrete examples of, of these benefits. They believed that—they realized that people who were educated in a diverse setting were more likely to facilitate creative problem-solving approaches, they would—they can develop progra—uh, uh, products that appeal to a diverse customer base. They are better able to work with diverse business partners, clients and employees, and they’re more likely to contribute to a positive work environment. These companies need, and I quote, “the talent and creativity of a workplace that is”— or workforce rather—“that is as diverse as the world around them.” Minority professionals are also more likely to provide needed services to underserved communities. And this has been found in studies about minority doctors. Um, incidentally I—I think that this point was acknowledged by my colleague John McWhorter on the other side. In a study by the New—that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1996, it found that black and Latino communities were four times more likely to have a shortage of doctors, and, incidentally, black doctors tend to practice in communities with five times as many blacks as communities where other doctors practice. They also have more black patients, and more Medicaid patients. Latino doctors, similarly, tend to practice in communities with twice as many Latinos as communities where other doctors are, and they also have more Latino patients and more uninsured patients. You should also vote with us if you believe in leveling the playing field. Women and minorities still face obstacles gaining admissions to our most selective universities and workplaces. And the College Board’s own studies show that SAT’s are skewed in favor of whites and the wealthy. So, yeah, do I say the SAT’s meaningless, probably not. But, what is that meaning and who is it skewed in favor of, des—and despite these advantages that whites still have with standardized tests, there are still twice as many whites as minorities with below-average scores, in the top universities and this is because they’re legacies or the kids of donors. Legacies are three times more likely than general population to be admitted at Harvard and two and a half more times at Yale and over half of legacies are admitted at Dartmouth and Penn. Now turning to Asian-Americans, foes of affirmative action as I said love to use as a poster child for who would benefit if affirmative action ended and this is just not true. First of all, Asians have voted decisively in favor of affirmative action, in both California and Michigan when these policies were challenged. And, now, it’s true that some Asian-American students have done remarkably well in higher education, and these are disproportionately the children of highly-educated professionals, who immigrated here predominantly from, um, East Asia and South Asia starting with the change in immigration laws in the 1960s. But there are other Asian-American students that face considerable educational barriers. In particular Southeast Asians, who are the children of refugees who fled here after the Vietnam war, from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. I do a lot of my work in Lowell, Massachusetts, which is the second-largest Cambodian enclave in the country. A third of Lowell’s schoolchildren are Asian, predominantly Cambodian. But, 45 percent, a disproportionate number of Lowell’s school—of Lowell’s dropouts and students who are dismissed for sev—severe truancy are Asian-American. Almost one in two Hmong, and the Hmong are, um, an ethnic group that hails from Laos, and over one in four Cambodians in the United States have had no formal schooling whatsoever. In the affirmative action plans endorsed by the United States Supreme Court and the University of Michigan cases, you can consider a broad array of, of diversity factors, of which being—coming from a family of Southeast Asian refugees, can count. Proposition 209 ended affirmative action in California in 1996. Coincidentally this was the same year that I graduated from Boalt Hall School of Law, and as an aside, it was the diversity at Boalt, which was—Boalt was very diverse at the time—that in part inspired me to be a civil-rights lawyer. And after— —after affirmative action ended, diversity within the Asian-American population has suffered at—at most selective University of California schools. At Boalt Hall School of Law, there were more than four times as may Filipinos, and—with affirmative action than without, and overall the number of Asian-Americans has dropped by 1 percent at all UC law schools in the first three years without affirmative action. Whites on the other hand increased by 12 percent. At UC Berkeley undergrad, a study by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center found less than 50 total Cambodian , that’s far less than 1 percent, fif—less than 50 total Cambodian and Lao, at UC-Berkeley in 1993. And the case for affirmative action in employment is even clearer for Asian-Americans, there’s less than 1 percent of partners in major law firms are Asian-American and less than 1 percent of senior managers at Fortune 1000 and Fortune 500 firms. That’s very similar to the weights of representation for blacks and Latinos, but of white men are 97 percent of senior partners, of senior management, at Fortune 1000 and Fortune 100 firms, even though they’re only— —43 percent of the workplace— —of the workforce, thank you very much—"
for,"No, I would answer him, uh, with the words of Colin Powell. Who in talking about affirmative action, talked about color-blindness. Uh, and, and, um, I can’t remember the exact quote but what Colin Powell says, is that if you’re talking about, um…removing barriers, if you’re talking about non-discrimination…so that, uh, then, then he’s all for it, I’m all for it, everyone here is for it. If you’re talking about putting people, uh, in places of, of, uh…over, over the, uh…not the ruling of men, but, you know…office, officers over groups of men, who, uh, are not qualified, that is not what Colin Powell endorses and I’m positive, that that is not what, uh, Norman Schwarzkopf— No, of course not, I think that that, uh, that that clearly undermines the confidence that you need to have, uh, in a fighting unit."
against,"Right— Right.  No, I—I would—look, the example you give I wouldn’t endorse but I would endorse the government of the United States, and those corporations and their existing entities that stem from other entities in past generations— —that profited from and made possible the institutionalizing of white and white preference— would say—I wouldn’t do it in tax policy, I would, I believe, and we can come back and debate the issue of substantive repair and restoration and reparation some other time. We’re not here to debate it tonight, I would support the government doing that, I’m not saying, white folks should take our checkbook and have a line item for black people. You know, but, but I would suggest that the government, which made possible the institutionalization of this systemic inequality, has an obligation to rectify it by many means of which affirmative action is one. It’s not the only one, and it may very well not be the best one. But it’s one and it’s the one we’re here to discuss tonight— —and to get rid of it won’t bring us to any of the other, possibly better options that we could discuss at a—at a later time—"
for,"Uh, thank you. Uh, look, for the last 40 years America’s been engaged in a massive social experiment, to see whether the use of racial preferences could bring about the full integration of American soci—society. The question tonight is whether these preferential policies can deliver on that promise. And the question need not be abstract nor need it divide liberals and conservatives. That’s because in the last decade, a growing body of data has become available, that helps us get a handle on the trade-off between attending an elite institution, on the basis of different admissions standards, or attending a less prestigious institution. Let’s start with the effect of racial preferences, uh, in undergraduate colleges. I’m going to focus on one specific academic area, namely science. Not many minority students enter science, and many who do drop out along the way. Blacks receive about 5.3 percent of the bachelor’s degrees in science, despite making up about 9 percent of the college enrollment. Well research into these disparities by Dartmouth psychologist Rogers Elliot, provides a template of the kinds of questions we should be asking not just in the area of science, but in every area, where preferential policies are employed. Because it turns out that the preferences themselves, are part of the problem. The first thing that Elliot’s data does, is dispel the assumption that non-Asian minority students somehow aren’t interested in science. In fact, high-achieving black and Hispanic high school seniors, are more interested in majoring in science, than whites. The second thing the data tells us is that the really elite research universities, the schools that recruit the most promising students, black and white, use significant racial preferences to enroll the most gifted and talented black and—black and Hispanic undergraduates. Elliot’s nineteen ninety-sev—1997 study, fo—which focused on four Ivy League schools, found that the mean SAT math score for black students was 100 points below that of white students. That difference was about 1.6 times this—sorry, 1.6 standard deviations of the white scores. This means that the black mean was not only below the white mean, it was so far below the white mean that the majority of black students had scores in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution of scores of all students. Now right away this significant use of race preferences by the most elite schools is significant. The fact that the very top schools, that have their pick of the best students, are using preferences of this magnitude, suggests that the next tier of schools are likely using greater preferences, and in fact, second-tier schools do use greater preferences, about 15 percent larger than those used by the top schools. As a consequence, many black and Hispanic students up and down the line are attending schools where their credentials are significantly out of line with those of their, uh, classmates. Well one possible response at this point, and we may hear this later on tonight, is to say that the SAT math score doesn’t fairly measure black academic success. One could even deny that admitting black students with lower SAT math scores amounts to a preference. Well, we could debate this all night, but the research on this point is undisputed. If anything grades and SAT scores over-predict black performance. So admitting blacks and Hispanics with significantly lower test scores and grades make it all but certain that blacks and Hispanics as a group, will get lower grades as—in college, and that’s just what Elliot found. Blacks interested in science at these schools had grades almost a full GPA lower than whites. For many students, many minority students this made it difficult to continue in science, and Elliot found that only a third of the blacks who started in science, at elite schools, uh, completed a degree in science. The rest switched majors, or dropped out altogether. Uh, and this rate was twice the rate of white students at those schools. Second, uh, the lower grades of those who did finish disadvantaged them significantly both in going on to graduate school, and getting jobs. Well, if the story ended here you might think that test-score gaps make it highly unlikely that blacks will ever, or a significant number of blacks will ever succeed in science. Uh, this would be a very dreary conclusion if it were true but the fact is, it’s not true. This is where the data tells us something very interesting, it helps us get a handle on the real problem with preferential policies, because it turns out that the absolute value of a students math SAT score and high school grades, is less important, as the relative difference between one’s credentials, and those of his or her classmates. How do we know this. Well, it turns out that black students interested in science, who attend schools where their math SAT scores more closely match that of other students, persist in science at much higher rates, even though the average SAT scores at these schools is lower. So for example, Howard University, a historically black college, has average SAT math scores of about 450, well below the mean of the, at the, the, uh, SAT score, at the elite schools we’ve been discussing, yet Howard is the top producer of black undergraduate science and engineering degrees in the country. What’s more, a large percentage of undergraduate science majors at Howard and other historically black colleges, go on to get Ph.D.’s in science. Of the top 21 undergraduate producers of black Ph.D.’s in the country, 17 of them, 17 of the 21, are historically black colleges, and none are among the 30 or so most selective schools that routinely recruit the most talented black high school students. And so what we have is this perverse system. The institutions with the poorest track records for producing black Ph.D.’s in science, are getting the best minority students, and then, driving them out of science at twice the rate of white students. And the institutions with the best track record, are getting the middling students, and then, producing the overwhelming majority of black Ph.D.’s in science. Well what lessons can we draw from this. First, the existence of racial inequalities in society which nobody on this side of the table denies, is not a sufficient justification for preferential policies. It’s bad enough that African-Americans are so substantially underrepresented in science. It’s completely inexcusable that racial preferences end up frustrating and discouraging the gifted black high school seniors who say they want to study science. Second, it is misleading to evaluate racial preferences in the abstract, as if we’re talking about one— —or two institutions that use preferences in a handful of deserving cases. What we’re dealing with, the problem that we’ve got, is the systematic use of racial preferences by every single institution of higher education in the country. I’ve used my time to focus on one specific problem in some detail, but a growing body of research shows similar effects in many other areas. Surely all of us can agree, that schools should be required to publish graduation rates and grade distributions, and yes, persistence in majors, broken down according to the different preferences granted, and that means all of them, including racial preferences, alumni preferences and athletic preferences, the problem is the same in all cases. But more fundamentally, we need to ask ourselves why we tolerate the systematic use of race preferences. Every Supreme Court precedent in this area’s held that racial preferences are a last resort. Yet schools continue to treat preferences— —as a sacred cow— —they must defend to the death.  Uh—ooh. Uh, clearly, uh, institutions that operated in completely segregated systems had to do something more than, uh, remove the, uh, fact of segregation itself, they had to take affirmative steps to break down the barriers that they themselves had created. That was the original idea of affirmative action and it made sense then. But since then it’s grown into, uh, the systematic use of preferences all over the place and that’s just a completely— —different…use— No, I’m talking about particular institutions, for example— Yes— To remedy their own discrimination— That’s what I think, that’s right— Okay. Make the actor go first. Gonna be protesting outside of here. Um, I have two questions… I’m trying to choose— —which one, we’ll, I’ll ask this one. I’d like to know, uh, I, I listened to Tim’s speech, and, um…I, I, I… I thought, um…and wanted to know why is it that, uh, that blacks, or that you seem to think that blacks can only achieve, when the playing field is level."
against,"Well, I don’t say that black folks can only achieve when the playing field is level, I’m making a moral argument, that the playing field should be level because for it not to be, is an injustice, I’m talking about it from an ethical perspective. I happen to think people of—you know, Madame C.J. Walker was the first black millionaire, and she made it in 1911 when 67 black folks got lynched, but I don’t think we would say, well hey, if Madame C.J. could make it, you know, all y’all could’ve made it. Because she was selling beauty products to black women that white folks didn’t wanna make, good for her. But no one in their right mind would’ve said, see, everybody should go out there and work so I think folks can succeed, the question is what are our obligations as a society to create a level playing field, has nothing to do with what the outcome can or cannot be. It has to do with what is right and what is just and what is proper, and I would guess, just a guess, that when people have equal opportunity, they are indeed more likely to succeed. I’m pretty willing to stand on that this evening. Sure thing, um, John, you suggest that, people of color are potentially less qualified as evidenced by their college performance, maybe should go less selective schools as a result. So given that what would—what should we conclude, the people in the audience and, and those of us up here… from the data which suggests that men, on average, also receive far lower college grades than women, of all races and ethnicities. Does that mean that men are unqualified for the slots that they receive in colleges and law schools, and that maybe they should lower their sights to second- and third-tier schools and leave the best slots and opportunities for all the women. And if it doesn’t mean that, why doesn’t it mean that, given your argument about race. I’m sorry, could you clarify the question, there was a long— JOHN McWHORTER How do you— Okay, how would you respond to the point, that, if standards are lowered for a particular group over a long period of time, after a while that may be the best that that group ever does because they’ve never been asked to do better. Well first of all, standards are not lowered. Diversity is a—a genuine benefit, that occurs at an institution, both for the beneficiary and for other students at that institution. Secondly, beneficiaries of affirmative action are qualified. Students with very low test scores are never gonna get in, unless they happen to be legacies or children of donors. All beneficiaries of affirmative action have test scores, and, and, and other criteria where they are, are able to succeed and they do succeed. In the— this 1998 study by the two— —presidents of the university that, um, Kim Crenshaw mentioned, The, The, uh, Shape of the River, it found that, black students at the most prestigious institutions actually graduated at a higher rate than, than black students at less selective institutions. They had very similar career arcs once they graduated. They had the same rate of getting advanced degrees, and they were actually more likely than whites to get, um, uh, advanced degrees in law, medicine, and business, so I would say that, they are qualified and they are succeeding. All right, I too am trying to decide between two questions, so, the question I’m gonna ask, actually, it’s not, um, related to your part comments today. But, um, I understand that, um, the organization that you work for, the Center for Individual Rights, has a position that, um, civil rights laws should not apply to the private sector. And so, I’m wondering, is that—why—if you, if you’d like to explain that position, I mean, if— If we were back in the ‘60s where, when, uh, you know, we had, uh, black students trying to be served at lunch counters, um, in the South, would you, would you be standing behind the students or would you be standing behind the, um, the diners."
for,"Well— Yes, well, the simple answer is that’s not our position and it never has been our position, we routinely rely on these civil rights laws, like Section 1981, and Title 6 in our lawsuits. Those laws are primarily directed towards discrimination by private entities, uh, and private individuals, so, uh, our organization, uh, not only, uh, is not attacking those laws, we’re using those laws and we fully support the use of those laws and the various investigative agencies to go after, uh, identifiable acts of discrimination— —by individuals and private entities, so, the premise of your question, uh, is false."
against,"Well, I was just gonna say— My understanding is it was on your website in 2004."
for,"Uh, it’s—that’s false. Uh…Kimberlé, if it turned out, if the evidence developed and, uh, that, uh, race preferences or preferential policies, uh, turn out to pose barriers, uh, to minority success, similar to the barriers you identified in your talk, uh, would you reconsider your support for them. It’s my position, that, uh…affirmative action, in the form of racial non-discrimination, is a good thing, it’s good for America, that’s what Colin Powell says. Racial preferences, uh, are not a good thing, and I don’t believe that that’s what Colin Powell says— No, that’s—I said in my— You’re asking me to go back— And I think that I, I…uh, accurately reflected his sentiments— think I accurately— Now wait a minute— —I’ve heard you tell me that I was wrong, I didn’t hear the quote. did the read— Do you have the quote? Or are you just yelling out from the audience— In other words you don’t have the quote— —you’re just free to say I’m wrong— —without having— Booker T. Washington— …knew a very different world than ours, and I personally would not be in favor of his particular view that people really should just pick themselves up, and that’s all. Really, people do need help. He never knew the New Deal, he never knew the Great Society, he never knew Affirmative Action when it was first instituted, which I personally think was a very important thing given the situation in the country at the time. However, his basic insight that there does come a point when, in order to cope with an imperfect world, you have to do it yourself. There comes a point, is one that I think is valuable. One reads his writings now, and they're not nearly as reactionary and foreign as one would think. I think it’s an advance in our society that we do have a safety net, that we do have things to, for example, help the poor. For me, socio-economic preference makes perfect sense. The issue, simply, is that today there is not nearly as large an overlap between disadvantage and having black skin as there was in 1960 or even 1970— It’s time for a revision. It was about fifteen years ago—"
against,"don’t think it’s a question of whether we ought to expect people to do well on tests. I think we ought to. And I think we ought to make it possible for folks to do so no matter who’s taking it, whether they are taking it from some other country, whether they're taking it from down the block. I think the real question, however, is whether or not we ought to be looking at that test, no matter how it’s done on, by anyone, be they a foreigner, or be they someone who is a citizen of the United States, as to whether that should be the criteria for admission. Now, the research on this is very clear, that the highest correlation you ever will get on an SAT, a GRE, an MCAT, an LSAT, or any of these tests, with actual performance in the first year after the test is taken is point four. That’s fairly pathetic in statistical terms, because what it means is that, at most, sixteen percent of the difference between any two students can be explained or predicted by that score, meaning eighty-four percent has nothing to do with it. Why are we using merit criteria that don’t really measure merit, but do typically, not always, but over-represent those that have those resources, and those who are affluent. Not only, there are folks who don't have the resources who sometimes do well, but that’s the highest correlation. It seems to me that we ought to be looking at alternative criteria, including things like testing, but not overemphasizing those, because we know that in fact when those students who scored lower, who maybe didn't score as well as those at the very pinnacle get in at places like the University of California, that only about five percent of their grade differences can be predicted by the test scores. So, they're not being mismatched, they're not unqualified, there are other things that recommend them for the spot. So, we ought to expect and try to make sure everyone does well. We also ought to have a criteria that is both more fair and representative, but also more accurate. It doesn’t serve anyone’s interests to use a criteria that does not, in fact, predict success, and those tests simply do not. In fact, one study of law schools, talking about law schools, University of Michigan study found that there was an inverse relationship between LSAT score and future professional success. Meaning that those who did better actually did worse and weren't as happy in their jobs when they got out of law school and started practicing. So by that criteria, we ought o let all the folks in who bombed the LSAT, because they're going to make the best lawyers. Can I just add something to that as well? I mean, part of it is also you said that these foreigners were able to prep, which I would imagine means that they speak English and perhaps are from a professional background, that they, they knew about these tests. And I think that that is, that is a big issue, that, that the access to the materials and access to information about the tests also isn't equally available."
for,"Disadvantage— Range of disadvantage, disadvantages, uh, do not come with a black face. Uh, and this is why earlier I said, we need to talk about people, because when we start talking in these broad terms, we’re talking about the black middle class, I happen to live in Los Angeles, down the street from Calabasas , California, which is one of the wealthiest communities in America. I coach football, and I have black kids on my team with parents who make more money than most, half of everybody in here added up together. THE idea that, that these children are in need of preferences because they don’t have access, uh ,to, to the same, uh, benefits that their white counterparts, is just ridiculous. Because we’re not talking about individuals suddenly, we’re talking about people, um, generally, in term of their race. I also want to go back to, to address something else that was said, this idea of, of this testing. Look, right now, these are the tests that we’re using, and I want you to listen very closely, what we’re talking about, oh, the tests, uh, not the preparation, and on and on and this… The underlying message is that our kids can't compete, that my three sons cannot compete. And I don’t buy it. Well, that’s— If we want to get rid of these tests, then let’s get rid of them. Whatever standard we use, the standard should be applied equally to all kids— Robert? That's what we’re saying here. "
against," just, responding to the last thing John said, I think it’s interesting that he’s upset about, supposedly, ostensibly, middle class black kids saying that it’s white to be smart, and somehow that’s their pathology, and that’s the problem we should address. It’s an issue, we could discuss it at a different time. What I find interesting about it is that you, John, are affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, which has received money from the Bradley Foundation, hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is a foundation that paid Charles Murray to write The Bell Curve, which is a book that doesn’t imply that black people are inferior, it screams it from forty percent of its pages. So, when you say that black folks say being smart or doing well in school is acting white, the book, The Bell Curve, funded by the same people that fund the organization you work for, basically says the same thing, it says high IQ is white, or perhaps Asian, and black folks are genetically defective. I find it disingenuous for you to put the burden of that on black children, and not the very wealthy, well-heeled, well-funded white folks who actually print material that says black people are defective. And not one prominent conservative in this country, including the three of you, said anything public when The Bell Curve came out, not one word, not one prominent conservative. Let’s place our attention on those who actually say that white people are smarter, and black people are inferior, and you won't hear that from any of this."
for,"Sir, when The Bell Curve came out, I was very young, I had no public presence, I was studying linguistics, and so I don’t know what I would have said. To the extent that Bradley funded that book, which I frankly did not know, and that they fund some work that the Manhattan Institute does, that’s certainly true. Charles Murray has nothing to do with the Manhattan Institute, and stopped, as a matter of fact, while he was writing that book. And what I'm funded for doing at the Manhattan Institute is things like working on prisoner re-entry programs, et cetera. But what’s important is that when I talk about the “acting white” phenomenon, I'm not saying that it’s a pathology, I'm not blaming the black kids for this, this is something that happened as the result of a sequence of socio-historical things that ultimately have their root in racism. Nevertheless, it is there today, and I don’t think that it can be denied. And the issue is to treat it, and to show black kids that there are different ways to think along those lines. ROBERT SIEGEL OK, well enough about those other institutions, and uh…"
against," City College used to have open admissions, because it recognized that its purpose was to serve all the citizens of the city of New York, and it did that for a while. A lot of white folks who wouldn't have passed any test actually went to City College under the era of open admissions. And yet, when all the sudden people of color began to, quote, unquote, flood, being the metaphor we often use, uh, that hallowed institution of higher learning, then all the sudden we started talking about standards, and criteria, and remediation, and these people aren't really qualified. I think what taxpayers ought to expect is open access and ability to get into institutions they pay for. Because to get rid of Affirmative Action at City College or any public institution is to say that people of color who pay taxes should not expect representation for the taxes that they pay. And the same is true in contracting, and the same is true in public employment. I think City College ought to have open admissions, it worked really well for a lot of white folks for decades, and I think it’s a really good idea for students of color as well."
for,"was going to say, I'm glad you put that up, because I'm not convinced that diversity is all that important, uh, diversity in terms of skin color. I think that when we go to school, the people that we befriend, the people in our neighborhoods that, uh, that we hang out with, are people that we share values with. When you talk to college students, and people have been to college, and what was most important about their college experience, it had to do not with the color of the person sitting next to them, but the values of, of the teachers, and those kinds of things. Um, of course, I, you know, integration is a great thing. Uh, I'm for that. I'm for it when people want to do it. Um, am I, am I for people manipulating and forcing people? I don’t think that that’s a good thing, I don’t think that that’s, uh, I don’t think that that’s good for America at all. And I also want to make this point: uh, we talk about how great diversity is, and yet, the schools, who great diversity is for the educational benefits for our students, and yet the schools that are routinely churning out the greatest number of black doctors, the greatest number of black lawyers, are HBCU’s, which are not racially integrated at all: Morehouse, Spellman, Howard, et cetera. Ninety-eight, ninety-nine percent black. That is not, in my opinion, a bad thing. And if it is, then Tim, maybe we should make sure that we get a critical mass of white girls down at Spellman, and uh, be, be on our way— Robert, can I interject something quickly— Just real quick. That, thank you, that was it, that was it. That’s a distortion— That’s a distortion—"
against," Um, couple things. First of all, just to address something I think that was frankly disingenuous that was said by Terence Pell earlier, he said that his organization does not advocate no, uh, discrimination laws applying to the private sector. In May of 2004 I got on their web site, I was writing my book on Affirmative Action, it’s footnoted in my book, their statement of principles included the following: the Center for Individual Rights believes in the limited application of civil rights law and the right of private individuals to deal with others as they see fit. I'm not sure what that’s supposed to mean other than Woolworth’s gets to say, black folks don’t sit here, and cab companies don’t have to give rides. That’s what it suggests, that’s what it suggests. And you don’t have to like that that’s what it suggests, but that was what it said. Secondly, everyone up here on that side has said that Affirmative Action was legitimate in the old days, because of the existence of persistent racial discrimination. They’ve all acknowledged it. Which means we’re not debating a principle here tonight of color blindness in all cases, what we’re debating is the issue of facts on the ground. If the facts on the ground say that discrimination is still a significant problem, then by definition, by their own admission, the debate is over, and you have to vote for us. That’s not a debate trick, that's basically what they're saying. The only side that has presented any information at all tonight, let alone analysis, as to the existence of ongoing discrimination, is this side of the aisle, which means all of the things I said at the outset, about employment, about contracting, about education, an ongoing white racial preference has been utterly dismissed. If that still exists, their own standard of evaluation says that they lose and that we win. So just make sure you remember that when you punch those little buttons. The bottom line, and I'm going to quote, since I didn't get to ready my Reagan quote, I'm going to do this. I promise, if you cut me off, it’s, it’s it, it’s the quote. Ronald Reagan, when he was Governor of California, 1974, last thing he did as he left office was sign into law the Affirmative Action programs, and here’s what he said. He said, time and experience have shown that laws of anti-discrimination are not enough, justice demands that each and every citizen consciously adopt a commitment— …to Affirmative action— …so as to make equal opportunity a reality. Reagan was right, and they're wrong. "
for,"If white folks are so racist, if they come out of the womb hating black folks, why on earth would we trust them to run Affirmative Action programs designed to bolster the education of black students? That's what I heard him say. So what kind of society do we want? I have a little more faith in the American people than I think some folks on the other side do, because I think that the American people, they’ve spoken loudly in California, they’ve spoken loudly in Michigan and Washington, they will speak loudly in Arizona, and Colorado, and other states in the upcoming election, that they are in favor of integrated societies. The American people are in favor of equal opportunity. What they want is fairness. I think it’s quite a compliment that more and more people are saying, listen, they're, they're taking the words of my mother, and they're saying, listen, there is no monopoly on brain power. Black folks can compete, we want to give them the opportunity, and I think it’s about time."
against,"So, in talking about diversity and the benefits of diversity, now let, the other side makes it seem like we’re saying, well, you know, we want racially diverse classes because if you're black you come, you have a certain perspective and you're, you're expected to carry the mantle of that experience, same if you're Asian or, or white, or so forth… That, that’s not what we’re saying. There has been mountains of evidence about the benefits of a diverse educational environment, and a diverse workplace that was produced. In the University of Michigan cases it was produced before the court, and I'm sure that, uh, Mr. Pell’s organization fought that with the best arguments that they had, and the Supreme Court voted in favor of diversity. Also, with regard to the process that, um, educational institutions use to accept students, it’s a very, it’s a very flexible, individualized process that, that the type of admissions plan that was endorsed by the Supreme Court in the University of Michigan case is individualized, there are no quotas, it’s not mechanical. Because Mr. Pell’s organization actually won the case at the undergrad institution which, which found that the undergrad, um, policy at the time was too mechanical, so it’s a very individualized consideration. And, you know, the, the last thing I want to leave you with is, it’s what we call “The Causation Fallacy.” Even if, even without Affirmative Action, whites’ chances of admission only gets in, at our most prestigious, it only rises at our most prestigious institutions by one to three percent, according to that Bowen and Bok study, the one by the, um, the University Presidents. It only rose by one point five percent for the average white student. That’s because there’s a whole lot more white students than minority students that are applying. So, even without Affirmative Action it’s not going to increase a lot of people, it’s not going to increase any, any visual applicant’s chances of getting in by a whole lot. So, this whole, um, you know, thing about how every white student hat has been, um, admitted, or even every Asian student who, you know, sometimes believes that that’s the case, thinks that I would have gotten in if it wasn’t about Affirmative Action. That’s simply not true."
for,"Well, tonight all of us are gathered here to defend the principle of equality, and I think we do that with a sense that equality is under siege as never before, and that’s because real equality is never achieved, it’s always coming into existence. As our opponents say, there’s a lot of work to be done, and that’s true. But today, the challenge to equality doesn’t come from the political extremes, it comes from really the political middle. Moderates have tried to eliminate differences in achievement among black and white eighteen year olds by essentially engineering an admissions system that makes them go away, and with characteristic efficiency those preferences have been extended to every institution after, uh, undergraduate college, including professional schools and public and private employment. Though they aren't intended to do so, these policies perpetuate racial differences, and they corrode social bonds. They make it difficult for minority high school students to attend schools where their credentials would make them academically competitive. And that’s the point about the, uh, historically black colleges. It’s not that blacks ought to go to the HBCU’s, it’s that the white schools, the elite schools ought to learn from the way the HBCU’s run their admissions programs, they admit on the basis of merit, and it makes a big difference. The most troubling aspect about tonight’s debate has been the reaction of our opponents to efforts to disclose the problems and end these policies. Our opponents essentially demand that we continue to wink at real differences in qualification, and demand also that we remain discreetly silent about the predictable consequences of this winking. It’s time to put an end to race preferences, it may have been a good idea at one point, but it no longer serves a useful purpose. There are too many other important issues that we need to be talking about if we’re going to achieve real equality in our lifetime."
