for,"New light, John, I can . After many, many rounds, more than I can remember, of difficult contentious negotiations, I can share with you the insigh t that people that haven’t slept for five or six days at a stretch get very irritable -- -- of all nationalities. John Donvan:Have you slept before coming here tonight? Just before coming here. Hopefully I ’m not irritable . Yeah, my partner is one of America’s finest and most experienced diplomats, Ambassador Tom Pickering. Short answer is, o ne more than Track I. The long answer: it ’s non -officials engaged in diplomacy to see if they can find a way to crack the nut. John Donvan:From the inside , we ’ll be hearing some of that . Ladies and gentlemen, let ’s welcome please Tom Pickering -- -- and the side arguing for the motion, and that motion is, “ Obama’s Iran Deal is Good For America. ” And we have two debaters arguing against it . Please, let ’s welcome Mike Doran. Mike, welcome back your second time debating with us . You are a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, a former senior director in the National Security Council, also an insider in this process . You helped devise and coordinate a lot of U.S. strategies on Middle East issues, including efforts to contain Iran . You recently Tweeted this, “ In --” 1 44 characters -- “ In Obama -land, the kiss of the nuclear deal will turn the Iranian frog into a beautiful prince, ” but don ’t you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince?",nan
against,"They ’re kissing a lot of frogs . It’s true.  I ’m against that, yes. That is true . That is true . We keep sending them ideas, and the White House keeps saying, you know, “ Iran sanctions are just so yesterday. ",nan
for,"All right . Thanks very much, everybody . Thanks for coming . I’m really pleased to be here and honored to be joined on my side of the debate by Tom Pickering . Also glad to be up here with Mark and Mike . They play an important role . We disagree on this subject, but they play an important role in what is a really important debate . Let me get straight to the po int. Tom and I are going to argue that the Iran deal of President Obama is good for America for three basic reasons . One, it ’s important for the United States to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Two, this deal effectively does that, and it does it while avoiding a costly and unpredictable conflict . And three, the alternatives to this deal -- the alternatives to this deal are far worse . And I ’m going to ask you to pay particular attention to this third point, because I suspect our opponents in this debate will spend a considerable amount of time telling you why this agreement is imperfect and why it should also have X, Y, and Z . What I don’t think you ’ll hear them do is present a credible and realistic alternative to it . And I r emind you as we start, that the proposition on the table is not, “ Is this a perfectdeal that you would write alone if you didn’ t have to negotiate it with somebody else?” but “Is it good for America? ” And I think if that’s the question, it clearly is . In fact, I don ’t even think it’s much of a close call. The first point , I’ll be very brief on . The United States has an interest in stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon because an Iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten the regi on and some of our close allies, including Israel. It could be a precedent and a stimulant for other countries in the region to develop nuclear weapons . And it would be harder to deter and contain it in terms of its foreign policy in the region. I just want that to be clear. I don ’t think our opponents disagree with that, so I would just want to stipulate it upfront. That doesn’t require a debate . It is important for the United States . What we disagree on is whether this deal effectively does that. And Tom and I will assert that it does, and let me tell you why and why it’s good for America. The framework agreement that the Obama Administration negotiated cuts of all of the possible paths for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Now, in this brief opening sta tement, this is not the place for a very detailed analysis of every provision in the agreement . I suspect most of you have already read it and are familiar with it . What I would do is underscore some of what this agreement does . And I would ask you to think about it in these terms: Imagine the world before us with the agreement, if we get it finalized and we implement it, and imagine the world without the agreement . Think about those two alternatives -- alternative worlds for the future and ask yourself which one you want to live in, which one is good for America. I said the deal cuts off all of the possible paths to an Iranian nuclear weapon. There are three basic paths: Enriching uranium to be able to use it for a bomb, usi ng plutonium to create a nuclear weapon, or a covert path . And this agreement stops all of those tracks . On enrichment, what does the agreement do ? With the agreement, Iran would have to take its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, which is aroun d 10,000 kilograms or 12 tons, enough for several nuclear weapons today, a s we discussed this, and get rid of 98 percent of it, keep only 300 kilograms . Without it, they could have whatever stockpile they like . With this agreement, they w ould have to get rid of two -thirds of their installed centrifuges . Today they have 20,000 installed centrifuges . With this agreement, it would have to go down to 6,000, of which only 5,000 could be operating for 10 years . And they would all have to be theoldest technology, the least efficient. Without it, they can operate whatever centrifuges they like . With the agreement, they would have to stop all of their enrichment at an underground facility called Fordo w and they could only keep nonoperating ce ntrifuges there . Without the agreement, they can use Fordo w for whatever they like . With the agreement, Iran couldn ’t use its more advanced centrifuges to do enrichment for 10 years and would have long -term limits on research and development . Without the ag reement, they can do whatever R& D they want and develop more advanced centrifuges very quickly . With this agreement, Iran could not enrich uranium to 20 percent, the level, if you recall, when the Israeli prime minister was here in New Yor k a couple of years ago, he identified as the most concerning thing . So if you enrich uranium to 20 percent, it ’s a short step away from 90 percent and the ability to use it for a bomb . The interim agreement that we negotiated got rid of that 20 percent stockpile, this agreement requires Iran to not enrich at all to 20 percent, clos es off all the potential paths to highly enriched uranium for a bomb. It also closes off the plutonium path. With the agreement, Iran has to get rid of its current heavy water reactor at a place called Arak and replace it with one that would not produce any weapons -grade plutonium at all. And it couldn’ t do any reprocessing. It has to ship the core out and can ’t use this site . Without the agreement, they can fini sh production of that heavy water reactor and start producing weapons -grade plutonium . Finally, and maybe most importantly, this blocks the covert path . With this agreement in place, Iran would be bound to accept unprecedented intrusive inspections , forever, with a mechanism for resolving disputes . We would have access to their entire fuel cycle from the mines and mills of uranium to production sites for centrifuges all the way to the enrichment sites themselves where there would be cameras and inspectors on a regular basis . That ’s what we have if we get this agreement, if we conclude this agreement . Without this agreemen t, we don’t have any of that, a nd we have no idea what Iran is up to . The bottom line of all that, when you put it all t ogether, is Iran’s breakout timeline, the amount of time it would take them to get enough material for a bomb, goes from around two months, what it is today, to over a year, which our military specialists are confident give us enough time to react if they seek to violate it . I could go on, but you get the bottom line point. When you compare these two worlds that we could live in with the agreement or without the agreement, clearly, this agreement is good for the United States . Indeed, I think it ’s not even a close call. When Tom takes the floor -- I ’ve made the positive case for this agreement . When Tom takes the floor, he ’ll be able to talk about some of the reasons why not only is this a goodagreement, but all of the potential alternative s to it are much, much worse . ",nan
against," Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you. It ’s fantastic to be here. There’s nothing more wonderful than Central Park in the springtime except the IQ2 debate. Now, as you know, we ’re going to argue -- M ark and I are going to argue against . We think this is a very bad deal . Let me just get right to the point. To me, this is like -- say you ’re a legitimate businessman, and a Mafioso comes and you ’re in a little bit of -- you ’re in a little bit of trouble financially, and he offers you a loan, and you take it, and you tell you rself that this is a temporary thing and that as the Mafioso becomes your partner, over time, he ’s going to moderate, he ’s going to understand what it’s like to get honest profits, and he ’s going to change, and he ’s going to start abiding by the law . This agreement would be fantastic if we were making this agreement with Denmark, but we ’re not . We’re making it with Iran . We know Iran well. We’ve known them for 35 years . We know what they ’re like. The Iran that we have today is the Iran that we had 10 years ago . It’s the Iran that we had 20 years ago . It’s the Iran that we had 35 years ago . And that’s -- that is actually the single most important question that I want to put to you tonight is, why do we think that this regime is going to abide by this agreement ? That ’s the -- that is the single most important -- the single most important question, and the administration never, ever -- never ever talks about it .Now, there are two stories out there that are being told. One is the story that the Obama administration is telling, and the other story is the one that our allies in the Middle East are telling . The story the Obama administration is telling us goes something like this: Back in -- back in April of 2013, there was an election i n Iran which brought to power this guy Rouhani, who is a reformer. And Rouhani wanted to change relations with the West. He wanted to change all of this enmity and conflict between Iran and the West. And so he started this negotiation with the Americans , and he made some very important concessions to the Americans, concessions that they had never made, along the lines of the ones that Phil was talking about, basically the essence was a willingness to constrain their nuclear -- their nuclear program. 1 And that then has led to this process that we have here before us today . That’s not the stor y that our allies are telling . They ’re saying that this process is not the result of a strategic change in Iran . It’s the result of a strateg ic change in Washington. The United States -- the United States started this process with major concessions . It ripped up six Security Council resolutions that called for zero reprocessing and zero enrichment . It gave Iran, in the first step, as part of the interim agreement, it gave it the right to enrich, and it said also that the restrictions on its program would be temporary, right ? So the negotiation after that -- after the initial interim agreement and the negotiations were over how long wo uld that period of temporary restriction be ? And under what -- how big would the restrictions on the -- on the program be ? And what would Iran get in return ? Now, just for signing up to the interim agreement, we started paying Iran $700 million a month . We ’re paying them to negotiate with us . We ’re going to -- when they sign the deal, we ’re going to give them $50 billion right up front and shortly thereafter and additional $ 70 to $90 billion. Now, when you ask John Kerry, what ’s the evidence that there ’s been a strategic change on the part of the Iranian regime ? He says, “ Well, look, they signed the interim agreement, and they have negotiate d for over a year now with us, and they have abided by the terms of the interim agreement duri ng this period of negotiation. ” We paid them to do that . We paid them to do that, and we have dangled out a big prize at the end of this signing bonus and the relief from -- and the relief from all sanctions . So, of course, they’re going to be -- they’re going to play nice at the negotiating table . What other evidence do we have other than the fact that they have allowed us to pay them to negotiate with us, that they have made a strategic shift? No evidence whatsoever . They still are the -- they still spout the same anti -Semitic rhetoric, they stillcall for the destruction of Israel, they still destabilize their neighbors . They still have four Americans who are hostage there . They have a Marine, they have a cleric, they have a newspaper reporter, and they have a former FBI agent . They didn’t even have the -- they didn ’t have -- they didn’t even have the grace and the good manners to release the hostages during this -- during this negotiation. Now, Mark and I are going to divide our duties here . Mark is going to explain to you why all of those characteristics of the deal that Phil went through are basically a fiction, why it ’s a fantasy to think that any of this -- that the Iranians will abide by any of these -- by any of these terms that Phil mentioned . I am just going to make a couple of statements about the broader problem of the deal in the region. Mark ’s going to talk about the nuclear breakout. I’m going to talk about the regional breakout . We are turning -- with this deal, we are turning Iran into the regional hegemon in the Middle East, all right ? We have turned a blind eye to the expansion of Iranian power in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen, and elsewhere across the region . And when we hand them $50 billion a few mon ths from now, if, in fact, we do, we’re going to see an expansion of those -- an expansion of those activities . That ’s one problem . Another problem is we have set off with this deal a regional nuclear arms race . The Saudis have said openly, explicitly, that they are going to match the Iranians capability for capability . They ’re not going to wait for this deal to end before they start developing their own capability, and they have made that explicit . There’s no way to deny, absolutely no way to deny, th at there is not a regional nuclear arms race underway right now . The other thing is this deal does not make the United States any safer . One of the things that has been left off the table, not part of the negotiations, is the illegal ballisti c missiles program of the Iranians . So before long we ’re going to have an Iran -- a nuclear Iran with a ballistic missile capability capable of hitting the United States . A good deal, a good deal -- and this is what we need to define -- a good deal is one that stops Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, A ; B, makes our allies in the region feel safer and stabilizes the region; and, three, makes the United States safer . This deal does not meet that basic criteria. ",1.0
for,"Thank you, John, and thank you for your warm welcome . It’s a pleasure to be h ere with Phil and also with Mike and Mark . I have much I think to say tonight in a very short period of time, and I will do what I can to compress it . Not too long ago when he was still alive, Daniel Patrick Moynihan said famously that, “You ’re each enti tled to your own opinion but not your own set of facts. ” Tonight from Mr. Doran we’ve heard an extremely interesting, unusual, and strange set of facts . So let me just cover a few of those that I think will be helpful to your understanding of the arrangements that we have to deal with. First and foremost is the notion in his part that somehow $50 billion will pass on the moment of signature . The truth is, of course, that until Iran complies with four major requirements of the deal -- tha t they put their centrifuges aside ; that they change their stockpile from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms ; that they, in fact, dismantle the central piece of the reactor that can make plutonium ; and that they agree on that the past efforts that the y made in a nuclear direction , in a nuclear weapons direction , are fully explained to and satisfactorily explained to the Int ernational Atomic Energy Agency -- they get nothing out of this deal . N o sanctions relief until those particular steps take place, no money passes hands to Iran.Secondly, the notion that Iran is somehow going to enjoy, when it does get this money, the opportunity to play havoc in the Middle East is both strange and unusual . Certainly we watch carefully what Iran does . And none of us have undertaken the notion that the Iranians are angels, that the whole agreement is indeed put together with very strong inspection mechanisms well beyond what you have ever seen before in any country around the world in order to prevent the kind of cheating or indeed the kind of misuse of the agreement for narrow political advantage . Were the Iranians, in fact, going to misuse this money, the y would have far done it well before an y receipts from sanctions relief, their priorities for the things that they ’re doing in the region are high enough, I think, for them to continue to do that. It is important, too, to remember this is a nuclear agreement, not a ballistic missile agreement . Both sides have agreed on the importance of the nuclear agreement as a matter of priority . Obviously, a missile -- ballistic missile without a nuclear warhead is not the kind of threat that has been portrayed to you here . And there are plenty of opportunities in the next set of agreements, if this one is successfully concluded, to move on to that particular effort . Now, let me turn, if I can, to the key questions, a nd they’re important to all of us here . You ’ve already understood that both sides share a deep sense of the necessity to stop any Iranian nuclear weapon . That ’s stipulated and agree d. It ’s important, however, to understand that the second question -- is this a good deal for America -- is one that we would certainly answer in the positive for a whole set of reasons that Phil set out for you. And the third question is, what are the alternatives to this deal ? Well, the alternatives, quite starkly and quite frankly, are two : n o deal at all, or an attempt to use sanctions to see if, in fact, we can achieve a better deal . You heard from Mr. Doran that he would like to have zero enrichment. I would like to have zero enrichment, too . I’d like to be a billionaire . I ’d like to believe in the Tooth Fairy . But for 14 years, previous administrations attempted to negotiate for zero enrichment, and got nowhere . And the value of zero enrichment, in my view, is not significant compared to the value of the arrangement that we now have on the table, with all of its inspectionmechanisms, and with al l of its limitations on Iran, and that ’s extremely important to keep in mind . In addition to that, what would happen if we walked away from an agreement? How and in what way would that affect the situation? It would affect it very badly . We would have turned down what our allies joined us in negotiating . The notion that we could achieve effective additional sanctions without friends, allies, and indeed, without the participation of the world community, is well beyond reality . It’s not there and it’s not . The third question is, what would happen in the event we had no agreement . Iran, of course, could move freely to a nuclear weapon . They wou ld have two to three months to breakout time . They would, if they -- they ’re so inclined, use that opportunity, as we have a 10 -year agreement with a 15 -year limitation on the production of more than 300 kilograms of low -enriched uranium to hold them in place, and I think that’s important. Finally, I think it ’s significant that you understand that the alternatives to an agreement may well involve the necessity to use force under conditions where we would be highly isolated, having turned down the kind of agreement we participated centrally in negotiating -- a good agreement . If we were to use force, it would mean, I think, from the best judgment that I can get of military officials, a three to five-year cessation in the Iranian agreement before they could move back to where they are now. And a situation under which we would have to bomb pretty continuously to keep the Iranians under that kind of stricture and under that kind of pressure . To me, there is no alternative . This agreement is a good one . I hope that you will consider that carefully . And when the time comes to push your little button, push the button in the right order for the right set of arrangements that President Obama has put before you. ",1.0
against,"The agreement doesn ’t have binding restrictions . This is the -- the reason that we have gotten any compliance out of the Iranians th us far is because we ’re paying them to do it. The -- you know, Tom mentioned that the agreement is going to require the Iranians to come clean on all of their past program, which is an incredibly important aspect of the monitoring mechanism. Unless you understand what the program was, you can ’t monit or it. The fact of the matter is the Iranians have stiffed the IAEA for a decade about this . We have not stood firm on it. We have not forced them to come clean on their past program. And the agreement that we got from them about that is that, yes, the y will address that question in the future . I’m willing to bet anything -- I’m going to make a prediction right here, Phil. And my prediction is that if this deal is signed, we ’re going to give them sanctions relief before they ever come clean on their p ast program, because they have never ever come clean and they ’re not going to let us into military sites.",2.0
for,"Look, let me offer you the facts, not your imagination, not your predictions -- Michael Doran : Have t hey ever come clean to the But that’s a step . But we will not --Michael Doran : You just said that. -- conclude the release of sanctions until they have come clean with the IAEA . That’s an indisputable negotiating objective of the United States . That ’s what we have said we will agree to, nothing less . And so that’s -- you ’re sitting here making up fairy stories about what it is that’s going to be agreed or not agreed . Nobody that I know o f, when the framework came out on April 2nd, who knows anything about this agreement was not surprised by the degree to which Iran had come in our directions, including, I have to tell you, a number of very senior Iranians . The notion that somehow we have been snookered or somehow that this process will not work , totally defeats the fact that throughout the Cold War we made a whole series of agreements with the Soviet Union. President Reagan said in his best Russian, “ Doveryai, no proveryai,” “ Trust but v erify.” That ’s the basis of this agreement. This is nothing new here.",2.0
against," Tom, it ’s interesting . I mean, you know, these are stories you tell childre n to keep the nightmares away, that, “ Don’t worry, the Iranians will come clean . Don’t worry, the Iranians have come clean. ” But, Tom, you know better than anybody that the Iranians have been stonewalling the IAEA for years . There are 12 outstanding questions about past and possibly continuing military dimensions of the Iranian program. The head of the IAEA has made it very clear that he is deeply frustrated that Iran refuses to answer those 12 questions . They ’ve answered half of one, Tom . Half of one is not answering the questions . There are 11 and a half outstanding questions . We also know that the administration will give sanctions relief based on Iranian nuclear compliance, and that includes centrifuges, it includes Fordow , it includes some of the nuclear elements of this. So Iran is going to get sanctions relief before they ever have to come clean on all 12 dimensions of the weaponization efforts --Male Speaker: Thomas Pickering: Just not accurate, Mark.

As a result of sanctions relief that your administration -- that you were in -- negotiated , the economy is on its knees getting up to its feet. We ’ve lost economic leverage . Iran went from a severe recession to a modest recovery . When you l ose peaceful economic leverage, you lose the ability to actually negotiate strong nuclear concessions .

Now, the story that the Obama Administration told when it signed the interim agreement, is it said, “ Oh, the Supreme Leader is under such economic pressure, he ’s dying for an agreement . What he needs from us is a face -saving agreement . A face-saving agreement . So, we ’re going to rip up these Security Council resolutions, zero enrichment, zero reprocessing, and we are going to -- we are going to give him a face -saving nuclear enrichment program of 1,000 centrifuges. ” And then I heard from our European allies, a little bit later t he Americans came and said, “ It ’s not going to be 1,000, it ’s going to be 3,000.” A little bit later they came and said, “ No, 4,500. ” Now it ’s 6,104.

against,"Well, here ’s the problem . We have outlined a better deal . And one of the key elements of a better deal is that the restrictions of the Obama administration of putting on this program are not going to expire after 15 years . I mean, 15 years.

And that is that the restrictions will not sunset. They will not disappear until the International Atomic Energy Agency has reached a broader conclusion that Iran’s nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and there are no clandestine activities, which why not demand that?

It’s a state supporter of terrorism , and we don’t want to see the Iranian regime have more money at its disposable to pursue some of these activities . But as Tom reminded the group earlier on, this is a nuclear agreement . The reason these specific sanctions are in place -- the only reason we got the rest of the world to join these sanctions -- and, by the way, it was only when the rest of the world joined them that they became effective -- is that they were focused on Iran’s nuclear weapons program. Now, it seems to me what our opponents are suggest ing here, or those who don ’t want to move ahead with this deal, is that we focused it on the nuclear program to get international support for the sanctions, we brought down the Iranian economy, and then in the 11th hour we say, “ Oh, by the way, even though we ’ve gotten what we want on the nuclear side, let’s keep on the sanctions because we actually now want Iran to stop supporting terrorism, recognize Israel, stop messing around in Yemen -- ” and, let me just be cle ar, I’m for all of those things . 19:53: 07 We should be vigorously trying to pursue all of those goals, but the idea that we can just shift gears and say, “ We’re not even doing the deal until then, ” is a recipe not for getting both a nuclear deal and constraining Iran in the region, it’s a recipe for getting neither.",2.0

Hezbollah has 100,000 missiles and rockets that can -- that could hit Israel -- what are they doing about it ? They ’re not doing anything about it. All of the region, everyone in the region, all of our allies are up in arms, hair on fire about this issue, and the answer is , “Look, it ’s just a nuclear agreement. ” The only w ay this agreement makes sense, is what Kayvon asked here, is if the Obama administrationbelieves that if it kisses the frog it will turn into a prince, that through this economic -- through the economic transformation of Iran, through greater relief of sanctions and greater business opportunities Iran is going to miraculously transform into something other than what we know it to be. The Iranian regime has -- the Revolutionary Guard Corps has set up front companies that dominate the economy of Iran. They have positioned themselves very well to benefit from this . What we are doing, like I said, is making a deal with the mafia and assuming that it will become a legitimate businessman . There’s no reason to believe that.

The other possibility is we will certainly, as I point ed out a minute ago, know if they do. And we will have exactly the same retributive capabilities then as we have now . And in my view that is the arrangement that makes the most sense and the best deal that we have been able to get up until now, and our friends have shown us absolutely no way to improve the deal. I would love to find ways to improve the deal, but I am totally satisfied that the deal we have now on the table is a deal which we can certainly live with and that we will have every opportunity to assure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.

You know, the world, as Iran started to do enrichment and move toward the potential weapons capability, go back to 2003, de cided that the outcome had to be zero enrichment. And we insisted on that, and we insisted on that as they increased from, at the time, 160 centrifuges . And we said, “ No, it has to be zero. ” Then they got up to 3,000, we said “It has to be zero. ” And they had 6,000, “It has to be zero. ” And we ’ve done that all the way to 19,000 . So we could, as you suggest, and as I think Mike and Mark would suggest, keep choking . While we choke -- you know, we could take that gamble . As I said before, we could have showed up at the talks in the first day, said “The only out come here is zero enrichment, no civilian reactors and fill Fordo w with cement and let us go anywhere, anytime , including your military bases. ” We could have said t hat.

We didn’t have to sti ck at zero enrichment, but we could have offered exactly what President Obama offered in the beginning, which was 500 to 1,000 centrifuges . Why the willingness on the part of the United States to continue to diminish our nuclear demands step by step? The fact is that the Iranians fear U.S. escalation dominance . They began in 2003 negotiating the Europeans over 13 years . They only increased their operating centrifuges by 9 ,500. That’s about 700 centrifuges a year . They increased their program increment ally. They fear escalation dominance . They fear our crippling sanctions . They fear our military power. And so you ’re right, we could have actually increased our sanctions, but we could have done so in an incremental way . We could have ratcheted up the pressure . And most importantly, we could have stuck to our nuclear demands . Why the rush, you ask ? The rush is because President Obama has 18 months left in his term.

We will come forward with a set of ideas and principles for t he negotiation that will deal effectively with the problem of your suspicion about our nuclear weapon . And we will accept inspections, a wide variety of them. And we want sanctions relief . And if we cannot achieve this with you in a reasonable period of time, we won ’t be back. ” And that’s, in fact, what has happened, interestingly enough . And that’s where we are now. A second story: T wo weeks ago I had the opportunity on successive days to hear again from the lead negotiators on both sides. And as Philip mentioned just a moment ago, each one of them said to us, “ This is a good deal for the following reasons, ” and the Iranian reasons were, guess what, quite friendly to the Iranian point of view and ignored the question of the maj or negotiating concessions they had to make . The Americans were less so but, nevertheless, reflected their view . But when I sat down just as the Belfer Center sat down, I could not find any reason to believe that what they had said was so inc onsistent that, in fact, we didn’t have a deal very close to in hand, and that nothing contravened the framework .We now have a new opportunity in the region, but we have a new opportunity first with Iran n ow, to stop any eff ort toward a nuclear weapon .

It calls to mind Ronald Reagan in 1987, when he appeared before the American people and he said, “ Three months ago I told you that I didn’t trade arms for hostages with Iran . Today, my heart and my best intentions still tell me that that is true . Bu t the evidence has shown that actually something else is true . I did trade arms for hostages.” Now, who traded the arms for hostages ? Who was involved in that deal ? You may recall, for those of you who ar e old enough, that Bud McFarlane , the former National Security Advisor, and Ollie North, of the Iran -Contra scandal, went to Iran with a plane -load of weapons . And they delivered it to the Iranians . And in return, the Iranians gave up hostages that were held by Hezbollah in Lebanon. What was the thinking behind it ? The thinking behind it was “We ’re not trading arms for hostages . What we’re doing is we ’re finding the moderates in Tehran. We’re making -- we ’re reaching out across the political divide with them, and we ’re going -- we ’re go ing to create a new relationship .

Now you just have to decide if it ’s good for America or not.” Now, maybe Mister, Madame President -- Mike and Mark have persuaded you it’s not good for America and you should reject it . And if you do, maybe we’ll put on more sanctions, and somehow the world will follow us, even though we walked away from the agreement . And maybe Iran will then come back to the table and agree to zero or 500 centrifuges . And maybe they ’ll get rid of their heavy water reactor anyway . And maybe they’ll accept anytime, anywhere inspections, including military bases . And maybe they’ll recognize Israel and stop terrorism. Maybe all that will happen, speaking of fantasies -- because y ou thought this deal wasn’t good and you rejected it, and you hoped all those things would happen, Mister, Madame President. On the other hand, maybe we ’ll walk away . We won ’t be able to keep the international sanctions coalition together . Iran will sta rt resuming all of those things it stopped doing with the joint plan of action, stockpiling 20 percent uranium, spinning 10,000, 19,000 centrifuges and more, finishing the heavy water reactor at Arak . And at that point, you -- and think about this veryse riously -- will be faced with a choice . Either you acquiesce and let them finish that heavy water reactor and build more centrifuges, or use military force to stop it, which would have all sorts of other consequences in the region.
