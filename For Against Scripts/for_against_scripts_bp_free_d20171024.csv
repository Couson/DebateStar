for,"Thank you, John. Tonight, you're going to hear Christine and Len argue that mandatory enforcement of amateurism is a bulwark against the forces of over-commercialization that threaten to destroy college sports. They'll ask you to ignore the fact that college sports are already hyper-commercialized with billion-dollar TV contracts and events like the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl. But to economists like me and almost any economist not on the NCAA's payroll, the NCAA's enforcement of amateurism is not noble. It's the classic conduct of an anti-competitive cartel. A cartel is a set of independent firms -- here, the member colleges and universities of the NCAA -- that fix prices in a market where they would otherwise compete. Cartels are illegal in the United States. People go to jail for price-fixing and firms have been punished for attempting to fix the price they pay their workers. In the 1990s, one cartel that was trying to fix wages was punished by a federal court, which said -- and this is a quote -- ""the cartel ultimately robbed suppliers of the normal fruits of their enterprises."" That cartel was the NCAA, which had tried to fix the wages that were paid to coaches by the schools. And they said, ""Well, we need to, because we have to preserve amateurism. We need to save costs."" And the court said, ""Those may be fine goals, but they don't override the coach's right to seek employment in competition among the schools that would employ him or her."" And so, my proposition to you is, rather than voting yes to the simple ""Pay college athletes,"" I want you tonight to vote yes to the idea that college athletes, like their coaches, have the right to a market free of collusion, like all of us do under the law. Tonight, you may hear the argument that if college athletes are paid, that suddenly and magically they'll stop being students. That's nonsense. Students in college get paid all the time. They work in the library. They work in the bookstore. They get paid if they're in student government. They get paid for -- on the school newspaper. One of my roommates in college got paid a commission every time he placed an ad in the school yearbook. Emma Watson was at Brown University when she made many of her ""Harry Potter"" movies as Hermione Granger, and she was paid an exorbitant salary because she was able to access a free market. We might not have approved of how much money she got. We may have been worried that she would have spent the money frivolously or maybe even dangerously, but we didn't deny her, her adult right to go into the market and seek compensation free of collusion. That same adult right has been denied to college athletes. So, where Emma Watson was treated like an adult, DeShawn Watson, who won the national championship at Clemson, was not. Instead, he was told he could have a fixed price, and that was it. I'm not here to argue that every college must pay every athlete. Instead, my proposition is simple -- that college athletes have the same right of market access as their coaches, and as the rest of us here, and that we have let them -- that right be usurped by the NCCA through collusion. Should we pay college athletes is a really arrogant question. Who are we to tell a group of people whether they can or can't earn a living under the same rights that the rest of us have? A better question is, if there were no collusion, would college athletes get paid? And if the answer to that is yes, then you know they're being exploited -- because their pay is being held down by a cartel. So, would they get paid? Of course, the answer is yes. One answer -- one reason we know this is because college athletes are already paid. In exchange for their athletic services, they are provided with room, board, tuition. And since about 2015, they get about $400 a month in cash as well. This is not a free education. It's a quid pro quo -- services for services. Athletics for education. Now, Joe is going to talk about whether that education is being provided fairly or not. But my point here is that in a market, if schools were not bound by NCAA collusion, they would offer athletes every single bit of education they offer them today, and education. It's not an either/or. It's a both and. And anything else you hear about this tonight ends up being a quibble when you think about it being a fundamental right. So, one quibble you might hear is that Alabama and Ohio State will get all the best football players and Kentucky and Duke will get all the best basketball players. But that happens now. There's actually very good economics that shows that fixing prices hurts competitive balance; it doesn't help it. You may hear doctored NCAA statistics that nobody makes any money -- but there's plenty of money when the coach needs $500 million pay, the assistant coach needs a million dollars. And the good news is that unlike coaches' pay, as athlete pay rises for men, Title IX ensures that an equivalent amount will be dedicated to women. So, what we'll see is a sort ofTitle IX 2.0. If you hear the myth that compensation and education just aren't compatible, please listen carefully. It's about something about who's getting the money -- why is it okay for Emma Watson to get the money, and Katie Ledecky to be paid to swim while she's at Stanford, but it's not okay for DeShawn Watson or for Richard Sherman to get paid to play football while he's at Stanford? Finally, don't fall for the fact that no one will watch. If no one will watch, then no one will pay, because pay in a market is driven by businesses' desire to attract customers. And so, if in your mind, you suspect that, if allowed to, colleges would pay, then what you're saying is that you know that fans would still attend. And that's why I want you to answer ""Yes"" to the proposition, because athletes deserve the right to find out the answer, what they're worth.",
against,"Pay for play is a cop-out. It teaches nothing. It infects the true mission of sports and higher education, and you got to consider this. There is no right to play college sports. There is no statutory, natural, or God-given right. No one forces the athletes to play. There are options that exist for basketball and even football players to play somewhere other than college. It's a benefactor/beneficiary relationship, where the athletes, as beneficiaries, accept the conditions set forth by the benefactors, in exchange for the benefits that include free education, free world-class training. Now, if you quantify those benefits -- room, board, books, tuition, cost of attendance, stipends -- which can sometimes go as high as $6,000 -- then add medical benefits, world-class coaching, training in world-class facilities, the ability to build a brand on national TV. How much would those benefits be worth on an open market? Now, no one can argue that the NCAA has done it perfectly, but no one can reasonably argue that these benefits don't have significant value. The mission of higher education is leadership development. Competition against similarly situated folks on a plain surface in front of crowds is a dynamic element of leadership development. That kind of pressure yields diamonds even among athletes who never make it to the pros. Few college students have that opportunity. Pay for play blows up that mission with its distractions. Only tuition is tax free. You know, any benefit not directly attached to the education mission is taxable, but the IRS just looks the other way for now. Imagine every athlete having to file a tax return. That just adds to the burdens that college athletes already have. Pay for play destroys the pro social benefits of college sports. Ninety-six percent of the revenue derived from tickets and media sales go back to the institutions who in turn utilize it for programs that work to the benefit of student athletes. The revenue serves the greater good. That includes supporting division two, supporting division three, subsidizing nonrevenue sports with money for scholarships and other beneficial programs. Now, pay for play obliterates the line between sports and -- pro sports and college sports. College sports galvanize small city and big city communities, college communities. The academic and sports success of beneficiaries lead benefactors to contribute more. And the success of the beneficiaries through graduation, earning a degree, and post sports and college success leads them to become benefactors through foundations, through other ways that they contribute to the community causes. And, yes, it is a social and racial justice issue, however, not for the reasons our opponents have stated. You know, black athletes carried a burden of academic failure in revenue-generating sports. Fifteen years ago, the graduation rate for African-American basketball players was 46 percent. Today, according to the graduation success rate, it is now 77 percent. Now, those numbers can improve, but guess what. They were done without paying a single dime of pay for play. Now, nevertheless, the growth over those 15 years is something that people marvel at. But the bottom line is it's just a shiny object that draws these athletes out momentarily. But it gives them nothing as far as future survival. You've heard from the opposition, ""Fair value,"" or college athletes, or you will. How about focusing on valuing education fairly. For people of color, particularly black athletes, education is resistance. What better than a degree to help you prepare and resist the ravages of racism in a world that essentially is hostile to you because of the color of your skin? It's time we viewed pay for play as a sarcastic deterrent and payoff to deter that type of resistance. Now, if you were distracted by all this fake money, imagine what it's going to do to an 18-year-old who thinks that he or she is going to college to get paid as opposed to getting a higher education? The corruption in college sports that we probably will touch on has its roots fueled by money. But rather than destroy those roots, pay for play deepens them. Every ill that has been mentioned and will be mentioned by the proponents of pay for play can be cured by controlling spending, continued academic reform, and assuring that direct commercial success inures to the benefit of the college athlete first and foremost to health, safety, and welfare not by substituting a fix in amounts that probably will have less impact than an earned degree on the lives of these athletes. And, for that reason, I urge you guys to vote, ""No,"" on this proposition.",1.0
for,"  I've got a lot to say here, but I'm going to start by just summing up what Len said. Let's exploit black college football and men's basketball players for the greater good of everybody else. That's the bottom line. Now I have six points I want to get through, so I need to get moving, but I'm going to start where Len started, education. So, a free education is supposed to be what you get and it's what the NCAA promises. In fact, it says on the website ""In the collegiate model of sports the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second."" And Len says that the college education is so valuable that an athlete should be thrilled to have this as his only form of compensation and should ignore how much more the market might provide. You know, here's the deal. Education should be their trump card, but it's actually the reason you should vote with us. Because far too many college football and men's basketball players simply don't get a real education or anything close to it. So, you've read about the University of North Carolina scandal. Twenty years, fake classes.  No professor. No class. One paper which is graded by the administrator.  And not only did the NCAA say that this was okay that it didn't violate any rules, they called it a benefit, a benefit to the athlete. The thing about that, fake classes are a benefit to athletes who are there to get an education. Explain how that works. Explain how that's right. Now, race. Race is an important, important subtext of this whole conversation. The University of Auburn, 3.2 percent of the undergraduates are African American. Seventy-eight percent of the football and men's basketball players are African American. There are similar stats at places like every big-time sports school practically, Ohio State, Florida, University of Louisville. Sometimes close to half of all division one football athletes receive PEL grants, which are reserved for the lowest income families in America. A college education is supposed to be life changing, but listen to some statistics, some real statistics, not the phonied up NCAA graduation statistics, which by the way, don't count any athlete who drops out. That's the graduation statistic doesn't count athletes who drop out. Think about that one for a second. In the big 10, black men's basketball players have a graduation rate of -- that is 36 percent lower than non-athletes. The big 12, minus 42 percent. The mountain west, minus 51 percent. Michigan State 33 percent of black male athletes graduate in six years compared to 78 percent of non-athletes. And a lot of those who do graduate major in something called eligibility, i.e., they just take any class that the academic advisor sends them to so that they -- so they can stay on the field. This is exploitation. I don't even know how else you can call it anything else. They've been recruited to the campus for one reason, one reason, to generate revenue for the university. That's why they're there. You can't say that about anybody else on campus, including I might add, hockey players and baseball players who don't generate revenue. So now they're going to say now they're non-employees because they're quote unquote ""student athletes,"" right? They're not employees. But when the NLRB in Chicago held a hearing to discuss whether the Northeastern football team qualified under the law as employees, they wound up saying yes, they did. They work 60 hours a week. Their boss, their coach, controls almost every aspect of their lives. They are employees. They can't take classes that get in the way of their sport. That's why they're there. Now, student athlete. I got to do this quickly because I'm running out of time. You're going to hear that phrase a lot, student athlete. You know where it comes from?  The NCAA made it up because some states were thinking of giving badly injured football players Workman's Comp. So, the idea is if you call everybody student athlete they'll think they're students and they're not employees and therefore they won't get student -- Workman's Comp no matter how badly they're hurt. That's a really fair system, don't you think? We've talked -- everybody agrees that college sports is a huge business. It's actually a $13 billion business, just a little bit less than the NFL, and you know, we're all talking about how much money the coaches make. ESPN is paying $7.3 billion to televise the new college football playoffs. That's three games a season. Three games. So why is it okay to have a business that maximizes revenue in every aspect, but the labor force is supposed to be free? How is that right? I want to talk finally about scandals. So, we have -- every scandal revolves around money. Somebody's passing money to somebody under the table. That's what happens over and over and over and over. The latest one is the Louisville Scandal where, among other things, a marketer for Adidas was paying a player $100,000 to get him to go to the University of Louisville where Adidas has paid, by the way, $160 million to put the uniforms and the shoes on the athletes of all the -- of all the teams. The NCAA finds this horrifying. It's a huge scandal. It's terrible. But think about what kind of scandal this is. This is like prohibition. Drinking was against the law during prohibition until they changed the law and then drinking was fine again. That's what's going on here. If you vote with us, you're voting for a system that is healthier, fairer, more honest, and more just. ",1.0
against,"Thank you, John.  Well, thanks for being here, everybody. It's a real delight to be up here with four friends. And I do have to give Joe and Andy some credit here. I'm going to give you your props right away, you've used the word, ""women,"" as well as men in this conversation because, folks, let me tell you this. When you have heard the conversation about paying athletes, what have you heard, the words, ""basketball,"" and, ""football."" They haven't used the word, ""pesky"" -- the pesky adjective, ""men's,"" have they, men's basketball? No, no, it's been basketball and football as if there's no other sports that exist. So, I have to give you guys credit for talking about women because can you imagine a place, a time in this country, where you could pay men but not pay women? And, in reality, that is what this conversation has been. Guys, again, all props to you for mentioning women, for acknowledging that women play sports. But when we hear this argument over and over again, ladies and gentlemen, it's about men. 2017, we're going to pay men but not women? And I know you guys said, ""We will."" You talk to any athletic director in the country and they're thinking, ""Wow, how in the world do we do this? How do we pay field hockey as well as football?"" You have to under Title IX. Or, if you don't, if the idea is all about revenue producing and we're only going to pay the people that supposedly make money, if you do that, well then think of the Title IX lawsuits. You will just have hundreds and hundreds of lawsuits in this country as there should be if, in fact, you're not paying women equal to men. That is a conversation, and that's one of the things that I would like to focus on with my teammate Len, here, is what is this going to look like? What is this going to look like? So, ""Okay, let's pay them. Let's pay everybody."" I've got some college football fans here? Shout out one of your -- your school you cheer for. Anyone cheers for Alabama?  Another one? There you go. Wow, there you go. Len, I think we got his vote. So, you guys are from Maryland. You've got an offensive tackle. Now we're paying them. We're paying, what, 100,000 a year? And all of a sudden Auburn says, ""You know, we need an offensive tackle,"" halfway through the season,"" and we'll pay him 150,000 a year."" So there goes your offensive tackle, right, if you can move around? Now, maybe you have rules, right? And you say, ""Well, you can't move except for a year or two. Think about that. Think about the money, as if we need more money in sports, and what will that look like? Len mentioned, of course, paying taxes, all these kids now having to pay taxes, the field hockey players moving from here to there because they don't like their job, the way you might want to move halfway through a year in a job that you're in, the chaos that that could leave for everyone. And as fans of football, there is something to say, ""Hey, when that punter is out there on the field and you're cheering for him, that he was in a chemistry class as you were."" And I know our friends are saying, ""Oh, they'll still take classes."" Really, really? Yeah, that would be wonderful if they do, but the odds are, if they're there for the money, it's minor league sports and they're just going to want to obviously play football or whatever the sport is for the money. It would be great to have them in class, but will they? I was with a whole group of big 10 people, actually, on an Alaska cruise and I asked this question. I said -- these are super fans. They've spent money to go to Alaska. They have season tickets. I said, ""Would it change football for you, and men's basketball for you, if we were paying everybody?"" And I asked for a show of hands and every single person, Iowa, Purdue, Minnesota, Ohio State, Maryland, Northwestern, where I went to school, everyone said it would change it for them. They would be less likely to support it. They would be less likely to go and cheer for it. So, those are just the facts, folks. You know, the other thing that we hear a lot from our friends on the other side of this issue is the conversation about athletes not being compensated. And Len referred to a little bit of this. But I just want to make sure I make this point clearly. Forbes Money -- who knows exactly what the dollar figure is -- Forbes said that $2 million dollars-plus, over four years, for a football player, that the value of that education and that experience at a college -- 2 million plus. USA Today, my newspaper, men's basketball -- a half million dollars, they figure, over the four years. Again, what is that? Len mentioned it. Elite coaching. Tutoring, training, food, medicine, all of those wonderful things. The exposure on Saturday night to show your wares, so that someday, a future employer can see what you're doing and hire you. What would the violinist in the symphony -- in the school symphony give to be on TV every Saturday night, so that you could watch her do her thing -- playing the violin so that she could someday be hired by a symphony? What is the value of being on network TV over and over, as football and men's basketball is? Maybe someday we will have the Violinist Channel.  But right now, we don't. But think about the value of that and what these student athletes have now. And I -- the last thing in the last minute that I have here is that we hear that money is floating all over -- around -- of course, all over the place.  Are college coaches paid exorbitant amounts? That's not the conversation for today. I think all four of us could agree the answer is yes. These college coaches -- football coaches, men's basketball -- are paid through the roof. That's not what we're debating here today. We're debating about the funds that are there. And according to USA Today, 23 programs are self-sufficient, 23. Not hundreds. And I know we may disagree on this, gentlemen, but the reality is that for all the money that they're bringing in, so many of them are spending it, and there's 23. The Ohio States, the Michigans, the Floridas, the Texas, the -- you know, those are the schools that are making the money. The rest are not balancing out. So, this idea that there's money just floating around there to pay everyone -- we're finding that's just not the case. So, anyway, thanks so much for listening. Hope you vote with us, and on we go.

And, you know, we talk about anecdotes and Joe throws out a lot of anecdotes and I think it might be intellectually dishonest to say don't listen to the NCAA stats and don't believe this, but where's the proof that they're wrong? All we've had are anecdotes instead of patterns and as a lawyer I deal more with trends and patterns than just anecdotes to illustrate my points.

That is a right embedded in law and the idea here is that when -- I don’t have a right to play college sports, but I do have a right if I go to college to say I want you to tell me how much my scholarship is going to be worth without colluding with others. The same thing happened in the Ivy League around the time that I was applying. All of the Ivy League schools colluded on how much merit aid they would give at zero.

And I don't know if people know this, but I'm just in the process of starting a league, and we actually wrote to the Department of Education, and said, ""If we pay male athletes, what's the implication for the female athletes at the schools that we're working with?"" And they wrote back, saying, ""You have to match dollar-for-dollar."" It's not exactly dollar-for-dollar, but close enough. And so, this is why I say that if we let the market open up, and athletic directors decide that their fans can tolerate, say, $100,000 a player, what that means is that they have to make sure they budget $100,000 times 13 for women's sports too -- if we're talking about basketball. And if they can't afford that, then they have to lower the amount the pay the men -- male players to make sure they comply with the law, because federal law dominates here.

Other players fought. Marvin Miller, the union head fought. People said, owners said, fans said this will destroy baseball. This will be the worst thing that ever happens to baseball if players get free agency and they can go from one team and another and they can argue for their own money, for their own paycheck.

You can make sure that the commercial dollars inure to the benefit of the health, safety, and welfare of the student athlete. And the way you do that, in my opinion -- and I've been calling for this for years -- is get an anti-trust exemption. Now, you know, we've heard Andy talk about, you know, cartels, they're illegal, blah, blah, blah. The Supreme Court has had great opportunities since '84, when they decided a case that gave football back to the conferences as opposed to NCAA authority. They've had ample opportunity to outlaw the whole thing. But there's one hitch -- education mission. And even in the O'Bannon case, the education mission prevented them from paying the student athletes the $5,000. Now, you know, I'm a believer in name, image, and likeness -- that is a natural right.

So, the NCAA recognized the error of their ways, but those things -- right now the NCAA is dying a death by a thousand litigation cuts. It's like the Wild West. You hear us go back and forth, back and forth about authority. In the Wild West, you know, they got what? Marshall Dillon who had total authority to clean the place up.

There is not a single current athlete on the committee. There is not a single person who believes an athlete's rights on the committee. It's every single person is employed by a university, is involved in the system. It is the classic example of if you let the fox run in the hen house you're not going to have a lot of hens left. The idea of shielding the NCAA from about the only force that's forced change, which is the anti-trust law, until -- for fourty years from -- when you were in school you were able to get $15. For fourty years they banned the $15 a month because they said it was contrary to amateurism even though when you were there it was fine, in 2015 finally the O'Bannon case changed it and they said oh well, no one's going to pay it.

Because when you take a look, the marker for socioeconomic description in college is first generation, either your mother or your father went to college. Today only one in seven athletes, I think 19 percent in basketball, maybe 20 percent in football, are first generation. And what does that mean? That means that from a socioeconomic standpoint they're not disadvantaged. And why is that gentrification happening? The rising academic standards, the cost of training to get to college, and finally, it really comes down to the middle class that can afford that. Now, in the end it comes down to the fact that colleges with the APR, they don't want to recruit kids that can't get a certain GPA and the ones who are in college for the most part, and I'm not talking about football, maybe football is a little more difficult, but when they recruit kids they want to get kids who can do the work so that their APR can remain above the level before they get penalized. So, if they're not doing the work then it's not because they're not capable of doing the work, and that's why I say I think they're distracted. I think that many instances as a college basketball broadcaster, I talked to these kids. I look around. I want to go see where they're going to class and what they're doing and oftentimes, you know, they're not being held accountable and that's the one thing we haven't heard, personal accountability. You know, I talk about being -- own it. You know, be an advocate. If you want it. All too often guys are coming in thinking I'm going to the pros. I'm going to make money. I'm Ben Simmons. I can go for one semester and go to class and then after that because I'm going to the pros I don't have to go to school anymore. Okay, this may be another topic for another day. Because it -- but no -- but I do think there's some -- a little side note on this -- -- that might be important, is that this is discussed a lot of what does football mean to a school. And a lot of people I know -- this is anecdotal. It is not -- I don't have this on a spreadsheet anywhere. They go for homecoming and then they go, and they write a check for biology the next day. They feel really good about being around the football team. They saw their friends. Football is the place to go. So, there's a lot there and I appreciate your question. Go ahead, Len. Can I just answer real quickly? It's because, and we keep forgetting the phrase, ""Education mission."" You may not like it, but it's going to carve out throughout these Supreme Court cases. Even Justice Wilkins in the O'Bannon Case said that these issues could be better addressed as a policy matter by reforms other than those available as a remedy for antitrust violation. Such reforms and remedies could be undertaken by the NCAA, members, schools, conferences, or Congress. And that means essentially that the carve-out for education mission makes it different than the commercial element that you're talking about no matter how much commercialism occurs. And it all started with the 1984 case.",2.0
for,I'm okay. There were a couple of students at Stanford. They invented a little thing called Google and they got rich. And IP belongs to students and so should -- so should the economic value of playing sports.,2.0
for,"I can see that some of you in the audience recently graduated from college. Others, maybe you have kids or grandkids who graduated from college recently. And you may be thinking to yourself, ""Gosh, I wish my slow, short kid had been exploited like those big, burly athletes were."" And the thing is that exploitation is not about some level. It's about the gap between what you get and what you're worth. And if your kid only got a half scholarship for merit, that's because that was the supply and demand factors that led to that and the school gave your kid what your kid was worth or gave you what you were worth. And the only people that that's not happening to right now are college athletes and it's because of collusion. We live in a market economy. We might like the socialist economy, but we don't live in that and it is an odd spot that suddenly we become very, very socialistic when we're talking about college sports. And so, I think it's important to think about exploitation here. The idea that an education is not valuable is not what I stand for. I have three degrees. I think education is extremely valuable. Exploitation is about getting less than your worth. If an education is worth a zillion dollars, and 100,000 more. It's all about the gap. And so, I'd like to leave you with this final thought about the word, ""enough."" ""Isn't it enough if they get a scholarship?"" Enough is a standard that we reserve for people who could receive charity, for children, and for chattel. When somebody owns a horse, and gives the horse enough oats, combs it well, we say, ""What a good owner,"" and we think enough is good for the horse. But we let the horse's owner earn as much as she can running the horse in races. And so, I want you to vote yes for the proposition: Pay College Athletes, because I think we should treat college athletes like the humans and not the horse in my analogy. And so, I want you to think about what it means if the standard that you're using for yourself is ""I get what I earn,"" and the standard that you're using for collegiates is, ""It's enough,"" what that means.",3.0
against,"  No one ever said it's enough. In fact, we've said more can be done. The current system needs to be changed. I talked about anti-trust litigation -- anti-trust exemption to keep the current system but allow an authority to be able to make it fairer. At this point in time, one of the reasons it's -- the optics are bad is because there's no authority that can change it. You know, throwing out the baby with the bathwater by just paying people and going away -- to me that's almost degrading. You know, when you talk about -- and the word ""indentured"" -- I understand what you're saying, but you know, we have the cover of a book. We have people likening this to indentured servitude and slavery. You know, that to me is simply for shock value. Who can say that getting an education, a degree, and being able to move on -- even if you play pro sports -- who can say that that's slavery? And just because other people are making more money -- that's going to happen in this real world. But the bottom line is, this is leadership development. This is still education. And no matter how many anecdotes we come up with that talk about the idea of poor classes, et cetera -- there are hundreds that do it the other way. Josh Dobbs, quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, 3.5 GPA in aerospace engineering. Myron Rolle, a Rhodes Scholar, football player, played in the NFL and then he went on to be a neurosurgeon. Len Elmore, an attorney, a college basketball player, had the opportunity. If they were paying us, do you really think, at 17, 18 years old, our focus would be on what -- on what we ultimately became? Think about that.",3.0
for,"I -- you walk into the college bookstores, and you see your jersey. And it's being sold for $50, $60, 70 bucks, and you're not getting any of it. That's really leadership development, don't you think? That really teaches you a lot about how the world works. It does actually teach you a lot about how the world works. There's a deep cynicism among many athletes, because they watch the system where everybody, where there's money pouring, and they're getting none of it. I listened to our opponents talk tonight about all the things that would be so difficult about paying the athletes. Taxes, competitive balance, Title IX, contracts. These are all solvable problems. And not only are they solvable, they're actually pretty easy to solve. You just have to want to do it. And everybody in College Sports Inc. -- which is what I call it -- is resistant this idea because the current system works for them. So, they don't really care how it works for the athlete. I want to finish on this point. In the early stages of the fake class scandal at the University of North Carolina, a distinguished professor of history named Harry Winston wrote a letter to an alumnus who was upset that the scandal had become such a big deal. And here's part of what he wrote. ""We entice these players to entertain the public and enrich their coaches by performing a vast amount of arduous, dangerous, and unpaid work with the opportunity for a free education and a distant chance to go pro as their only compensation. Then we set up conditions which make the education either meaningless or nearly unattainable. To me, this situation is fundamentally immoral."" If you want to start infusing some morality into this situation, not to mention some sanity -- some acknowledgment of reality, and some justice, you need to start paying the players. ",3.0
against,"Well thank you, John. Thank you, guys. What a delight it has been. It's been a lot of fun, hasn't it? I think we've all learned a lot and we thank you so much for being here and for tolerating our opinions. You know, I think it really comes down to you've heard enough. I mean, I could just sit down right now. You guys have your ideas, but it's almost a cynicism about well, college scholarship isn't worth enough. We're not doing enough. This wonderful thing we've set up, which is college sports, which so many of you enjoy, oh, that's not good enough. I know it sounds probably like I'm saying the sky is falling if it's going to be different. Folks, it's going to be different and we may ruin it to pay athletes when in fact they're already getting so much in our humble opinion with those scholarships. And it's easy for me to stand here and say that to you, but let me take you to two days ago when I was at my alma mater, Northwestern University, and I started a mentoring program for female student athletes and now it's male and female student athletes and so I was talking with 20 or 30 students speed networking and dinner and what have you and each and every one of them, some football players at Northwestern, women's soccer, men's soccer, women's golf, swimming, you name it. Every single one of them was so appreciative of the opportunity they were getting. This great education at a wonderful university, I'm very biased. They get a chance to play a sport they love, and they get a chance in this case to meet so many professionals that can help them with jobs and internships and be launched into the lifetime of their dreams. They, when I asked them about this, they said we don't need to be paid. We're here and we're getting a college scholarship and we're getting an education that is going to change our lives. Those were their words, not mine. And I'll leave you with that.  Take care.",3.0
