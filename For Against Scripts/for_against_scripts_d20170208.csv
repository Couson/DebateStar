for,"Hello, John. Thank you, John. It's true that my family had fought battles with the Saud, but I can't claim that I personally participated in this battle. Yes, this is precisely the kind of answer or question that I get from Saudi apologists who don't have actually a legitimate response to what I have to say or write. Yes. My partner in the debate, Mark -- Ambassador Mark Lagon. So Freedom House rates every country in the world on political freedom and on civil liberties from one being best to seven being worst. And just last week, the annual scores came out, and Saudi Arabia was a seven on both in the worst, meaning repressing dissent or repressing women, repressing minority face -- Indeed.",nan
against,"John, I think it won't be any less complicated. We don't have that kind of power up here, but I think that folks will understand the complications a little bit better and I think they'll understand why the relationship with Saudi Arabia continues to be in America's best interest. My partner is the very experienced and very talented Ambassador James Jeffrey. Not at all, John. He's got the best job in the world. I've had the privilege of working with him at times and he's going to do great.",nan
for,"Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I'm very happy to be here and present the motion. I will argue that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has indeed outlived its usefulness. In support of the motion I will cover the domestic and regional considerations, and my partner, Ambassador Mark Lagon, will cover the subsequently the international and global aspects of the bilateral relationship. Before I get started I'd like to make an important point. The domestic consideration that I will consider today cannot be discussed in isolation as some would have it, internal matters of for Saudi Arabia are not really for the country itself. We live in a global world and so many things are interconnected from terrorism to oil. We can't isolate the domestic from the international; however, we have a very good division of labor between the two of us and I will cover the first part of this debate and it deals with internal dynamics. So, one thing to remember is that whatever happens inside Saudi Arabia does not stay within the borders of Saudi Arabia and has implication for the U.S. and also for that matter the whole world. The U.S.-Saudi relationship was dubbed from the very beginning as a special relationship. From the moment American President Roosevelt met King ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia on the 14th of February 1945. At the core of this relationship were two issues. First, oil and second one is security. The special relationship meant that the U.S. offered Saudi Arabia uncritical, unequivocal, and unconditional support for more than seven decades. We will argue that this is no longer in the U.S.'s best national interest. Let me just explain how this relationship developed. In the 1960s, Saudi Arabia was a very useful ally during the cold war. Its oil wealth, its strategic location -- and believe it or not, its conservative Islamic tradition -- all helped to defend against, and ultimately defeat, nationalism and communism, not only in the Arab world, but also in the Muslim world in general. This special relationship meant that Saudi Arabia became important for the U.S., and even more so, after 1979. So, why 1979? Remember, in 1979, the main ally of the U.S., the Shah of Iran, was toppled. And we get to the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And at that moment, U.S.-Iranian relations became extremely difficult and hostile. And in fact, they have never been resolved until the present day. It is still a troubled relationship. So, the U.S. decided to put all its baskets in the -- all its eggs, sorry -- in the Saudi basket. And therefore, this relationship became even more special. And we leave that moment to come to Afghanistan in the 1980s. And here, the U.S.-Saudi alliance became extremely important. And also, Saudi Arabia used its conservative Islam in order to start what is regarded today as the menace -- and the menace is the global jihadi movement that brewed in the caves of Afghanistan. But then it spread across the globe, and I do not need to remind you of the details. Today, this special relationship has become counterproductive. Unconditional U.S. support for this absolute monarchy is now against U.S. national interests. The absolute monarchy of Saudi Arabia has become difficult to sustain. First, this regime oppresses its own people, marginalizes women, discriminates against religious minorities, spreads lethal conservative religious ideology, interferes in domestic affairs of its neighbors, and aspires to become a hawkish regional superpower. This doesn't help U.S. interests, but actually harms them. Unconditional U.S. support legitimizes the regime and authoritarianism, and makes the U.S. vulnerable to accusations of double standards -- supporting dictatorship in one country while promoting human rights and democracy in other countries. More than that -- since 9/11, many Americans have asked legitimate questions. Given that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudis, Americans began to ask, ""Are Saudis our friends or foe?"" This was a legitimate question, given that Saudi Arabia spawned more than three-quarters of the terrorists who perpetrated the most horrific acts against America in modern history.",nan
against,"Thanks, everybody, for coming out. We're going to divide up the defense of this motion, not according to domestic and international, because we actually think that the whole point of this motion is about the value of this relationship to the United States. And so, we're going to focus on the value that Saudi Arabia and the relationship with Saudi Arabia brings. I'm going to talk about probably the most telling point that Madawi brought up, the two most telling points: Values and the spread of this very conservative xenophobic, intolerant version of Islam that we short handedly call ""Wahhabism."" And Jim is going to talk more about American interests in strategy and in oil and in other elements. So it seems to me that if the argument's about values, they win, we walk off the stage. Saudi Arabia does not share our values. We are very happy to stipulate that. But the question here is not for us about values, it's about interests. If we ran our Middle East policy based only on dealing with people who shared our values, we really wouldn't have many people to talk to in the Middle East. The Middle East is a very strategic area. It's in flames right now. And having a relationship with a stable country in the Middle East that has influence in Syria, in Yemen, in other parts -- in Iraq, in other parts of the Middle East that are in flames we think is actually very useful to the United States. But I think Madawi, my friend Madawi -- and we've known each other for a long time. I think my friend Madawi's best argument here is the fact that Saudi Arabia has been the home of Wahhabism and that Wahhabism has become, in its various incarnations once it left the country, a threat to the United States. So there is a logic to this, undoubtedly. But I don't think that that logic holds through the entire argument. And let me tell you why. It's more complicated than that. It's nice to look for a single cause, for any phenomenon, particularly a troubling phenomenon like the Salafi jihadist movement in that al-Qaeda and ISIS, they're Salafi jihadists. That's what specialists call them. It's always nice to try to find the one silver bullet that's the cause for this, and then you can go against it. But I don't think that that's ever right, right? Salafi jihadism is the product of an enormous number of factors, and Madawi mentioned a very important one, the success of the jihad in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. That was supported by Saudi Arabia, also supported by the United States. You might remember President Reagan calling the leaders of this jihad, the mujahedeen. He compared them to the Founding Fathers of the United States, right? Lots of Saudis have joined ISIS, but lots of Tunisians have joined ISIS, Tunisia, the one success story of the Arab Spring, the most democratic of the Arab countries emerging from the Arab Spring. Europeans have joined ISIS, even some Americans. It's hard to say that Wahhabism was the thing that drove them to join ISIS. I think that the fact of the matter is the Saudis lost control of global Salafism, they lost control of Wahhabism once it left their borders. And in fact, these people in ISIS and al-Qaeda, who share some beliefs with Saudi Arabia about what Islam means, now want to kill the Saudis. And they identify Saudi regime as one of their major opponents. In fact, counterterrorism is, I think, one of the major reasons why we need to sustain our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Intelligence sharing is an important part of that. The Saudis, we know -- right, we know that because of cooperation with the Saudis, there have been plots foiled. In 2010, a plot by al-Qaeda to ship explosives from Yemen to the United States in airplanes was foiled because of cooperation with Saudi Arabia. In 2015, because of cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the United States, and cooperating with Lebanese authorities, was able to arrest the mastermind behind the Khobar Towers bombing that killed Americans, Saudis, and others in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia back in 1996. So intelligence cooperation is part of this. But also an extremely important part of this cooperation with Saudi Arabia and sustaining that relationship with Saudi Arabia is not simply the intelligence sharing, it's also that we need the Saudis on the ideological front against ISIS and al-Qaeda. We, the United States, have no standing in those arguments in the Muslim world, right? We can say, this is bad, this is wrong. No one in the Muslim world listens to us. We're not a Muslim country. What the Saudis do, right, as difficult as it is for us good liberal Americans, who really excoriate the Saudis on all sorts of grounds about women's rights and political freedoms for very good reasons. What we cannot do is make the argument against al-Qaeda and ISIS within their own intellectual framework, and the Saudis can do that. And that's another reason, besides the kind of very, very practical intelligence sharing that we do with them -- that's another reason the ideological fight against ISIS is best conducted from within the intellectual framework of Salafi Islam. And really, only the Saudis can conduct that fight. They are doing it. We have to press them to continue to do it, but I think that that makes them extremely important for the United States and argues for the sustaining of our relationship with Saudi Arabia.",1.0
for,"Thanks, John. Thanks, Intelligence Squared, for asking a good question, and thank you for coming. Professor Al-Rasheed and I are here to ask you to support the same position that we're arguing for, that a special, unconditional relationship with Saudi Arabia has outlived its utility. She's focused on some domestic and regional factors. I'm going to look at some more global ones and aspects of the bilateral relationship itself. First, United States does not need Saudi Arabia as much as it once did for oil. The relationship the United States had with Saudi Arabia began with oil, and it was premised from the 1973 oil embargo for a good while on access to oil. But due to technical -- technological advances like fracking, the United States doesn't need Saudi oil as much. There was a decline of some 50 percent of Saudi oil exports to the United States from April to December of 2014 as a result. The Saudis know they need to change. The deputy crown prince has put forward an economic reform plan called Vision 2030 based on moving away from that dependence on oil. They depend on oil for 77 percent of their budget. That's compared to merely 33 percent for Iran. The Saudi government needs to simultaneously find a new source of economic growth and convince the United States that the relationship is about something more than oil. Now, some say, including probably our debate partners, that the United States should care about this because the Europeans and the world economy depend on oil. But for a number of reasons, the United States can remain an important military guarantor of stability and access to oil in the region without having an utterly unconditional relationship with Saudi Arabia. The likelihood of overthrow of the regime is not great. Our counterparts here in the debate will probably argue that it's a fairly stable regime. And there isn't reason to think that there's going to be major war teen the regional powers or even a bad actor like Iran wanting to cut off the oil supply entirely. Second argument: Unconditional backing undercuts U.S. global credibility. This is a government, for instance, that stones, lashes, beheads people. It's executed over 150 people each of the last two years without due process. And internationally, the Saudis have engaged in harming civilians terribly in their escapades in Yemen, killing some 6,000 people in Yemen in the initial months of intervening to try and change the government to be more to its liking there. There are now some 3 million people displaced in Yemen. At the same time as the United States is rightly criticizing Russia for harming civilians in Aleppo in Syria, it stands by Saudi Arabia and is selling massive weapons, 10 percent of U.S. arms sales go to Saudi Arabia. The Wahhabist world view that Greg Gause talked about has indeed been a pernicious factor. It has -- as Hillary Clinton said in a memo quoted in WikiLeaks indicated, that donors in Saudi Arabia comes through the most significant source of funding, the Sunni terrorist groups worldwide. We've seen this impact in Southeast Asia and in western Africa villages. We've seen it in a $100 million going to extremist clerics in Pakistan from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with government support. We've seen it touching on Nigeria. We've seen it touching on Kosovo. Next argument. U.S. backing for Saudi Arabia leads to greater targeting of Americans. We help give birth to some of the worst extremists by working with Saudi Arabia to create jihadists to fight against the Soviets, perhaps in an elbow fight then, but they came to turn their eyes on the Saudi government and on the Americans from afar. It looks like even though there isn't a U.S. major deployment of troops anymore ever since Saddam Hussein was overthrown, that American presence is somewhat less in Saudi Arabia and still our association backing unconditionally that government of Saudi Arabia puts a bull’s-eye on the back of Americans because it's easier for extremists to fight Americans as the patrons of Saudi Arabia than to succeed in trying to overthrow the Saudi government right there. The Saudis engage in blackmail. If they really had the overlapping interests that our counterparts will argue that they had, they wouldn't regularly try to withhold intelligence sharing or threaten to stop buying our weapons or cooperating with us when, for instance, the Congress passes a law allowing American citizens with the families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi government. And that kind of leveraging happens with others. Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallström had the temerity to note women's rights are horrific in Sweden and she was punished with being barred from talking at the Arab League with visas being withdrawn from Swedes. This is blackmail. It's worth noting that also Saudi Arabia threatened the U.N. if it pointed a finger at it in its annual report on children in armed conflicts for the mayhem that it has been conducting against children in Yemen threatening to cut off aid, including for Palestinian refugees. Don't buy that this unconditional relationship has to stand as it is. Thank you.",1.0
against,"Thank you, John. Thank you all for coming. If there's one thing the recent presidential election showed is that it's a good thing to look at all of our assumptions and sunk cost ideas about foreign policy, domestic policy for that, and thus it's good to take a look at Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, this motion as written is not only and I quote the moderator, John, ""verbose."" It's also not very clear. If I were here tonight debating either we should stop defending South Korea or we should continue, I could give you an idea of exactly what that meant and some idea of the risks racking and stacking them. This is different because we're talking about a special relationship which has no real definition. As a diplomat I know what it feels like because I've done it in countries like Germany, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Korea, and a few other places that reached that level, but nonetheless, it is hard to pin down. But let me try to explain a little bit what a special relationship is and in particular what it isn't. Actually, I'll start with what it isn't. It isn't unconditional support. I don't know of a Saudi, and I've talked with most of the leaders, who would claim that Barak Obama gave Saudi Arabia unconditional support, but I would like to see the other side defend -- the point that he did. Nonetheless, a special relationship continued. We managed to maintain a good relationship with Saudi Arabia despite major disputes over Yemen, major disputes over Iran, because that's what special relationships do. They don't mean you agree on everything and they certainly don't mean you like each other's domestic policies. What they mean is that they're important players in a construct internationally that you share. So, that takes us to the key question, and it's a very dramatic question right now with a new administration with very new ideas, what is our national interest. From then we can deduce whether Saudi Arabia fits into them. The Trump administration is going back and forth with a lot of rhetoric and lightning bolts between a somewhat more colorful version of what we've been doing since 1945, which is a global security -- collective security system and a global order. On the other hand, some in the administration are pushing for a more muscular ""America First"" national interests approach, rather similar to what we saw -- and it didn't work well -- in the 19th century. But regardless of which way this administration goes, short of full isolationism, you're going to need friends and allies. We can't do whatever we want to do in the world alone. And that means we have to turn to countries that will help us. So, how does Saudi Arabia help us? Now, our colleagues gave us a wonderful example of how they helped us 20, 30 years ago. My first point is, they were certainly no more democratic or lovable then than they are now. In fact, on Mark’s scale, they would have been an 8, probably, 30 years ago -- -- if we'd had an 8. But nonetheless, we managed to do a lot of very important things with them. We've got big business to do with them now. First, oil. Back when all this started, according to the other side, it was all about oil dependency, except back in the 1970s, we were in America only beginning to important major amounts of oil. The problem was not oil to America then, or for a while, and we did import a lot -- including from Saudi Arabia -- now, when we only import about 25 percent, and only a small part of that from Saudi Arabia. It's about oil to the world. And where does that come from? 25 percent of internationally traded oil comes from the region around Saudi Arabia, and it is the biggest swing producer. That means that Saudi decisions on oil have a huge impact on the international economy that we trade with and have a huge impact on the price of gasoline at your pump. We saw what happens when we get on the wrong side of Saudi Arabia on oil issues in 1974. That's a good example that close friends don't always support each other. The next things is, the threats we're facing in the region. It isn't quite the Cold War, I grant you, but between ISIS and Iran, we have really terrible problems. Have the Saudis killed inadvertently, to a large degree, 6,000 people in Yemen? I think that's a pretty accurate figure. The side they're struggling against, Iran and friends, have killed deliberately, as a policy, a hundred times that. Those are the kind of facts we have to deal with. It isn't a choice between who you'll take to the ball. You're not looking for a special partner, a special relationship -- someone -- a significant other for the rest of your life. This isn't a love affair. It's a question of transactional issues to accomplish common goals. Those common goals include fighting ISIS, fighting Al-Qaeda, and containing Iran in the area. And there, we need the Saudis. My opponents are absolutely right about the blackmail. But I'm here to tell you, I don't know of a major ally of ours who hasn't done similar blackmailing. And had I six more minutes, I would start with Turkey. Actually, I would probably end with Turkey. But I could throw in even the lovable Germans and some others that would surprise you. The Japanese and the Koreans, once. So -- and as far as us being more in danger because of Saudi -- as a guy who's had a bulls-eye on my back, literally, in the Middle East repeatedly, it's never been because of our relationship with Saudi Arabia. It's been from many other things. That's not the fault of the Saudis. Thank you very much. Vote against this bad, bad motion.",1.0
for,"Saudi Arabia is a pressure cooker. And the more there is of oppression and sabotaging people's rights, the pressure is going to rise. And one day, it's going to implode from within. I just want to remind you of what Woodrow Wilson said about repression actually is so connected to revolution. And the U.S., by giving Saudi Arabia unconditional support, is actually sowing the seeds of revolution. It is unconditional. To give you two examples, if oil is important, those of us who are old enough, remember what happened in 1973 when the oil prices quadrupled-- or most-- because of the embargo. And with the U.S. support to Saudi Arabia it wasn't able to do anything, and it took six months for the oil prices to sort of stabilize, but at a very high price. The second point about this unconditional support is Yemen. We have --",2.0

It's not about to blow up. And it's a relationship that can withstand the United States pushing them a little more as opposed to giving them a free ride. But my colleague is right, they are resilient. And if they do not open up to women being involved, other forms of Muslims than Sunnis having a voice, it is going to be a pressure cooker that in the long run cannot last. Well, everybody thought Mubarak of Egypt was very resilient, and he lasted 35 years. It doesn't mean that things don't just sort of implode one day. And our failure as social scientists is we can't really predict with accuracy when these implosions are going to take place. But this doesn't mean that we can say that Saudi Arabia is stable and so many people have forecasted its downfall. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the U.S.-Saudi relationship. And it is an unconditional relationship so far as we can see.",2.0
against,"John, Mark and Madawi are right, and I think that Greg reinforced that. But I'll say it too. You can't tell who's going to blow up or who can't. But so far you can look at experience. In the Arab world since 2011, we've had three really big meltdowns with war; Yemen, Syria, and Libya. Those aren't American allies. Those aren’t people who were pushed to melt down because America either did too much or didn't do enough. The countries that have survived it include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, albeit with considerable turmoil, and Iraq. Those are countries that America has maintained, at times holding its nose, a close relationship. I'll rest my case.",2.0
for,"Yeah. I think, you know, the example that comes to my mind is Yemen. Saudi Arabia, for the last two years almost have launched air strikes on Yemen under different guises and argued that they are doing this in order to restore the Yemeni regime in Yemen. But what had happened was all this is happening with the approval of the U.S. So the U.S. is helping Saudi Arabia to fight a war with its rival in the Middle East, using American weapons that it purchased from the U.S., and destroy a country in its -- on its southern border. So I don't understand how we could describe this relationship in other terms apart from being unconditional. The U.S. is supporting Saudi Arabia in destroying an Arab country. It supported Saudi Arabia in moving its troop to Bahrain where a pro-democracy movement was actually gathering momentum. And the interesting thing is that the U.S. -- the United States Navy is stationed in this small island. Saudi Arabia moved its troop to support a regime that oppresses its own people.

Leaving aside why the Saudis are in Yemen and the level of our support, because I would say under the Obama administration -- I won't say I know -- it was cut back to an absolute minimum. But leaving that aside, can friends tell us how many significant countries, other than total pariahs, have had weapons cut off by the international community in the last 30, 40 years? I can't think of too many so I don't think that the argument that if the Americans didn't give them nobody would give them weapons.",2.0
for,"Well, we would say it is fair to call this an unconditional relationship. The United States regularly under law passed by Congress finds Saudi Arabia to be in the cellar in terms of religious persecution, human trafficking. It doesn't use the sanctions that the United States can because it waives it. It is a false dichotomy to say we have to have the relationship as it has been for decades or it's a divorce. It's -- the burden of proof is on us to say what a conditional relationship would be. I'll tell you. We should tie our arms sales to asking specific things of the Saudis. For instance, audit all those finances of your charities and your private organizations and individuals that have been funding education around the world that has been creating radical extremists. And secondly, if you say that you need to jack up your economy and not rely so much on oil, you need women in that economy. You need to change your male guardianship laws or else you're going to continue to have gender apartheid. Ask for those things and tie arms sales to them. That is a conditional relationship.",2.0

But the question is how receptive are not just governments but domestic public opinion to outsiders coming in and telling them how to rearrange their domestic social affairs, even with the best intentions and then saying and if you don't do that we're going to withhold X, Y, or I actually think that's counter-productive.",2.0

This idea that our foreign policy is all about interfering in the internal affairs of very, very different societies that the best of us know very little about, for our purposes -- to make them look more like us -- is a mistake, as a guy who has been sent out there for decades to do it.

I'm glad that Saudi Arabia and the deputy crown prince think that they need to change the economy and move off oil and reform things. But the proof of the pudding is in the tasting. We'll see if any more change happens than previous reform plans we've heard of. I think we tend to exaggerate the kind of reforms that we are witnessing in Saudi Arabia. Since the Arab uprising, hundreds of people went to jail -- bloggers, poets, historians, professors at universities. You can go to jail in Saudi Arabia if you write a poem about the king, criticizing his policies. You could go to jail if you Tweet 140 words. You can go to jail if you write a short article saying that perhaps there is a rivalry between the princes. You go to jail. So, basically, the -- let me just consider the issue of women. Mark mentioned the elections. We – don’t imagine that Saudis, men and women, are actually participants in elections. There are no elections in Saudi Arabia that bring an elected government. This is an absolute monarchy. What we have is a consultative council. Members -- the members are appointed by the king, and he appointed 30 women to this council. And its role is advisory. But appointing women to this council does not necessarily translate into empowering women. These are the king's women. They are not the women who represent the real women.

Even the Vision 2030, that is supposed to transform Saudi Arabia into this liberal market economy away from oil is very myopic.",2.0
against,"Look, I don't disagree at all with Mark and Madawi about the nature of, ""political reform"" in Saudi Arabia. There really isn't much. Women now have the right to vote for meaningless municipal councils the way men vote for meaningless municipal councils. But our argument is not based upon the fact, oh, the Saudis are improving domestically. I think Madawi's absolutely right that since the Arab Spring what had been a very interesting if very brief and very limited opening in terms of political discourse and public space in Saudi Arabia that we saw in the 2000s, after the 9/11 attacks, has basically shut down. I think she's absolutely right about that. So I don't premise my argument on the idea that there's political reform in Saudi Arabia. I do premise my argument on the premise that -- and I've doubled the premise. We’ll just go for three here now. -- on the idea that if the United States makes domestic change in Saudi Arabia the very top of its agenda the way Mark has advocated, I actually think that that would push back the possibilities of whatever change there might be in Saudi Arabia because people don't like outsiders to tell them what to do.",2.0
for,"Yeah, it's not a zero sum game. The U.S. can have good relations based on interests -- we're not talking about values -- with many countries in the Middle East at -- in the Persian Gulf, and it had actually started doing that. Stopping this unconditional support to Saudi Arabia doesn't mean that the U.S. shifts to Iran. The U.S. had other choices, for example, recently it had worked with Oman, another country in the Persian Gulf, to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear program. So there is diversification. But to put all your eggs in one basket and give Saudi Arabia this unconditional support is counterproductive. It's actually -- I'm not arguing that, you know, the U.S. should intervene in Saudi Arabia to change the situation in favor of Saudis. Saudis have asked for reform and have paid a high price. Change is not going to come from the U.S. And the U.S. specifically has a very bad record at instigating political change in countries in a successful way. We have examples. And --",2.0

I think Madawi is absolutely right that it's a mistake for the United States to say, we have to pick sides in the Middle East. I think we should try to have good, regular relationships with every major country in the Middle East, which is why I thought the nuclear agreement was a good idea. But that does not mean that Iran doesn't have regional ambitions. And I think that if you're looking at a Middle East that is in flames, where there are no really stable governments from the Iranian border to the Mediterranean, it would be a mistake for us to distance ourselves from Saudi Arabia at a time when Iran, frankly, is winning the regional balance of power game.",2.0

In terms of human rights for women, Saudi Arabia is at the bottom of the barrel. On other questions of human rights it ain't good. We have Mark's scale. But in a lot of areas, it probably crawls up to the number four and number five in certain areas of openness of speech, although that's also limited. I disagree with you, partially because I've looked at a lot of other countries where it's a lot worse. And the question is, is that the purpose of a special relationship, to make countries -- now, this is a question to the audience, and specifically to you. Is it your belief that we are out there with all of our guns and all of our military and all of our importance -- power in the world to make these people follow our norms? I don't think so.",2.0

If they really shared our interests, would they do more to make sure that funding from private charities and individuals did not go to extremist development of madrassa's that become a place for radicalization? If they really shared our values, our interests, then wouldn't they do those things?",2.0

Of course they could, but if you look at U.S. Treasury Department officials both in the Bush administration and in the Obama administration have said that they find Saudi cooperation on cracking down on money laundering, on private contributions to jihadist radical organizations to be vastly improved and very good. You can look at all sorts of statements by U.S. officials on that. Is there still money coming from the Gulf states? Not just Saudi. The Gulf states to private sources? Yeah. The Syria conflict inflamed public opinion in many of these areas and yeah, the money did go. But I tell you -- I'll tell you what Saudis have told me, right? Back in the '90s, the -- especially in the '80s during the Afghan jihad and then the '90s, anybody could go into Saudi Arabia and raise money for any cause. Now that has ended. It is very, very tight as to who can go in and raise money. That does not help their human rights record, right? This is not about freedom. If you want them to crack down on people who are giving money to groups you don't like, you're going to have to give them some room on these human rights questions because that crackdown is part of restricting people's freedoms. Yeah. I -- It's a good question, particularly the way John reformulated it. First of all, I may be violating John's rules. All in all, Mark has a point. If countries did look more like -- if not us, Denmark -- we would have a more stable world. The distance between us that has come into this is I don't know how to make that happen. And one reason for that is there is an international community that is up there in the U.N. It's in NGOs and such. And then there's the international community that I've dealt with for 35 years. That international community worries about the real security threats. Saudi Arabia, other than on the margins 20, 30 years ago with the Wahhabi outreach, was not on anybody's list. But it's a long list. And the main 911 to deal with that list has been -- ever since the 1940s -- the United States. We may like it--we may not like it. But that's what we've been doing all of that time. And what countries are motivated by is whether we stand by our allies. I myself didn't know if we did the right thing, abandoning Mubarak, from the standpoint of he was a total loser by the time he left, and it was clear he was going down. But what happened around the world was we got a hell of a lot more reaction and blowback around the world for letting a good ally go who put two divisions into Saudi Arabia in 1990 to stand with us against Saddam -- than we have ever gotten for our human rights cozying up with somebody who is violating them. That's the way the world works --",2.0
for,"The United -- The United States won't be able to -- and maybe shouldn't try to change the internal affairs of other countries overnight. But it would be a more stable and prosperous world if there was movement in that direction. I'll tell you one way we won't get there faster -- is to continue to have the relationship that we have now, which is largely unconditional. Barack Obama had misgivings. He said it was complicated, as you quoted it. But we sold $116 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia in the eight years that he was president. He had troubles with this regime, but the moment King Abdullah died, he made sure he went to that funeral and he gave the most unbelievable, over-the-top send-off for the dead king. We have an unconditional relationship. That's not going to get you more slowly in the direction of reform. I think the words ""leave us"" is not on the agenda of this debate. It is about changing what is called a special relationship, the unconditional relationship, into something that is more complicated. It is not a straightforward either-or situation. We are not asking the U.S. to intervene in Saudi Arabia's domestic affairs. But we are asking the U.S. to put conditions on the arms sales that kill people in neighboring countries -- in Yemen, for example -- or allow Saudi Arabia to become hawkish. We talked about Mubarak. And this is something that Jim mentioned, that the U.S. cannot just jump and save countries because it doesn't work. In 1979, the major ally of the U.S., the shah of Iran fell under the pressure of a mass revolution, and the U.S. couldn't do anything despite the fact that the U.S. had a close connection with intelligence services of Iran, with the -- with the Iranian government. And the same thing will happen in Saudi Arabia. If there is a problem, the U.S. cannot, and perhaps will not be able to save the regime. So it is time to switch that relationship from an unconditional support to the regime to a support of the Saudi people who are actually going to be there after the regime disappears. And the relationship will become stronger if the U.S. distances itself from the excesses of the Saudi regime. Right. I think we need conditionality and to actually forward some requests.",2.0

for,"Thanks for listening to our case. Professor Al-Rasheed and I will end on some more personal notes. Like Jim Jeffrey, I served as a diplomat at the State Department. In late 2008, I visited Saudi Arabia as the ambassador at large to combat human trafficking for the United States. There's a large problem of human trafficking in Saudi Arabia. Of the 27 or 28 million people who live there, a good 10 million of them are foreigners who are working as migrant workers or as domestic workers or in other forms. Of all the countries I visited as the U.S. envoy to combat human trafficking, in Latin America, Europe, Eurasia, multiple regions of Africa and all over Asia, in no capital did I feel that I was received with more of a distinct air of dismissiveness than in Riyadh. And that includes all of the autocratic allies of the United States of the Gulf. Why? Because on the human trafficking report, Saudi Arabia was in the lowest category. And on religious freedom, a country of particular concern subject to U.S. sanctions. But we waived them. Why was the Saudi regime so unconcerned about dialogue? Not as a human rights question, but because the special relationship is largely unconditional. We argue the United States doesn't need Saudi Arabia as much as it once did, especially for oil. That an unquestioning association with Saudi Arabia, given its executions, its gender apartheid, it's harm to civilians and its actions in Yemen, hurts U.S. standing and interests. And we would argue that the regime and the relationship are sturdy enough that it can withstand some conditions and some demands. Please support the position of the resolved idea that the U.S. special relationship has outlived its usefulness in its present form. Short of a divorce, unquestioning alignment with Saudi Arabia needs to end.",3.0
against,"Our friends on the other side want to eat their cake and have it too. They would have you think that the United States would not lose anything in terms of the values -- the value -- the foreign policy values that it gets from its relationship with Saudi Arabia by putting domestic Saudi issues at the forefront of the relationship. I think that this audience is too smart to buy that. You know that if something -- if you change something people are going to want to change how they deal with you. The Middle East is in flames right now. Weak and failed states are at the root of that crisis from Libya to Syria to Iraq to Yemen. I think it would be the height of folly to put at risk a relationship that has endured for decades and been valuable for the United States, the height of folly to put that relationship at risk when that country, Saudi Arabia, is itself pretty stable and has influence in the various conflicts occurring in the region. I think it would be a profound mistake for us to experiment with this relationship at a time when so many parts of the Middle East are unstable, convulsed in wars, civil wars, where regional war is a possibility. I think it would be a grave mistake for us to begin an experiment with a country that has had a very productive relationship with the United States. So I ask you to vote no on this motion. Thank you.",3.0
for,"I go back to my original statement that this U.S.-Saudi relationship has outlived its usefulness and when talking about the domestic affairs I brought them up so that you are aware that suppressing the Saudi people is counterproductive and it is going to implode if not today, in the future. My colleague, Professor Gause, wrote on the back of one of my books and I quote ""No one writing in English followed the Saudi political scene more closely and more critically than she does."" He knows that he and I cannot be sitting in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, debating this. And this is the problem. By oppressing Saudi people, by the depression that is so prevalent in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia loses the brightest people who are actually the future of the country. Like today there are a hundred thousand or even more than that, slightly more than that, Saudi students studying in the U.S. If those people utter a word of criticism of the Saudi government they sabotage their scholarship and also they can get their passports confiscated or even their nationality withdrawn. Those people are going to seek asylum nowhere but in this country and if we, all our -- the Saudis who have been educated leave the country were again to leave in the space a vacuum that is going to be filled by people exactly the same people who perpetrated that horrible act on 9/11. So there will be a vacuum created and this vacuum is going to hit not only Saudi people, but the U.S. I just want to conclude by giving you one personal story and allow me to share it with you. I was in the process of publishing a book called, ""A History of Saudi Arabia,"" and the Saudi -- their efficient intelligence services found out that I was writing this book in London. So they called my father. As a woman they don't want to talk to me so they have to go to my father to warn me. So, the Saudi ambassador in Paris calls my father and said to him, ""If your daughter publishes that book -- -- we are going to take disciplinary action."" Okay.",3.0

But I want to talk about a third visit of American officials to Riyadh in the summer of 1990. Saddam had gobbled up Kuwait in two days, and everybody was worried that the whole Middle East would blow up. The Saudis were horrified and frightened of Saddam. They were also frightened about American possibly deploying troops, leading to upheaval in the Kingdom. The American delegation came out and said, ""We'll stand by you, but you have to stand by us. We have to go all the way if we have to. This isn't just defending Saudi Arabia, although we'll do that. This is going into Kuwait and throwing them out if we can't get them out diplomatically."" The Saudis thought long and hard, and they said yes. For 12 years, good things flowed in that region from that one decision: the defeat of Saddam, the liberation of Kuwait, a Kurdistan in Northern Iraq that is one of the real success stories of the Middle East, the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians, the peace between Jordan and Israel, and many other things as well. That's what the Saudis are there for. This president -- or the next one -- is going to get one of those famous calls at 3:00 in the morning. And it probably will be involving the Middle East. He or she is immediately going to think, ""Where is Saudi Arabia?"" My argument tonight is we need that country. That country needs us. If we tamper with that relationship, for whatever superficial or secondary reason, they may not be there the way we need them, at a very, very dangerous moment for both them and for us. Thank you very much. Please vote against this.",3.0

So, what I'm saying is that – -- there are many Saudis, women and men like me, who would like to see a better future. And they get disillusioned when the U.S. supports this repressive regime. We're not saying that -- it is those people that we lose because of this double-standard that applies in its relationship to Saudi Arabia. Then U.S. interests will be affected, simply because the people who have the prospect for change, who want to change in positive ways, would leave the country. And we've already seen so many Saudis, on scholarship in the U.S., asking for asylum in order to stay here. If all of those people don't go back, then there is no future.
