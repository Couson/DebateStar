for,"Thank you all for coming, and thank you to the National Constitution Center for hosting the debate. The president does have the power -- the constitutional power -- to target American citizens overseas in the exercise of his war-making power. Now, that war-making power is not unfettered. The Founding Fathers saw to it that only Congress may declare war. Now, while formal declarations of war have not occurred since World War II, major military operations, such as the Gulf War, the 2001 Afghan War, and 2003 in Iraq -- all only happened after the executive was authorized to use military force by large bipartisan majorities of both houses of Congress. Now, the AUMF -- the authorization to use military force -- in 2001, which is the basis for President Obama's continued use of his war-making power against Al-Qaeda and associated forces -- our opponents will say, was only directed at those that participated in or planned 9/11. However, since that time, the judiciary, in the line of habeas cases from Guantanamo, has determined that the scope of that authority actually is Al-Qaeda and associated forces. The thinking behind this is that when you're dealing with an enemy like Al-Qaeda, that is diffuse, that is splintered, you are not going to require the president to return to Congress for authorization every time a new group with a new name shows up in a new location -- as long as they are still trying to kill Americans in this country or kill American troops and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Further, since that judicial gloss has been placed upon the scope of the authorization, Congress -- the Senate Armed Services Committee -- held hearings last year on whether the AUMF should be revised, repealed, or retained. And at the conclusion of those hearings, they left it as it was and so, at least implicitly, have accepted the scope of the authorization that the judiciary has put on this. Now, once the executive has received the authorization to use military force from Congress, it is then the exclusive province of the executive branch to determine when, where, and how that war is fought. Congress tells him who we are declaring war on. We declare a war on Germany, he can't go fight France. But it is up to him how he fights Germany, where he fights Germany, who he targets. That is exclusive executive decision-making. And no other branch has any constitutional basis for challenging that decision-making. And this is true, even when we are talking about targeting Americans. During World War II, the United States Armed Forces killed a number of American citizens that were members of the German and Japanese armies. But in today's war, we are being told that although those people -- the Germans and Japanese that we killed without questioning whether we were invading or infringing upon their due process rights. We're told that today, because our enemy doesn't wear uniforms, doesn't carry arms openly, hides amongst the civilian population and uses human shields, in other words, because they undermine all of the basic tenets of the laws of war, that they should be afforded due process rights that an American putting on a German uniformdoes not have. Now, the president does have a duty, under international law, to distinguish between targetable individuals and civilians. But he does not have a duty under either international law or the U.S. Constitution to distinguish between targetable Americans and targetable non-Americans. And as my partner will argue, such a distinction would be immoral. Now, you will hear our opponents argue that this authority of the executive is geographically bounded by “hot battlefields.” You can only use this authority in “hot battlefields.” That is a term that does not appear anywhere in either international law or in the U.S. Constitution. And yet because internal armed conflicts have been determined to exist based upon a level of violence measure, by some commentators in some courts, they are trying to impose that view of international law on our president. However, the U.S. view of international law is consistent with that of many other nations that face non-state actors that have committed terrorist acts against their citizens and then tried to seek sanctuary by crossing some international boundary. And just as Columbia and Turkey and Israel and even Iran reject the notion that you may gain such sanctuary, the United States also agrees that the laws of armed conflict go where the participants in the armed conflict go. And because this is an armed conflict, there are no due process rights available. Lastly, we are going to hear from our opponents that there is insufficient transparency on the part of the administration. They are not telling us enough about how they know what they know about our enemies and what they know about our enemies and why they are targeting our enemies. Now, of course, if they reveal this to the American public, they are also revealing it to our enemies. And to say that the due process rights of our enemies must be vindicated by telling our enemies what we know about them and how we know it does not -- well, let me say that it is obvious why there is no constitutional requirement for such disclosures. Thank you.",nan
against,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Today the president is claiming an absolute power that would have horrified the Founding Fathers. He asserts the authority to kill American citizens without judicial review based on largely secret law, entirely secret evidence, and he asserts this power even with respect to Americans who are found far from any conventional battlefield. Noah and I are here to argue against the proposition, because the power that the president is claiming is unlawful and it is unwise. In our system of checks and balances, the president cannot be the judge, jury and executioner. Now, for very good reason, our Constitution and international law strictly limits the government's power to kill people without judicial review. In areas of actual armed conflict, under the law, the government can kill people without judicial review because of battlefield requirements. Outside that context, extra judicial killing is legal only if it is a last resort and only if its in response to a truly imminent threat. The government can't kill Americans simply because it believes that they may do something dangerous at some point far off in the future. This is a democracy. It's not Minority Report. So in every context, the Constitution, outside of armed conflict, the Constitution requires the government to prove its case to a court before it delivers a death sentence. That's because even the most serious allegations are not evidence. And due process requires evidence, not just allegations. Now, the president, and our opposition, seek to circumvent due process in ways that strike at the heart of our system of checks and balances of what it means to be a nation ruled by law, not men or women. First they want to redefine the battlefield so that it covers the globe. That's not just wrong. It's a very dangerous proposition. And Noah's going to address that more. Then they want to redefine the law. We only found out after the leak of a so-called white paper which purports to summarize still-secret legal memos that were written to justify the killing of a U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki. The white paper acknowledged that he wasgoing to be killed outside of recognized battlefields, but argued that the killing could be lawful in response to an imminent threat. It then redefined imminence to mean its very opposite. The White House now says that it can order the killing of an American it suspects may some day present a threat even without evidence of an actual plot. This is a radical reinterpretation of the law. What should trouble us as much as these legal shenanigans is that the actual full standards for killing Americans far from any battlefield are still secret. The government refuses to disclose to us its killing memos. Was Anwar al-Awlaki truly an imminent threat? The only way to find out would be for President Obama's Justice Department to present its evidence to a court. This the government refuses to do. Instead, the Justice Department has made a profoundly disturbing argument and claim. It said that the courts have no role to play in deciding whether al-Awlaki's killing, far from a battlefield, was lawful. Now, you may hear a lot tonight from the other side about why we need to trust the government when it comes to national security and threats. But one of the core lessons of the last decade is that ""trust us"" is never enough when the government claims power over life and liberty. Do you remember when the Bush administration claimed that the people at Guantanamo were all terrorists, the worst of the worst? Remember when President Bush's Justice Department fought for years to prevent any judicial review of those claims ultimately without success? And do you remember what happened next? As the courts finally started reviewing the Bush administration's claims, it turned out that more often than not, the evidence that the government relied on was overstated, it didn't exist, or it was just plain wrong. The result was that the Bush administration itself released the majority of people at Guantanamo. When a president wrongly detains people, there's always the possibility of judicial review and release. There is no appeal from a drone strike. Many Americans were outraged when President Obama claimed worldwide authority to detain people, suspected terrorists, without charge or trial. We should be similarly outraged when President Obama claims something far more radical: The power, worldwide, to kill people the government unilaterally deems its enemies. Now, our concern here tonight isn't just for citizens. Four Americans have been killed in the targeted killing program. But thousands more non-citizens are dead. Several hundreds of these were far from any battlefield. They include a grandmother, for example, who was picking vegetables in her garden. And there are many more horrific accounts of similar tragedies and wrongful deaths. It isn't surprising then thatmilitary leaders warn that President Obama's lethal program is creating more enemies than it kills. Unlawful killings will never lead to security no matter how many of them our government commits. Think about the world we're creating. If the U.S. can carry out targeted killings in Yemen and Pakistan, why can't the Russians, the Chinese and Iranians do the same, Russia in Kiev, London or Washington, D.C.? This is not the world that we want to live in. And Noah and I hope you agree with us and vote no to the motion. It's a proposition that is un-American, unlawful and unwise. Thank you.",1.0
for,"Thank you. Under the precise motion before this house, our opponents have the extraordinarily heavy burden of showing that under no circumstances should the commander-in-chief ever have the authority to order the targeting of dangerous terrorists—regardless of how imminent the threat may be, how impossible it would be to capture him—if that enemy happens to have been born in the United States or naturalized as an American citizen. Consider the implications of that extreme position. It would mean that if Osama binLaden had been born in America, had been planning the attacks on 9/11, were targeted, it was impossible to arrest him, and the only way to stop him from carrying out 9/11 would be to subject him to a drone attack, under the negative of the resolution, the president would lack that authority. That just makes no sense at all. Of course what they're going to try to do now is try to modify their extreme position by saying that the president would be authorized under certain circumstances, they've already conceded in the battlefield if it's an American, they've already conceded apparently if the judiciary agrees, so they've already undercut their proposition considerably. But consider the implications even of their modified position. It would mean that unelected judges unfamiliar with the situation on the ground and inexpert at making intelligence assessment and operational decisions could prevent the commander-in-chief from taking action designed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks—even if such preventive action would be entirely lawful under both American and international law—if the people happen to have been American citizens. This is not Minority Report. These are cases where there is clear evidence that somebody in the past has joined al-Qaeda or its affiliates, has been an operational leader of al-Qaeda, and has participated in the planning of operations against the United States. That's not Minority Report. Our opponents argue that a terrorist commander planning an imminent attack on the United States that can only be prevented by a drone attack has a constitutional due process right to a judicial predetermination. But consider the following relevant analogy: what if an American citizen wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with his passport on one side and the American flag on the other took a series of hostages? You don't even have to imagine it. Just consider if Timothy McVeigh instead of killing so many children in Oklahoma City had taken them hostage, and let's assume that he had said, ""I'm not going to kill anybody for 48 hours until I complete the negotiation,"" but during that 48-hour period a sharpshooter was able to target him, not knowing exactly when he might start killing Americans. Would anybody in their right mind demand a due process prejudicial determination, or would you say that the situation there permits for the use of deadly force? That's not murder. Yes, it's an extrajudicial killing, but extrajudicial killings occur all the time. Every time a fleeing felon runs away with a machine gun from a bank robbery, even though the bank robbery's complete, just on the basis of the possibility they may do it again, the United States Supreme Court has definitively ruled that deadly force may be used without violating his due process rights and without a predetermined judicial authority. In fact, the Supreme Court, just two days ago, heard a case on that issue, andthe report in the New York Times said none of the justices gave any attention to the claim that it would be a due process violation in shooting a fleeing felon under those situations. Of course mistakes are made. There are -- mistakes are made with fleeing felons, and of course every effort should be made to reduce the number of casualties. Some of the people referred to by my distinguished opponent were accidentally killed, including the son. He wasn't targeted. When you drop bombs people are accidentally killed. It's especially the case when terrorists make the decision to hide among civilians. They make the decision to violate the rules of law, the rules of warfare, and, as the result, the only option put to a democracy is to use the drone in the most targeted possible way, knowing that there might be some collateral damage and civilian casualties or allow the terrorists to continue. There should not be a distinction drawn between terrorists who are American citizens and terrorists who are not, except, of course, if they're captured, in which case being an American citizen makes it worse because it's treason. But if they're not captured, if they're on the battlefield, once one signs up to become an al-Qaeda operative, his or her citizenship does not and should not matter. The important distinction is not between Americans and non-Americans, but rather between combatants and civilians. All Al-Qaeda operatives are unlawful combatants. That is, they are subject to being targeted as combatants, because they've joined Al-Qaeda, because they are at war with the United States. But they are not entitled to the benefits of being legitimate combatants because they do not comply with the rules of warfare. So, just use your common sense and ask yourself the question -- does the Constitution really straight-jacket the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces? Does it really deny him the constitutional power to prevent an act of terrorism just because the person planning the act of terrorism is an American citizen? I urge you to vote that the president has such power to protect you and your children. Thank you.",1.0
against,"When I was a kid, I really liked to argue. And my parents told me that I should grow up and I should defend civil liberties, like Alan Dershowitz. I don't think they thought -- and I know I didn't think -- that I would eventually have to defend civil liberties from Alan Dershowitz -- But that seems to be where we are. We're on hallowed ground here. Those of you who live in Philadelphia are accustomed to invocations of the Constitution and its importance. But for those of us who are visitors, it's not a trivial thing to come from the airport, get out of the taxi, and see Independence Hall, where the most basic principles of liberty were set down for the United States. And indeed, the Framers believed, that by demonstration, they were setting down those principles of liberty for the whole world. That matters, and it ought to matter to us in thinking about this issue, because it pushes us to ask what's really the most fundamental question you could ask about the nature of liberty and democratic government: What is the essence of liberty? What's it all for? Why do we even have a constitution? And if you boil that down to its deepest essence, the most fundamental component of liberty, going back to Magna Carta, which is 1215 -- if you're counting. Not the time 12:15. The year 1215. The essence of Magna Carta -- the thing that was demanded from King John of England -- was to promise that the government would not kill its own citizens without a trial. That's it. That's the essence of liberty. Your government can't kill you without a trial. And when we say ""due process,"" which is a fancy expression, that's all it means. That means you get a chance to explain that you didn't do it, that it wasn't you. And before that happens, they won't kill you. Now, if you are fighting at the Battle of Guadalcanal in a Japanese uniform, and you suddenly hold in the air your U.S. passport, sure, there is no doubt that in that context, the American soldier on the other side can kill you, because you are on the battlefield in a legitimate war. And to think otherwise would be preposterous. And it is, to be completely blunt, a classic debaters' trick to say that somehow, we have a radical position or that we've modified our radical position for denying that. That's just common sense. And common sense should, I insist, drive your vote in this case -- though not exactly in the direction that our opponents think it oughtto. Now, what is the difference between a person on the battlefield fighting in a war and an American citizen, thousands of miles from home, who is targeted by a government program? The answer is pretty simple, and there are two of them. One is, under the international law of war and under our domestic law, the threat has to be imminent. As Hina explained, imminence is -- means what the word imminence sounds like it means. Imminent. About to happen. And if you read the white paper, what it says -- this government document -- it's nominally a description of an even more secret document -- it says ""Imminence is not imminence. Imminence is where you might have done something in the past and you're a member of Al-Qaeda, and maybe you're a senior member of al-Qaeda, and so you might do something in the future. That's not imminence under the law, and it's not imminence under common sense. The second element is, you have to be in the war. You have to be on the battlefield. Now, the other side has said, quite honestly -- and I give them a lot of credit for saying this -- that in their opinion, the battlefield is anywhere. Anywhere. So you get off the plane at Heathrow, some of you probably travel every so often. You're abroad, so you're under the terms of our motion. You can be killed. Why? Because the president of the United States could determine, secretly, by a secret process, that he believes that you are affiliated with either al-Qaeda or some other force that he says, now, 13 years after 9/11, is affiliated with al-Qaeda. We'll leave aside whether you could be affiliated with an affiliated group, but there's reason to think that even that would satisfy the administration. And when that happens, you can be killed. Now, is that consistent with the idea of a declaration of war? No, it is not, because a battlefield cannot stretch forever in time and everywhere in geographical dimension. That is not war under the meaning of our Constitution. It is not war as our Founding Fathers would have recognized it. It is not war even as Congress would have intended. And it is certainly not war under the meaning of international law as is shared by people around the world. That meaning, by the way, is relevant to our Constitution, because when our Constitution talks about the declaration of war, it's referring to a concept from international law. The word ""war"" means something in our Constitution. It gets its meaning from international law. As a consequence of all this, you have to have ask yourselves, where will it end? So there's a plausible answer, which is, eventually, Congress will say the war is over. When do you think that's going to happen? When do you think it's going to be in the politicalinterests of your elected representatives to stand up and say, you know, 9/11 happened. We fought back. The war against terror is over, and we hereby -- what, peace treaty? There's not going to be a peace treaty. So I think it's quite realistic to expect that from the standpoint of Congress, and therefore from the standpoint of the executive, they're never going to end this war. And the same goes for geographical range. They're never going to say they can't kill you. If that bothers you, you should vote no on the proposition.",1.0
for,"Well, in the old days, they used to actually have battlefields that were marked off. And the battles would occur on the battlefield. Obviously, over time, the concept of battlefield is expanded. Al-Qaeda expanded it even more by declaring that the battlefield was anywhere where they can legitimately operate from and kill Americans. There's no doubt that the battlefield includes Yemen. It includes the Sudan. It includes parts of Pakistan. Of course, it doesn't include Heathrow Airport because we can arrest people at Heathrow Airport. For purposes, functionally, of defining the powers as we discuss it, it includes anywhere where al-Qaeda is operating functionally, where it has the protection of local people, where they can't be arrested, and from where they can attack the United States. That is a reasonable, functional definition of battlefield, and we have to adapt the definition to our enemies, otherwise our enemies will defeat us through law fare, not through warfare.",2.0
against,"I'm reminded of something that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, which is that you're entitled to your own opinions, but you're not entitled to your own facts. Here in this situation, you're not really entitled to your own reinterpretations of the law and presenting it as the law currently is. Actually, the law is pretty clear. There are tests under international law about what a battlefield constitutes. It's called hostilities, and it is exactly what it sounds like, which you -- you've got to have a certain threshold of violence. You've got to have a certain threshold of repeated violence. That standard is quite simply not met by the one that our opponents offer up. They would have the battle field be wherever the government says that it is. And it's not where thegovernment says it is. It isn't where al-Qaeda says it is. It is where there actually are the kinds of hostilities happening on the ground. But you know, one thing I really want to pick up on and address back and ask our opponents, if I may, and that is -- well, one of the challenges is, professor Dershowitz was citing so many straw men, it's hard to know which one to take up with him. But I think one of the ones that I want to lay to rest is the idea that there is somehow a substantive difference in terms of the legal standards when we're talking about citizens and noncitizens. It isn't. The same legal standards apply to both. The difference is that there is no question that citizens are able to have their cases reviewed and to see if there was a Fifth Amendment due process violation. Unfortunately, since 9/11, the courts have reduced that possibility for noncitizens. But my question for you is, why do you think that it is impossible to have judicial review, at least after the fact when the Supreme Court of that other democracy that carries out targeted killing as state policy, Israel, has actually examined and made a determination about when and whether targeted killings are lawful, set out the standards that must be followed, and established a process for independent review, including judicial review. Why should the U.S. be different?",2.0

against,That's right.,2.0
for,"The motion that we are having argued is, does the president have the power to order the strike in the first place without prejudicial review. After the review, that's a different matter. You're right, Israel has that. We do have post-strike evaluation within the executive branch. If we want to expand that to the judicial branch, I would be in favor of that, but that doesn't change the fact that the motion should carry. The other thing that I want to say about your discussion of the boundaries of the battlefield, orwhat constitutes a battlefield, the threshold of violence discussion that she mentions is from the Tadicopinion from the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia). And that applies to internal armed conflicts, right? This is not dealing with a conflict between a nonstate actor that crosses international boundaries. That was from the Yugoslav war, right? If we are talking about the boundaries of battlefields between two nations, World War II did span the entire globe. Americans killed Japanese and Germans in the south Atlantic and in China and in Burma and off Australia. All over the world, those things were going on. And more importantly, if we're talking about what other nations do, other nations facing nonstate actors do not allow them to have a sanctuary, which is what they are saying they should get, by going across international boundary. You get to Yemen, you get to Somalia, you get to Sudan, and you're safe. You are immune from attack just because you got to a certain place, and then you can rearm, refit and reattack. The laws of war do not work that way.",2.0
against,"I just want to clearly refute the point that somehow the battlefield is anywhere where we can't arrest somebody. First of all, we could we could arrest the people in lots of these countries, Yemen and Pakistan included. And if you want proof of that, it's that those governments actually agreed to our drone strikes. The Obama administration's official position is we don't do drone strikes in a country without the permission of that country. You know why? Because otherwise it would be an act of war against that country. So we get permission, and we got permission in all of these cases. So if you can get permission from a country, you can get help from that country. And, in principle, arrests would be possible. Want to add one more point. If you think that anywhere in the world counts as the battlefield, then even though our motion talks about abroad, if you vote, ""Yes,"" on this motion, ""Yes, the president can do this abroad,"" it follows logically that the president could do it within the United States.",2.0

What we are trying to say -- if you're talking about wartime, there is no imminence. You are allowed to kill an enemy during wartime whether they are armed, whether they are awake, right? You are allowed to kill enemy -- positively identified enemy soldiers in wartime -- at any time, right? That doesn't require a showing of imminence. And the question is, are we at war with Al-Qaeda?

for,"But I don't think -- well, first of all, when you talk about -- it's not the executive that is saying we are at war. It is Congress that is saying we are at war, and it's their job so say so. And al-Qaeda and associated forces, who are they? In the operational sense, then you're talking about al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda -- So they are saying that if we are going to -- we cannot distribute in detail how we are determining who the enemy is because if we describe in detail who the enemy is, then they will make sure that they are not that, right? If you think about Rico laws, Rico laws are developed to deal with the mafia because the individuals in the mafia knew what they could say or not say, and therefore not be guilty or not be close enough to the crime. Same thing here. If we say, what you need to be to be on our list is you have to be doing A, B and C. At some level, you always have to trust the executive because it's the executive that is given the authority to do this. But also, every single act of targeted assassination is then reported to the House and Senate intelligence committee. There is review. And by the way, I'm not opposed to after the fact judicial review. Virtually every exercise of legitimate presidential power is subject to judicial review. There is no inconsistency between saying the president has the power, which is our proposition, and them saying, but if he violates that power or abuses it, you can take him to court under judicial review. We don't oppose that. What we oppose is having the judiciary or the Senate or House, that would be a bill of attainder, but the judiciary in advance saying, well, maybe this guy you can kill, this guy you can't kill, when the president and the intelligence community have information that they cannot disclose. And one more point that I have to make is that you're so solicitous about al-Qaeda members. About 600 Americans are killed every year by police in the course of arresting fleeing felons. We do that without judicial review. The Supreme Court in the case of Gardner vs. Tennessee has said if there is any possibility that the person is dangerous and might commit a crime in the future, if the alternative is to let him escape or not let him escape, you can shoot him dead. How do you distinguish that ?",2.0
against,"I just want to be really clear that what we're debating -- and this is an answer to that. What we're debating here is the president's power under the Constitution, what he's really authorized to do Constitutionally. The president is authorized. The police are authorized to use deadly force in a situation of true imminence. Absent imminence, the president is not authorized. And what we're talking about here in the real world, and we're talking about a real world case, is where there is no imminence in the ordinary sense of the term.",2.0

for,"No. Well, the question is -- -- imminence of what? Now, let me be very clear. Let me put on my hat as a law professor who has been teaching Tennessee vs. Gardner for the last 25 years. The law is completely clear that the person does not have to be imminently planning another crime. The imminent is he will escape unless he's shot dead. The only alternatives are shooting him dead or letting him escape. He's committed a past crime. He may commit a future crime. So the Supreme Court, for American citizens, has already defined imminence functionally. If this is your last opportunity to arrest him, and he will otherwise escape, you may shoot him dead. So Noah, you're just wrong when you say that the imminence requirement always modifies the imminence of the ultimate harm. Sometimes it modifies the imminence of the escape.",2.0
against,"Yes. That’s I think what I started off saying in the first two minutes of when I started talking, and I think that that is correct. What we're talking about here is the power that the president is claiming today that goes beyond what the Constitution and international law permits. No one seriously questions that the president has the power to order the killing of people, citizen and noncitizen alike, when they are on an actual battlefield. Those are the battlefield rules under certain constraints. No one's questioning that lethal force may be used in response to an imminent threat. And one point here, the thing about fleeing felons is they're felons. They've been found guilty --",2.0

It may be a movie. He may have wondered onto a movie set. But if he reasonably believes that there's been no trial, that's my point. So let me -- Thank you. So the answer is that we're not being absolute. We're talking about what is going on today and why that is impermissible, why that goes beyond the boundaries of anything permitted by law.",2.0

And I think one of the big disagreements we have here is where is a battlefield? And one thing that I heard them say earlier and that I want to come back to really quickly now is law enforcement. Let's have law enforcement in Pakistan, all right? Let's have law enforcement in the FATA region of Pakistan. There are no police in the FATA region of Pakistan. That is not how it's constructed. The Pakistani constitution does not apply in the FATA region of Pakistan. This is not how -- so you can't say, ""Well, Pakistan can enforce the law there.” No, it can't, right, under its constitution, the way this works is you have an agent from Islamabad that goes up and deals with local tribal disputes, and those are enforced by tribal militias. There are no police in FATA --John Donvan: And your point being? -- and there is no law enforcement in FATA. So for them to be saying that we should rely on law enforcement to capture people in the FATA region of Pakistan is ridiculous because it doesn't exist.",2.0
against,"I deeply appreciate Mr. Galeman-- is that your name -- Len Galeman:Yeah. -- Mr. Galeman 's question because I think it really captures the tremendous danger of the position that the other side is arguing for and that the administration has adopted. The United States is not at war with radical Islam or even with jihadi Islam as a matter of law or as a matter of policy, okay? That's not the state of play. Congress did not declare war on all Muslims. I think -- it did not declare war on all radical Muslims. It did not declare war on all jihadi Muslims. It declared war on al-Qaeda and forces who are fighting with al-Qaeda. Now, there is a natural human tendency, and I sometimes share it myself, to think, ""Look, one radical jihadi group is a lot like another. They're all kind of similar.” And, in fact, in the world of al-Qaeda, where there's no formal organizational method, you can just start your own jihadi organization, and you can call yourself ""al-Qaeda,"" and there's no one there to stop you. We've actually seen versions of this happening in Syria recently. On the view that the United States can indefinitely fight wars against anybody who dresses himself or herself up in the guise of al-Qaeda, there really will be no end to this. We will really be in a situation where wherever the president wants to kill someone, anywhere in the world, who happens not to like us very much, it will fall arguably within this same degree of authority. And that's what the problem is. I just want to close by saying -- to that point by saying that we are all busy people, and you didn't come here to listen to a debate about an abstract topic. We're debating a real topic in the real world, and that's what we're debating is what the actual government of the United States is actually doing and its real world policies. That's what's on the table.",2.0
for,"I think the answer to that is when they become an operational member of Al-Qaeda. An operational member means you are not just proselytizing, you are not just giving people religious reasons for liking Islam or hating America. You can say, ""I hate America"" all you want. But when you become an operational member, that means you are making bombs. You are planning attacks. You are carrying out attacks. You are conducting weapons training. You are training others. And you are directing them how to make suicide bets and conduct suicide attacks. How do you build a car bomb, how do you drive a car with 500 pounds of explosives in it effectively. You learn those things, you teach others those things, you are an operational member of Al-Qaeda. And so, this is not a surprise. You don't get off the plane at Heathrow Airport. ""Oh, I'm suddenly targetable.” No, you are doing these things. And it's not a surprise to either Anwar Al-Awlaki or Al-Shami -- who is designing IEDs in Pakistan -- IEDs are the biggest, most effective killers of American troops in Afghanistan. That is why he is possibly going to be targeted. It's not a surprise to him-- -- that that's going to happen.",2.0
against,"Sure. You know, American citizens always have the right to due process. The question is, what does due process look like in a particular circumstance? And when we're talking about an actual armed conflict, people on a battlefield, then due process does notrequire trial or charges if lethal force is going to be used. When we're talking about an American citizen who is posing an imminent threat, walking down the street waving a gun or some other kind of imminent threat situation -- then, no, due process does not require charge and trial, conviction before anything -- before a death penalty. Well, and -- but -- To these limited circumstances, right? But what we're talking about here is something that goes far beyond that, which is the claim that a person may be deprived of their due process rights, even when they are far from any battlefield, even when they do not pose an imminent threat, and that the government will not let -- or does not want to let the judiciary test that claim. That is, at heart, one of the most problematic things that is going on.",2.0

for,"Well, not only that. They have -- they have -- -- drones which actually see them doing it. It has to go through about six levels before a targeted assassination is authorized. It has to first go through the intelligence community. They have to have a report. The reason there have been leaks is the President of the United States has apparently refused to accept the recommendation of the killing of this person now who is on the possible hit list. He wants more evidence. He wants more review. He wants more process. Essentially, this administration -- I'm not here defending the administration -- has insisted on essentially an administrative warrant, essentially a multi-layered process. And they have been very, very cautious about when they've done it, how they've done it, and to whom they've done it. That's why there have only been four. When you compare that to how incautious we allow our police often to be in making on the spot decisions about whether to use lethal force against fleeing felons or against hostage-takers, you will see that we're much more cautious about our enemies who are trying to kill us than about American citizens in theUnited States -- we should not apply a higher standard -- a more difficult standard to people who have as their -- -- declared goal -- -- to kill as many Americans as possible.",2.0
against,"Sure. I really want to get at what the heart of this issue is, which is what the administration's policy and what is the legal interpretation standards that they are applying. Evidence -- they're keeping it entirely secret. Apart from naming four U.S. citizens who have been killed, they have not identified any other information on the record to a court where it can be subjected to independent review. That is the heart of due process. The administration's claim is that due process does not equal judicial process. And we could not disagree more. The one other things that I would add is that when you look at the White Paper, which is all we currently know are the standards that the administration is using, it uses the same cases that we have used to the courts, to argue for judicial process. It uses the same language of due process. It recognizes what is due, but then it radically reinterprets what the courts have said to fit a situation in which the legal constraints, important constraints that the law places to ensure that the people, the government --John Donvan: Okay. -- kills really are their -- Sure. Right now -- -- the battlefield exists in Afghanistan and potentially the border regions with Pakistan.",2.0

against,"When I started out earlier this evening, I laid out the ways in which both Constitution and international law work together in order for there to be authority to protect us as well as to protect individual liberties. We talked about the extent to which there is a right to use lethal force and how important it is that that right be constrained. And I remind you that our founders included the due process clause in the Bill of Rights at a time when the very life of the republic was at stake, when it was facing an existential threat. That's not the issue now. But even then, at that time, founders believed that there's some powers that a people should never concede to their government. That's why they included the due process clause, because they thought that extraordinary powers in one office inevitably will be abused no matter who sits behind that desk. That's especially true when we are faced with amorphous terms like ""global battlefield,"" ""associated forces,"" terms that can be subjected to misuse, abuse, regardless of how good the intent of the human being can be. The basic proposition before you today is that the president can carry out a targeted killing of a person, including American citizens, without due process, without ever presenting that evidence to a court. The executive has that power even with respect to a 16-year-old who is killed far from any battlefield. That is quite simply not the law. The president has gone beyond what the Constitution and international law permits him to do. We ask you to vote against the proposition in order to start reining back the kinds of powers that have been so dangerously assumed and asserted today.",3.0
for,"I think that our opponents have essentially conceded the motion. The president does have Constitutional power to target and kill U.S. citizens abroad they concede, if it's on the battlefield, if it's imminent, and they don't distinguish between Americans and non-Americans. That, it seems to me, essentially concedes the proposition and imposes some limitations on it. They throw out some red herrings like a 16-year-old. Nobody ever targeted a 16-year-old. That 16-year-old was tragically and accidentally killed the way 16-year-olds are tragically and accidentally killed on battlefields, and in all aspects of war and the way they're killed by terrorists.Look, I love the Constitution. I have devoted my life to defending civil liberties and the Constitution. I, too, was on the national board of the ACLU. I'm here today to defend civil liberties. The civil liberties of noncombatants, all noncombatants, whether Americans or non-Americans, I believe in a living Constitution which adapts to changing times. I fear that if the president's ability to defend us against terrorist attacks, even those committed by American citizens is placed within an unrealistic straight jacket, grave damage will be done to our Constitution and to the international laws of war that distinguish between civilians and combatants, not between Americans and others. The Constitution is a living document that permits every generation of Americans to strike the appropriate balance between protecting our civilians and living within the rule of law. We can do both. We can do both as long as we adapt to new realities such as the fact that terrorist groups operate all over the world and operate within civilian areas. We must adapt. Allowing the president to employ these drone strikes will strike that proper balance. So in the name of the Constitution, in the name of civil liberties and human rights and common sense, I urge you to vote yes.",3.0
against,"I really love debating. And this has been a really fun debate. And arguments have been terrific on all sides. But the stakes of your vote and the stakes of this debate are a little different than they would be for almost any other kind of debate that Intelligence Squared could put together. And I want so just say why that is. In the real world, the way that drone strikes are now used, is that an administration -- it could be Democratic or Republican -- leaks to the press that it plans to target and kill a particular American somewhere in the world. Last time it was Yemen, this time in process it's Pakistan. Now, that leaves that person a choice. And in the case of the Yemen example, that person through his father actually came to a U.S. court and said, ""Hey, I'd like to be heard. You got the wrong guy. I'm a propagandist. I don't like America very much. But I'm exercising my free speech rights."" And the executive branch said to the courts, ""Don't hear this case."" They used a bunch of reasons, but one of them was, ""It's a secret whether we're targeting him or not."" This was after they had leaked it. Then they killed him. And then they said, ""Well, you definitely don't get review after the fact,"" right? ""Oh, and, by the way, we did kill him,"" so it wasn't apparently that much of a secret after he was dead or when it was leaked in the first place. Now, we're in the midst of one of these processes right now. Now, we could speculate about why the government does it this way nowadays. One possibility is that they've got a bad conscience about whether this is really imminent under their own legal definition. But I'll tell you this, and I'm really not joking, when they're running something up the flagpole to see who salutes, they're trying to see how you, not ""you"" in the abstract, ""you, the particular people in this room"" will vote on this question. How you vote will be noticed. It will be a component of a real world process at the end of which someone will live or die. And on that basis I urge you to vote, ""No.""",3.0
