for,"If you need more time I’m afraid I can’t help you. I’d like to thank Bob Rosenkranz and Intelligence Squared. I feel like I’ve spent most of the past year watching Presidential debates, it’s nice to finally be in one. Please don’t change your minds, Bush was obviously the worst President of the past 50 years. Yet the task Simon and I have tonight is extremely difficult. We have to convince a small fraction of you, at least if you’re anything like the people who have given Bush the lowest approval rating of any post-war President, who still resist that conclusion. And to be honest I’m not sure that people who still defend the Bush Presidency are entirely open to persuasion. But I wanna try, by talking a little about how much Bush has done wrong and how little he’s done right. Let me first just tell you a little bit about my own perspective on this, I am not a Bush hater. I’m not someone who can be described as a partisan Democrat, the way Mr. Kristol and Mr. Rove are partisan Republicans. I’m a centrist liberal, I’m fairly hawkish on security issues, I’m in favor of limited government. And let me just state up front, I think George W. Bush was a fine governor of Texas. I think Ronald Reagan was a successful President, and I think George"
against,"And Pakistan? I loved it, being lectured about undermining the government of Pakistan. After all, haven't we just elected a President who promised to invade Pakistan if it didn't comply with America’s wishes? Now look, I will defend the President, and I will defend the record of the last eight years. Not always successful, but enormously successful over the long term and the long sweep of history. Karl Rove, thank you very much. Thank you for having me here tonight. Thank you, Karl Rove. And that concludes the opening statements. In a minute or two we’re going to come to you, the audience, again, reminding you to keep your questions focused and brief and have a question mark at the end of it. But we now have the numbers that tell us your opinions as you came off the street tonight. On our motion that George W. Bush is the worst president of the last fifty years, that Bush 43 is the worst president of the last fifty years, sixty-five percent of you are for the motion, seventeen percent against, and eighteen percent undecided. And again, as we said at the beginning, we tend to judge success in this debate by how much you can actually move those numbers. So, if that sixty-five percent goes up, the side for will have prevailed, if the seventeen percent that is against goes up, that side will be seen to have prevailed."
for,"Well I disagree with that. Every president until, through Bush’s father, had to manage the Cold War which was infinitely more threatening to the existence of civilization than September 11th was. And in particular, if you want a particularly specific example, John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis, which probably brought us closer to Armageddon than we’ve ever been. And the way Kennedy personally managed that crisis, if you’ve ever seen the movie Thirteen Days, or listened to any of the tapes, is an amazing story, because he rejected the advice of very powerful people in his administration who claimed to know a lot more than he did. But his instincts were very good, and he made the decision that saved us all. Audience questions. I'm going to collect a couple. To the right here, and then I want to get to the other side, I see a white sleeve halfway up, keep that hand waving and we’ll get a microphone to you."
against,"Yeah, well look, we’re asking, it’s an unpopular war, and we’re asking the country to do tough things for a long time. And the economy’s bad. I would remind you, not to correct Mr. Weisberg, but there have been three presidents who have had lower approval ratings that I'm aware of, Carter, well actually four, Carter, Nixon, Johnson, and Truman. Truman left office with numbers lower than this President’s. History has judged each of these men differently after their departure. If I could respond to the second one, rule of law. First of all, I'm not aware that I’ve refused to testify in a criminal investigation. You may know something I don’t know. You want to elucidate? I think what you may be suggesting is why will I not testify in front of the United States Congress? And the reason is because I believe in the rule of law. The rule of law that says there’s a separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches, and that the President of the United States has a right to receive confidential advice form his assistants, which has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Now, right now it’s being re-litigated again, because the United States Senate did not like the answer the White House gave them in the summer of July, in the summer of 2007. If I'm called upon, and a court of law says that the President has no such right, I’ll testify. In the House of Representatives and in the Senate, we have made numerous attempts to provide the Congress with the information that it’s requested, in a way that protects the right of a President and his prerogative to receive that kind of advice from his staff, from his confidential advisors. The Senate has refused to take any one of the options. The House refused to take five separate options that we gave them, until finally, some members of the House Judiciary Committee asked the questions that were being asked by the Committee, and sent them to me. And under penalty, I responded to those, and if you like, you can find my answers at Rove.com. So, I’ve answered them. But, there is a rule of law, and we ought to respect that rule of law that says there is a separation of powers between the branches, and that’s exactly why I’ve been directed by the President not to testify in front of Congress on these issues. Simon Jenkins, I want to bring you into the conversation. We, the issue, that question was premised on the notion that America’s image has always rested on its adherence to the rule of law, and that the years of the Bush administration have, to some degree, to seem to have been a disintegration of the value of the Constitution. With Barack Obama now taking over, does the fact that he has this terrible image with which to compare himself, give him a boost, or does the fact that American leadership have been so diminished, respect for America has been so diminished, give him a terrible starting point? Well, I think the origin of this whole part of the discussion is the response to 9/11. 9/11 is the starting point of almost everything that we’ve been talking about. And I think many people in Europe, and around the world, simply feel that America over-reacted, and so did Britain, I may say. So, this is not something peculiar to America. It was a feeling that some new force had been unleashed on the world to which we had to respond by restricting our normal customary defenses and liberty. I'm a libertarian, and I feel that was, I’ve always felt that was simply unnecessary, the reaction was an overreaction. The consequence of it, however, is that we have, in a sense, played the terrorist’s game. We’ve done what they wanted us to do, which was restrict our liberties, curb our liberties, behave in a certain way towards other States and other peoples that we would not normally have done before. And—"
for,Would that they were on the run.
against,"Well, they launched one series—"
for,…on Osama bin Laden—
against,One series of—
for,"They missed. Bush hasn’t got him either. They started a little later. Anyway… Bush turned that around. But I just don’t buy this premise that we’ve radically curved civil liberties. Bush has done less after the 9/11 attack than any other President has done, much, much less, he’s much more responsible than Franklin Roosevelt was after we were attacked in World War II. He’s been much more solicitous of civil liberties than, if I might say, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were during, and Richard Nixon were, during Vietnam. We’ve had, you know, some controversial calls, and some tough calls. There were a couple of over-reactions which the Bush administration itself walked back, Jack Goldsmith and Attorney General Mukasey have, I think, corrected some controversial interpretations that probably went too far— Bill, can I interrupt you—"
against,Yeah.
for,One second—
against,That's not true.
for,He was not—
against,"They, he changed the actual Office of Legal Counsel policy, and Attorney General Mukasey is leaving the Bush legal program intact, and I— But if you— It’s totally defensible, and it will not be changed much by Barack Obama."
for,"If you read Goldsmith’s book he was driven out, more or less. But the point is you--I'm amazed by--I appreciate how open minded you are about some of these issues. But on the civil liberties issues, you're amazingly cavalier. Closing Guantanamo is no big deal, we have them here, we have them there. Torture, you won't second guess the decisions. I mean, these go to the heart of the questions about the rule of law and the Constitution, and the question of whether terror suspects… WILLIAM KRISTOL OK, well what is the question? The question—"
against,Bush—
for,"The question— Bush has lost fewer court decisions than almost any president has. He lost two five to four decisions. You can, maybe the five were right, maybe Bush shouldn't have gone quite as far as he did in some of the claims he made about Guantanamo. But we are going to have to detain people. We are not going to be able to provide them all civil trials. I do not believe that is a way you can deal with terrorists captured on the battlefield. Why can't you deal with them with military trials? We have an existing—"
against,"We are, he set up a system of military trials— No, he set up his own alternate system. We already had a system of military justice— He signed legislation—"
for,He decided he needed his own—
against,"…that Congress passed. He signed legislation that Congress passed in 2005 and 2006. Karl Rove, let’s bring in Karl Rove. And I just want to say, it’s fine to register your reaction to this with applause. I heard it for Jacob, I haven't heard it for Bill Kristol. I mean, is there a sense of support for, for Bill Kristol’s argument? No, no, no… Karl Rove? Don’t, don’t be doing that again, John, we’ve lost sixty-five/seventeen. Come on, man. I’m delighted that we did better than the Upper West Side— I was trying to get the seventeen to applaud here. You know, we got eight percent of the vote in one of the precincts up here, I mean, come on, man! Come on! All right, look, it’s clever to suggest that we ought to have the military, the style of courtroom justice we provide to our military, and provide that for enemy non-combatants, I mean enemy combatants. We shouldn't. That’s what we attempted to do in the military justice system, is to the greatest possible degree possible duplicate our civil justice system. And are you suggesting that we ought to Mirandize these people and keep a chain of evidence and all the other things that we normally do in both military and civilian courts for terrorists? Not at all, and people have far fewer rights under the military system. But the point is, under your system, they have no rights. The prisoners at Guantanamo were originally denied access to a lawyer, we couldn't even find out who was there, and the original claim by the Bush administration was that this applied to citizens as well as non-citizens. So, if the Bush administration decided that you were suspected of terrorism, you could be held indefinitely without a lawyer, without a hearing, without a trial. You know what—"
for,I'm not saying that these—
against,"With all due respect, you're making it sound like everybody on the Upper West Side needs to worry about being sent to the reeducation camps in Texas. And in reality what it was focused at is, if we picked up a US Citizen who was a terrorist on a battlefield abroad, would we subject him to US law, or would we treat them as a terrorist— 01;23;07"
for,"01;23;07 But here’s what you slipped in, if we picked up someone who’s a terrorist. What if they happen not to be a terrorist? Some of these people have been acquitted."
against,"And the system has a process of review in which that determination can be made. Anyway, the big picture, look, the fact is in the big picture— You're worried about John, John Lindh? You're worried about him?"
for,"I'm, I'm— What I think is extraordinary to people abroad, is that those of us who are enthusiasts for America and American liberties cannot see why you needed to do these things. You will never persuade the outside world that you have not restricted liberty in America. You will never persuade them that you have not taken out Muslims as a particular group, and you will never, and you never persuade them that you really needed to do these things."
against,What things?
for,Because— What have we done to Muslims in America? What has happened? Arrested them.
against,"We’ve arrested Muslims in America? We’ve incarcerated— Rounded, rounded them up? Name one? Nonsense. Name one instance."
for,"The, belabor me all day with lists of people who have vanished. Vanished. You know—"
against,"Well, that— This is on the border of lunacy, with all due respect."
for,"But you didn't need to do it, you didn't need to do it—"
against,We didn't do it!
for,"You’ve got the world believing America is a less robust place, and it really is."
against,"Now, what part of the world is that? Is that—"
for,You— …China and India? Do they have… I'm serious. No.
against,Let’s talk about “the world.”
for,"Yeah, yeah. The world turns out to be a certain class of liberal elites in Western Europe. Not all of Western… It does, it does! Is Bush… Is America unpopular? Has anyone here been, is America unpopular in East Asia? Is America unpopular, has Bush’s policy towards China been terrible in terms of Chinese views? Have we had a, India is a great success story, a rather important, huge democracy, for Bush. Even in Western Europe, when Bush took over, there were rather anti-American prime ministers, democratically elected obviously, in France and in Germany— It’s just not true. Then Merkel wins in Germany, and Sarkozy wins in France. If they're so, if America’s image is so ruined, if they just can't stand America, why did they elect the more pro-American candidate in both of those races? Well they…"
against,"Richard Clarke himself— A question you were asked, who is the worst President of the last fifty years? Look, I mean this is a, you know, this is why this question is a little artificial. I mean, Lyndon Johnson probably made the worst mistake, perhaps, of the last fifty years, with Vietnam, but he also deserves a huge amount of credit, I think, and I’ll say this as a conservative and a Republican, some of what he did in terms of, certainly, civil rights, and I would say something like Medicare. So, people are not, you know, univocally good or bad. I do think, at the same time, personal, corruption of the political system for political, of the judicial system, and of the governmental system for political ends, clearly Nixon. And I would say in terms of just incompetence and leaving the country in dangerous shape which had to be reversed, Carter. So, the seventies was a bad decade, in my opinion, for American presidents, and for America, and for the world. Which was reversed by Reagan. Karl Rove, we had a questioner say that President Bush was a big spender. Yeah, look, I like how first of all you did put, say put aside Homeland Security. Let’s take a look at discretionary domestic spending. The last budget left to us, the FY ’01 budget, left to us by that previous President whose name you can fill in, increased discretionary domestic spending in FY ’01 fifteen percent in one year. That means that would double the discretionary spending of the Federal government, if left at that rate, in five and a half years. We cut, in our first budget, FY ’02, discretionary domestic spending to seven percent, in FY ’03 to four percent, in FY ’04, excuse me, FY ’05, two percent, and six, seven, and eight, have flat lined discretionary domestic spending of the government. Been hard to do. We’re going to leave a big, we’re going to leave an enormous benefit in place for Barack Obama in that we have flat lined discretionary domestic spending. And the biggest, and the biggest spending item is, are two things, the tax cuts, we can debate economic policy, but I think an awful lot of people think especially 2003 tax cuts were sensible and ended up producing, actually, a lot of revenue. And prescription drug benefit, which I would defend as a conservative. Medicare exists, it is a pretty good program, it had to be improved, it had to be updated by bringing prescription drugs into it. It’s come in under budget, and I think, what, ninety-two percent of seniors are covered, and it seems to be working pretty well. Now, if you're a strict, small government libertarian conservative, you would object to Bush starting a new entitlement program, and that’s a defensible, philosophical position, but in that case, the biggest domestic expenditure, the biggest piece of domestic legislation of the Bush administration, it did what Bush said it was going to do. I'm collecting questions again, from the upper left where the camera is. John, could I add a little bit of that to, to— No. In the aftermath of 9/11 the concern was about a tyrant guilty of enormous human rights abuses, but possessed with weapons of mass destruction and an intention to use them as a state sponsor of terror. Absent that, I suspect the administration’s course would have been to work to find more creative ways to constrain him than he’d been constrained in the nineties. The President did have an enormous concern about the human rights abuses under Saddam Hussein. He also had a concern about the deterioration of the credibility of the United Nations, which had passed sixteen resolutions calling upon him to abide by the outcome and the agreements that he made in the aftermath of the ’91, of the first Gulf War, that he’d not lived up to. But absent weapons of mass destruction, no, I don’t think there would have been an invasion. OK, are we set for the question up in the corner up here yet? And otherwise I’ll come up the aisle, if you can come up the aisle, red sweater. Let’s wait till the camera reaches you. Very good, very patient. 01;34;50"
for,"We have a problem here. I just don’t see terrorism as a state projected force in the way that you do. I regard it in the sense that the question was trying to ask before, as a criminal act of gangsters roaming the world, and badly in need of curtailing by their own governments. I think the way we treated international terrorism is to glorify it, to give it the status of a state. We’ve given huge recruiting energy to those people who want to bring young people into this particular odious fold, and I think by declaring war on some governments, I may say not all governments that harbor them, we’ve accorded them a status wholly beyond what they deserve. I believe that my country and your country’s overstated this threat. I just think we’ve overdone it. And in overdoing it, we turned very large numbers of countries in the, particularly in the Islamic world, into state menaces. They themselves are undermined by the status we’ve given to these people. Pakistan being a classic case of that. This is quite a cosmic question. If you declare a very small group of people to be an international menace, you turn them into a sort of hero, and we’ve done that, and it’s been a terrible, terrible mistake."
against,"Because he is hiding in a deep, dark cave in a very dark corner of, in all likelihood, Pakistan. And, to suggest that not every effort has been made to get him is inaccurate. Every effort has been made to get him, to get at his communications, to get at his allies, to get at his subordinates, to get at his inner circle. A lot of them are dead…and we aren’t hearing much from him. And…but we gotta recognize we’re dealing with an odd part of the world, this is not as Simon alluded to, this is not a state. And it operates through states, the Taliban controlled a state, Afghanistan, that harbored and trained and gave succor to these terrorists. But they live in a odd and dark part of the world that is not a state, and it’s what makes destroying al-Qaeda’s leadership and our relationship with Pakistan both two very problematic things. Simon and Jacob, you had two questions along the lines of comparisons of George Bush to both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, with I think the implication that, the President’s Iraq was their Vietnam, can you take on that question?"
for,"When I was a very young journalist, was in Vietnam at the very end of that war, and attended the relevant briefings, and this is not a—a very well-informed comment but, my view was that the Vietnam war and occupation of South Vietnam, was far more competently executed than the occupation of Iraq. The occupation of Iraq, was, and I followed American and British occupation troops around the world for most of my career—the occupation of Iraq was simply the most incompetent thing I’ve ever seen. It was stupefyingly incompetent… And I’ve no doubt at all that many people possibly on the platform wouldn’t disagree with that, because it was conducted by a very small group of people, against the advice of a much larger group of people within the administration. It simply has been a catastrophe. Afghanistan is much better conducted, although I think it’s a much more difficult war to fight. And that’s why I think it’s gonna end in greater tears than Iraq will end, Iraq is fairly simple to end, you just leave. It’ll be very, very difficult to leave Afghanistan. But certainly in Vietnam, I think you had on the whole relatively competent military people there, they had experience in Korea many of them. They lost but they only just lost. I do think that America could’ve stabilized South Vietnam had it stayed longer. It was not the right place to be and the right thing to do, but it was not a hopeless case. I think when you go into a country without a good reason, or with the purpose of simply punishing the country as was the case in both Iraq and Afghanistan, you’re not likely to do well, because you haven’t really plotted what the purpose of the exercise is, it was simply to punish. And I think it’s that punitive element that’s been the problem, certainly in Iraq. And I am sorry I’ve been there only twice, but I cannot accept that it is in any sense of the word a success."
against,"Great— Let me just add to that and just, very briefly, make it a little sharper perhaps. Look, from 1979 on the Iranian revolution and the disastrous Saudi Wahhabi decision to compete with the Iranian revolution by exporting Wahhabi Islam much more aggressively abroad, enabled to do that by the, obviously oil revenues from the ‘70s, that they—once they were able to jack up oil prices in the ‘70s— jihadism, Islamic jihadism, Islamic extremism, terrorism has been unfortunately on the rise doing some damage to us and huge damage obviously, within the Islamic world and in the Middle East, and the greater Middle East and in South Asia. Successful Bush foreign policy, I mean, successful US foreign policy, which would have been begun by President Bush, 10 or 20 years from now, would’ve reversed that and I think we are on the cusp of reversing that. I think that is why the intervention in Iraq, the stabilizing of Iraq as a non-extremist, non-terror-friendly regime in the center of the Middle East, the crushing of al-Qaeda, and there’s some very difficult things to be done with Pakistan but at least so far maintaining some of the decent civilian government in Pakistan, while moving aggressively against the terror, parts of Pakistan that had been for quite a long time, terror-friendly, I mean that, reversing that would be incredibly important, that is really crucial to having a decent 21st century. And I think Bush has begun to reverse it, there’s much more that has to be done, I trust that President Obama will do it. And secondly nuclear weapons. It’s amazing that we have had as little proliferation of nuclear weapons as we’ve had. Many experts think over the last 50 years in retrospect the Pakistani explosion of nuclear weapons in ’98, and I was no more prescient about this than anyone else, was a huge moment, a very dangerous moment, and what"
for,"think Obama should focus as he’s appropriately doing on Afghanistan and how to turn around a deteriorating situation there. I think he should figure out, how to get us out of Iraq without Iraq falling back into the situation it was in before the surge. I think those are com—things that are compatible, I think they’re possible. And, you know, much of this is so invisible to us that it’s very hard when we say Bush has kept us safe. It’s true, we have not had another terrorist attack in the United States. How much of that is the result of policy, how much is the result of accident. We don’t know that much about it, it’s the dog that didn’t bark. Would another President have handled it differently, I don’t think so. I think that it’s—it’s impossible to say. imagine the reason why there’ve been no more attacks in America or in Britain or in most of Europe, is because of good policing on the ground, not because you’ve been at war in the Middle East. I believe in good policing, I think the Kyoto terrorism, whatever that precisely may mean, people blowing people up, is essentially front-line policing. Good intelligence, good espionage, good work on the ground. It’s not by going to war against other states. But the phrase Islamo-fascism, so easily bandied about from this side of the Atlantic, and I may say from Europe, when you travel in these countries the relentlessness of the assumption that every Arab, every Muslim is a crypto-Islamo-fascist. And the evidence you give of it, by going in and invading some of their countries, is the surest possible way to turn them into hostile— I cannot emphasize enough— Well, I repeat my view at the very beginning. I'm not here to be rude about an American President. I would just point out about Iraq, you cannot say something’s a success when I saw last week two million Iraqi’s are camped outside Damascus because they haven't got the nerve to go home to their homeland because the Americans are there."
against,"No, I mean I myself tend…not to use the word Islamo-fascism, I just think it’s a little, analytically confusing, I’m not sure fascism is the best way to describe them but, the Islamo-fascists if you wanna use that term, the Takfiris, the terror— Islamic terrorists have killed more Muslims than anyone—than they’ve killed Westerners. And if you talk to Muslims they want those people, to many Muslims including many in Iraq, the greatest single vic—what country has been the greatest victim of the terrorists of al-Qaeda? Iraqis, Iraqi Muslims. And they are grateful now that they are going to be able to vote in 2009 in regional elections and in national elections and have a shot at not having a horrible dictator who himself murdered hundreds of thousands of people, who are not being dominated by ghastly Islamo-fascists if you wanna use the word, but I do think, I sort of agree with the question in that sense— Precisely using the term Islamo-fascist separates, the reason you use the term is precisely to say that’s not all of Islam, that’s a little part of it which unfortunately has been ascendant, and if not resisted, will become more ascendant, and we need to help people resist it, we can’t stand back and say hey, none of our business, Afghanistan, Taliban takes over, so tough on you, you know, and Saddam, tough on you guys, and I guess in the Sudan, it’s tough, and other places it’s tough and the Iranian civil society gets suppressed, and I guess we just can’t say anything. And we just say hey, that’s the way they wanna live in that part of the world, I mean that is really what the counsel I think of these sort of realists who want us to think they are going to improve America’s standing in the world and in fact, will correctly call down condemnation on America as has happened in the past. Incidentally, one of the things that encouraged radicalism in the Middle East, was the sense that we were standing aside, and supporting dictators out of narrow self-interest. The single greatest harm we did to ourselves was stepping back in ’91, we went in to kick Saddam out of Kuwait which was correct, we needed to do so for strategic reasons, and then we abandoned the people of Iraq, when Saddam turned on them, I don’t think that’s something to be proud of and I very much hope actually that Barack Obama does not revert to that kind of foreign policy. I’d like to quickly— I’d like to quickly return to a question about why was America kept safe for seven years. We’re given two answers, one was luck and the other was that any other President would’ve handled it the same way. Now luck does come into play. But luck works when you have the kinda attitude that this President has which is he’s gonna stay on the offense so we fight ‘em over there, and we’re gonna use every intelligence tool at our disposal, to find out what they’re up to. That is why we broke some of the plots that you know about publicly. You don’t know about all the plots but you know about the attempt to bring down Liberty Tower in Los Angeles, or to blow up airliners simultaneously over the Pacific Ocean. We’re able to break up those plots because this President adopted programs—now maybe, Jacob is right that any other President would’ve pursued the terrorist surveillance program, and the widespread use of our intelligence assets abroad, to listen in on the enemy. I hope he’s right. What do you mean, Karl, by fight them over there, they weren’t in Iraq. Unless you meant somewhere else by over there. Well first of all, again I repeat, I appreciate you support for the war in Iraq at the time. Well, I wasn’t— But Jacob, but let’s be honest, he was supporting terrorists, this is a man who, who gave payments to terror bombers. This is a guy who allowed terrorist camps to organize in his country. The ricin attack in London was launched from a camp in northeast Iraq, this is not a nation which you can organize a terrorist camp without the central authorities knowing about it—"
for,"Hang on— In the aftermath of Afghanistan and taking down the Taliban, where did Zarqawi go for medical treatment. He checked himself into the Mayo Clinic of Baghdad. You don’t get that unless somebody in the government up top allows a known terrorist to seek, to seek succor and medical care in Baghdad, this was a bad actor. Now, did we think he had weapons of mass destruction, you bet, and I’ve got a sheaf-load of quotes from people that you love, like Ted Kennedy and others saying he did. He didn’t. We now know that. We went in on intelligence that was flawed, but I would remind you of this. Intelligence gets it wrong both ways. In the run-up to Iraq Muammar Qaddafi looked around and said you know the United States is serious about it, Britain is serious about this, I got problems. If they’re willing to take out 25 million people and take on Iraq with 25 million people they’re willing to take me on. And he coughed up his weapons programs. And Western intelligence found out they were wrong, they systematically underestimated how far along his chemical and biological programs were which were weaponized, and how far along his nuclear program which—which was way beyond what anybody in Western intelligence thought he had. What was this ricin attack in Britain. Milk powder, milk powder. Simon— Thanks. We’re out of time on the questions and answers but you have two minutes to sum up, and you can respond to the point there, I just wanna thank all of you, and encourage you to give yourselves a round of applause for terrific questions. So, I wanna remind you where we are in this Intelligence Squared US debate. We’ve already polled you when you came in before the debate began to see where you agree on the motion. The motion before us is, “George W. Bush is the worst President of the last 50 years.” “Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years,” before the debate, 65 percent of you agreed with the motion, 17 percent were against, 18 percent, one in five of you roughly, were undecided, and we’re going to poll you again shortly but now we move on to the final session of the debate in which each of the panelists has two minutes to summarize. I will step in at the two-minute mark just to tell you that your time is up, and we are going to begin the summary against the motion, that George W. Bush is the worst President of the last 50 years, Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard. As someone who grew up not far from here it’s embarrassing frankly that 83 percent of the people who voted think either that Bush is the worst President in 50 years or are undecided about it. Look, people don’t have to like Bush, half the country voted against him in 2000 and—well, virtually almost half in 2004, if you’re a liberal you won’t approve of his domestic policies, if you think that we’d be better off not having gone into Iraq which obviously is a debatable proposition, you could be very condemnatory of going into Iraq and certainly many people have criticized the way in which we managed that war from 2004 to 2006. There’s no reason not to be critical of Bush, not to disagree with Bush, not to prefer Obama, not to have voted for Gore and Kerry, most people in New York obviously, have all those views. But to think that he’s the worst President in 50 years is just silly. It’s just silly and it came out very well in the Vietnam discussion, I mean are we being serious here? Vietnam was well-run and that was okay somehow and, you know, Westmoreland knew what he was doing. Of course we lost 55,000 people, we lost a war, 2 million people plus died in Vietnam and Cambodia, it was an unbelievable catastrophe, which the region took a long time to recover from, it was a terrible humiliation moral and political for the United States. That’s like Iraq? Where we’ve lost 4,000 soldiers, where Iraq is now back on its feet, where we’ve won the war, where we’ve won the war and established US credibility and a willingness to stick to it even though we’ve made terrible mistakes and where we’re actually in pretty good shape with most of the governments in the region, I myself being more of a democracy and human rights activist am a little unhappy that we’re so friendly—"
