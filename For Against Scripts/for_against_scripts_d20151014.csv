for,"It's a pleasure to be here. I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me and thank all of you folks for coming out to listen to us debate this issue tonight. Of course Peter and I are going to make the argument that China will be a long-term enemy of the United States. I want to start with two preliminary points. One is the argument here is not that we're destined to fight a war. It's that these two countries will be long-term enemies. You want to remember that during the Cold War the United States and Soviet Union were enemies, but they never fought a war thankfully, and we're not arguing that that is the case with regard to China. We're just saying they're going to be enemies. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 10/15/2015 Second, when you talk about the future, there's no way you can talk about it without a theory of international politics or a theory of great power politics. And the reason is we have no evidence about the future because the evidence isn't there because the future hasn't happened yet. So you need a theory to explain what you think is going to happen and that theory, of course, has to be able to explain past cases where great powers rose and fell, and it has to be applicable to the present as well. So the division of labor between me and Peter this evening is that I'm going to lay out the simple theory that explains why China and the United States are destined to compete with each other, to have an intense security competition that involves arms races, crises, proxy wars and so forth and so on. And then what Peter's going to do when he follows me, is he's going to show you all the evidence that's already out there that supports the story that I'm going to tell you. My story basically goes like this: If you look at the international system the way it's organized, there are three characteristics of that system that force states to compete for power and to pursue greater and greater increments of power. The first characteristic of the system is that there is no higher authority that sits above states. There's no night watchman. States are like pool balls on a table. That means that if a state gets into trouble, there's nobody it can turn to rescue. As I like to say to students, ""In the international system, when you dial 911, there's nobody at the other end."" That means it is, in effect, a self-help system. That's characteristic one. Characteristic two is that all states have some offensive military capability, and there are invariably a few states that have a lot of offensive military capability. The third feature of the system has to do with intentions. It's almost impossible to divine the future intentions of other states because we don't even know who's going to be running China in five years or 10 years or 15 years. We don't know who's going to be running the United States in five, 10, or 15 years. What this means is that when you operate in a world where there's no higher authority you can turn to when you get into trouble, and you may end up next to a store -- a country that's very powerful and has malign intentions, you quickly figure out that the best way to survive is to be very powerful. As we used to say, when I was a young boy in New York City playgrounds, you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block, not because you're malicious or you have bad intentions, but it's the best way to survive, because the more powerful you are, the safer you are. Now, what this means in practical terms is that states want to, number one, dominate their region of the world, and number two, they want to make sure they don't have a peer competitor. That Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 10/15/2015 means you want to make sure there's not another state in the system that dominates its region of the world like you do. Let's talk a little bit about the United States. The United States is the only regional hegemon in modern history. Most Americans don't think about this, but the Founding Fathers and their successors went to enormous lengths to ensure that we would dominate the Western hemisphere. That involved conquering huge swaths of territory and making sure that the power gap between us and Mexico and us and Canada, us and Brazil, us and Guatemala, was enormous so that they could not cause us any trouble. Second thing we did was we instituted the Monroe Doctrine. We basically threw the European great powers out of the Western hemisphere and told them that they were not welcome back in here, because we did not want any distant great powers coming into the Western hemisphere. That was all about establishing hegemony in the Western hemisphere. Second goal, which is reflected in U.S. foreign policy in the 20th century, is to make sure we do not have a peer competitor. There were four potential peer competitors in the 20th century: Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union. The United States played a key role not only in making sure each one of those countries did not dominate either Europe or Asia, but also played a key role in putting all four of those countries on the scrapheap of history. The United States does not tolerate peer competitors. And the United States, to go back to my first point, is deeply committed to dominating the Western hemisphere. Now let's talk about China. As China gets more and more powerful -- and that's going to happen -- the question you have to ask yourself is what will China do with all that military power? My argument is that China will imitate the United States. They'd be crazy not to. They're going to try to dominate Asia the way we dominate the Western hemisphere. If you're in Beijing and you're a national security adviser, don't you want a China that is much more powerful than all its neighbors? The Chinese understand full well what happened the last time they were weak. They call it the century of national humiliation. They know what the Japanese, the Americans and the European great powers did to them, so they want to be very, very powerful, and for good reason. And they're going to want to push the United States out of the -- East Asia. They'd be crazy not to. As my mother taught me when I was a little boy, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If we can have a Monroe Doctrine, why do you think they're not going to have a Monroe Doctrine? So China's going to try to dominate Asia. Then the question Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - 10/15/2015 becomes, what do you think the United States is going to do? The historical record is very clear here. We don't tolerate peer competitors. We're not going to let them dominate Asia if we can prevent it. In effect, this is what the pivot to Asia is all about. We see them rising, and we want to maintain our dominant position in Asia. The end result of this is the Chinese are going to push in one direction, and we're going to push in the other direction, and it is going to be an intense security competition. Again, this is not to say we're going to have a war. But the Chinese are going to do this not because they have a voracious appetite for tromping on people or if they have a particular aggressive gene. It's because the best way to survive in the international system is to be a regional hegemon. They understand that, and at the same time we're not going to let it happen.",
against,"Well, thanks to all of you for coming out tonight. Remember that our motion is that the United States and China are long-term enemies, are now and will remain enemies. The motion is not that the United States and China may become enemies in the future. Bear the wording of the motion in mind. It's very important. Our opponents' position is that the United States and China are now and have no real option except to continue to remain enemies. Why? Because a social science theory says that nations base their strategies on a survivalist ethic. Even though the question the United States and China face is not how to survive, but how to flourish. We're reduced to our basest instincts. The dire outcome that our opponents are forecasting tonight is avoidable for reasons that Kevin and I are going to spell out. And it's also avoidable because the Chinese read Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - 10/15/2015 Mearsheimer, ardently. They’ve read this theory. An even though he tells them that seeking hegemony in the Eastern hemisphere is a good idea, that there are sound strategic reasons, he goes on to describe a world that would ensue that no one in China or the United States would desire. In fact, he just admitted that when someone does what he tells China to do, the United States throws you on the scrapheap of history. This is a world we can avoid if we manage the relationship wisely. I am going to demonstrate that for the past 37 years, despite our disparate values, despite crises, despite a relationship that is already highly competitive, the U.S. and China have avoided enmity and have benefited from engagement. We are not enemies now. Our opponents don't even claim that we are, in contradiction to the motion. I will show you also that the world -- what the world would look like in our own opponents' scheme if we were to become enemies, in hopes of convincing you that we should expend every effort to avoid that outcome. Kevin will then challenge the predictive reliability of the social science model in question, and he will demonstrate that despite serious threats to the relationship, the United States and China have the motive and the means to contain our competition within peaceful boundaries. Enemies, talking about enemies tonight. Fundamentally hostile powers who wish each other ill. For enemies, the prospect of war is always in the foreground of a relationship, although not all enemies fight. I want to emphasize from the beginning that the threat of enmity between the United States and China is real and it is not yet clear that we are going to have the wisdom to avoid this outcome. Our opponents have done a wonderful job of putting -- of raising this alarm in very stark terms. But we do have to note that we are not enemies now, despite our current concerns. The U.S. is not containing China's rise. In fact, we have promoted that rise. We have aided and abetted it. The record of engagement with China is lopsided. China benefits more than we do, but we benefit as well. Trade. China is our third largest export market after Canada and Mexico. The China market is essential to the work of American corporations and the Americans they hire; Apple, G.M., Qualcomm, Intel, IBM, Proctor & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the import of cheap goods from China was one of the key factors that helped low-income Americans to weather the storms of the 2008 financial crisis. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - 10/15/2015 China now invests in the United States. Cumulative foreign direct investment 54 billion, which puts 80,000 Americans to work. 7.3 million Chinese tourists will have visited here by 2021, bringing 85 billion annually. We benefit from trade. We also benefit from Chinese talent. Over 2 million Chinese students have studied here since the opening in 1979. And many of them have remained to contribute to our society. Over two million Chinese immigrants now live in the United States. It is the third largest foreign born group after Mexicans and Indians. And they contribute greatly to every aspect of the society. Ten Chinese-Americans have won Nobel Prizes as United States citizens – I’m sorry, 10 Chinese immigrants. Five of them were born in China. There's a friend of mine at the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Brookes's organization, a couple of years ago who said, ""United States-China relations are not just political, economic, and military, they are now personal."" The Chinese have become our friends, neighbors, colleagues, co-parishioners. It may seem like a cheap move to bring the personal element into this debate about international affairs, but it's actually an essential point. There is scant mention of individual wellbeing in John's theory. Nation states are the fundamental players in his anarchic world. But it is individual human beings that are imperiled by this contest for dominance. What does enmity look like? What would it be like to have China as an enemy? John Mearsheimer himself provides the answer in the final chapter of ""The Tragedy of Great Power Politics."" He says that even if we avoid full-scale war, which would be Armageddon, we will face crises, major disputes that threaten war; an arms race, which I don't think we can afford; proxy wars, in which third country citizens will die for our purported benefit; bait and bleed strategies to lure the other country into costly foolish wars; bloodletting strategies to prolong those conflicts. The U.S. will begin barring Chinese students from its universities and we'll cut down travel restrictions. That's just a partial list. Enmity would also involve a betrayal of America's professed values. Why? As John Mearsheimer says, the United States' interests would be best served by slowing Chinese growth rather than accelerating it. He advocates that we harm -- deliberately harm the welfare of one fifth of humankind to maintain our position as the hegemon. Our opponents say that we are now and will remain long term enemies because of a theory and because of Chinese intentions and capabilities which dictate that it must be so. This is their idea. We should answer them -- we must answer them as Ebenezer Scrooge answered the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come in his dementor’s cloak, pointing a bony finger at a grave. Scrooge said, ""Are these the shadows of things that will be or are they the shadows of things that may be Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - 10/15/2015 only? Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which if persevered in they must lead. But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus."" The message that Kevin and I bring tonight is that it can be thus and it must be. That is why you must vote against the motion tonight, again, that the United States and China are now and are going to remain long-term enemies. Our opponents are correct about the gravity of the challenge. That's why we're having this debate here tonight. But we do have choices about how we meet and manage those challenges, choices that Kevin will soon elucidate for you. Thank you.",1.0
for,"Thank you. My colleague, John, did a great job of developing a framework about how great powers act, and unfortunately it's not a happy story. I'm -- my job here tonight is going to give -- in the first opening, my opening statement is to give some texture and context to what - - the paradigm that -- as -- that paradigm that John set up as it relates to China and the United States. In my opinion, China and the United States are strategic competitors, they're strategic rivals, and they're even enemies. The rhetoric itself bears this out. If you listen to the Chinese, they say that the United States is trying to “encircle” or “contain” China, the U.S. is an “hegemon,” a dominant power, which has a very strong negative connotation, ""the U.S. wants to prevent China's rise --"" this is coming out of Beijing -- ""the U.S. feels --"" and you see this in commentators here in the United States -- ""that China is trying to push the United States out of Asia, that China wants to replace the United States as the preeminent power in the Pacific as the number one world power. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 10/15/2015 Both sides agree that there's a very high level of strategic distrust between the United States and China. It gets worse. The United States and China share important interests in several global hotspots or flashpoints. The oldest, of course, is Taiwan, not getting a lot of press lately, things have been quiet, but China says it's part of the People's Republic of China. The United States says don't try to change the status quo by force. China refuses to renounce the use of force, and the world -- the U.S. would probably resist China trying to unify Taiwan with China using force. This is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. It's been ongoing since 1949, and it's certainly going to remain a point of tension between the United States and China. Another old one is the Korean Peninsula. Most people don't think about this. China and the United States fought there during the Korean War. China backs North Korea, its ally. The U.S. backs South Korea, its ally. War on the Korean Peninsula, in my estimation, is possible at any time. If you talk to U.S. forces Korea their motto is ready to fight tonight, and that's a possibility, especially when you're dealing with the leadership up there in North Korea. And if there is a fight there, it would likely involve the United States and China. The most recent flashpoints are the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Let me start with the East China Sea. The PRC, the People's Republic of China, has a territorial dispute in the East China Sea with American ally, Japan. The U.S. says that these islands, known in Japan as Senkaku, known in China as the Diaoyu, or the Diaoyutai, are under ""Japan's administration,"" quote unquote, and that they fall under the U.S. Japan defense treaty. That means that the United States could intervene if China decides to aggress against these Japanese islands. To make this issue tenser, China has declared an air defense identification zone, an ADIZ, over the East China Sea that includes these islands. And right afterwards, the United States after China declared this ADIZ, the United States sent two B-52 bombers through this ADIZ to -- as a symbol of strength that -- and to make a point to China about their declaration. In the South China Sea, China now claims 80 percent of that body of water. They say it's Chinese sovereign territory. By Beijing's measure, the South China Sea is essentially a Chinese lake. Chinese says that the sovereignty over that body of water and the islands in it are indisputable. To ensure this, they’re building islands on coral reefs and rocky outcrops. On those islands they're also building ports and air fields. Of particular interest is that on one of the islands the runway is 3,000 Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - 10/15/2015 meters long. That's about 10,000 feet. Longer than any commercial aircraft would need for landing, but it will host any of China's military aircraft. The Pacific commander recently said that some of these air fields have revetments that are meant to house or hangar tactical fighters. The U.S. is concerned, to say the least. Seeding sovereignty rights to China could give Beijing the green light to control freedom of the seas and air in the South China Sea. Through the South China Sea flows 1.5 -- or I'm sorry, $5 trillion worth of commerce. Thirty percent of the world's seaborne commerce flows through the South China Sea, $1.2 trillion of that is American. Eighty percent of Japan’s, South Korea’s, and Taiwan's, both either allies or partners of the United States, 80 percent of their imported energy goes through the South China Sea. Some islands in territory that China claims belong to U.S. allies, such as the Philippines. In the coming weeks, the Pentagon has announced that they will sail American war ships through the disputed waters around these new islands. China isn't happy about that at all. While conflict over any or all of these scenarios is inevitable, both sides are bracing themselves for confrontation, crisis, and possibly conflict. Scholars on both sides of the Pacific are talking and writing about the what-if questions if crisis comes between the U.S. and China. Indeed neither side is beating their swords into plowshares. They're making new and better swords. China has an anti-access aerial denial strategy -- this is what the Pentagon calls it -- to deter, delay, or deny U.S. intervention in the western Pacific. The U.S. has the air/sea battle, a strategy to defeat the anti-access aerial denial strategy, although the United States that is -- says that isn't directed at any one country. China's involved in a massive military modernization program, double digit increases in its defense budget over the last 25 years. Emphasis on power projection. They're building aircraft carriers. They've -- they're sending their nuclear deterrent to sea in fleet ballistic missile submarines. They're building stealth fighters. They're exercising significant cyber warfare capabilities, including against the United States, and preparing to fight in space. The U.S. is countering with a Pacific rebalance. Sixty percent of American ships are going to the Pacific. The U.S. Army is growing its presence. Top U.S. weapons technology is being sent to the Pacific theater first. That includes F-22s, littoral combat ships, the J-35 strike fighter. None of this sounds very friendly, isn't it? That's because it isn't. It's clear that China and the United States are competitors, rivals, indeed enemies. This isn't going to change any time soon. It's a regrettable fact. I strongly recommend that you vote for this motion. Thank you very much. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

against,"The proposition we're looking at tonight's a serious one. It's no ordinary proposition. Think about it. The proposition we're being asked to consider is that China and the United States are long-term enemies. Weigh those words carefully. These are important words. ""Long-term enemies,"" that they cannot escape from this condition of enmity. This is extreme language. Using the term ""enemy"" in international relations is something we rarely do, but not in this proposition. It's a term we should use with extreme caution. Think of the definition of what an enemy is. A country you are fighting a war against, the soldiers, et cetera of that country. Let us not gloss over the gravity of the language which is being employed in this proposition. It's not just words. It means something much more fundamental. What we intend to do tonight is to defeat this proposition on three grounds. One it is theoretically dubious; two, practically, as Robert has just demonstrated, it does not reflect the current reality, in all of its dimensions and in all of its complexity of the current U.S.-China relationship; and three, it is dangerously determinist in the sense that it says to us all, we can't do anything about it. It's written in the skies. And that effectively is what John's theory of offensive realism says. John said before you needed a theory to explain what is going on because we can't predict the future. But then occurs the first fundamental logical step in his argument. That fundamental, logical step is as follows: He says that we should take, therefore, at face value, the proposition that a theory of international relations can be reliably predictive. Where is that mysteriously established? Is it written in the stars? No, it's not. It is simply an assertion. And in fact, if you look at the whole body of literature on international relations, there are as many people arguing against the proposition that you can be predictive about anything in the social sciences, let alone in politics, let alone in international relations, let alone a theory which says the United States and China are going to be and are now enemies. There is something that the scholars would describe, too, as overcoming physics envy. What do they mean by Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 10/15/2015 that? That there’s the hard sciences out there, the biological sciences, the physical sciences. They have predictive laws. We can use that method. And the social sciences devise the same sort of principles which can therefore predict human behavior. Well, pigs might fly. There is a huge body of counterevidence to that. But for this to be the foundational proposition of John's argument, that because he has a theory called offensive realism, international relations, it is, by definition, predictive of where the United States and China are and will be is of itself logically flawed. The second logical flaw in the argument is as follows: He said before that it is clear to us all that we cannot predict the future intentions of states. I think I've got that right, John. We cannot predict the future intentions of states. I then listened carefully to John list four separate predictions about China's attitude. China will want to demonstrate and demonstrate through its behavior its domination of East Asia, just like the U.S. did. That's a statement of intention. You then go on to say that they'll want to push the United States out of Asia. That's a statement of your conclusions about Chinese intentions. You have said they want to be original hegemon. That's a statement of Chinese intentions, and that we, the United States, won't want them to do that. That's a statement of American intentions. You cannot have your cake and eat it too, and say, we cannot predict a state's intentions and list four areas in which you are making those precise predictions. It's not just logically inconsistent, it's dangerous, because by being so predictive, it infers that conflict and war are somehow inevitable. That is not our proposition, not our proposition at all. I also have a theoretical premise. Some would say it's Marxist. Listen to this. Politics, international politics, is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong -- the wrong remedies, so says Groucho Marx. When we look at the proposition which is before us, it is theoretically flawed. And as my colleague Robert has demonstrated, it doesn't bear any relationship to the complex reality which is unfolding in U.S.-China relations, across politics, across commerce, and across people-to-people engagement. But what I'm fundamentally concerned about is additional argument against this proposition, it is dangerously determinist. It says that we, through diplomacy or political leadership cannot affect an action. It is basically saying that international relations, we've now got the application of Calvinist predestination. It's all out there and we can't stop it. That's what offensive realism has Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 10/15/2015 as its core proposition. It's a bit like saying that Nixon and Mao had nothing to do through their individual diplomatic activity in changing the course of the future of U.S.- China relations. Well, they did through leadership. It's arguing that Deng Xiaoping had no impact possibly individually on China's economic future, that that was somehow automatically written in the stars. That's wrong. Individual political leaders do make a difference. And so it goes on with others who have contributed to the U.S.-China relationship. The point is this: There is nothing determinist about international relations. We decide on our futures between countries just as we decide upon our futures between ourselves. It is a matter of what the theorist would describe as human agency. We get to make the choice. And through our political leaders, we can choose to make a choice. An alternative approach is what I call constructive realism; not offensive realism, but constructive realism. Recognize the realist differences which exist between America and -- and China; recognize that there are fundamental differences in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, over Taiwan, on cyber, in space, on human rights, but at the same time recognize that there are multiple domains of constructive engagement. How do you deal conjointly with the problem of North Korean nuclear proliferation? How do you deal now conjointly with the problems of terrorism in Central Asia which afflicts China as much as anybody else? How do we grow the global economy through our combined growth strategies? These are areas of constructive engagement which can build political capital over time and help us deal with the fundamental problems of the future in this relationship as well.",1.0
for,"Yes, my three points about the structure of the system, the third point was that you cannot know intentions. That was a starting assumption. And what I did was I took all three of the assumptions and then you mix them together. And what that does is cause states to pursue hegemony and to prevent a peer competitor. So there's no question that once you mix all of the assumptions together, right, the uncertainty of that intentions, you do get certainty about intentions in that states do pursue hegemony.",2.0

You cannot on the one hand provide a theory which seeks to be descriptive of a current reality normative about what that future reality might be and at the same time suggest that you're not providing a description of predictive intent on the part of the other country and then walk away from describing the fact that, that is their predictive intent. It is either determinist, which it is, of the level of determinism, which Georg Friedrich Hegel would be embarrassed, or it leaves an option for diplomacy and what we call ""human agency.""

Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - 10/15/2015 what we will settle for. China is constrained. It can't have everything that it wants in its fondest dreams, and it knows it. Why? It faces tremendous domestic pressures, problems of political legitimacy and stability, the challenge of continued economic development -- you all know that the Chinese economy is slowing, we are feeling it here in our stock market -- problems of polluted, not only air and water, but land which takes longer to abate, a water shortage in the north, income disparity, no -- very poor social safety net.

On the TPP you just referred to, and it's a good example, what I note is once the TPP is passed, at least in terms of negotiations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, what you now find is that China's public language is changed from one of outright hostility to one of saying, ""I wonder how in fact we can now get into this.""

Your point about what alternative options exist other than seeking to economically strangle a country is as follows: In the period leading up to the first world war, if you read, I think, the seminal text called ""Sleep Walking to War,"" published in 2013-14, it points to a failure of diplomacy between Berlin, Paris and Vienna and London in the critical months of July of 1914, where diplomacy could have averted conflict.

The state visit of Xi Jinping just recently to the United States was a very tense relationship, very tense meeting. Talking about cyber, the Chinese have pilfered 20 plus million, personal information, 20 plus million American government employees, including myself. And the U.S. chamber of commerce will tell you they're dealing with the most hostile business climate in China today that they've ever faced before. And, of course, this issue of the South China Sea. So nobody doubts that diplomacy can have a positive role. But I'm telling you today, based on all the things that I've told you, that diplomacy's failing. I think the answer to that is no. And I think if you look at U.S.-Russian relations today, and you look at U.S.-Chinese relations today, and you look at U.S.-Iranian relations today, those are three glaring examples that contradict what you say. When we expanded NATO and the EU eastward, we thought that international politics had changed, that realpolitik was finished and we could get away with expanding NATO and the EU, and it would have no consequences. We found out exactly the opposite was the case, because Putin is a first-class realpolitiker. The same thing applies to East Asia. There's all sorts of evidence out there that the Chinese think in realpolitik terms. And if you look at the competition that's beginning to brew, it runs against the argument that international politics has changed. Look at the Middle East today. It's hard to believe that all these new theories that were put on the table when the Cold War ended apply there. So there are just lots of examples where there's trouble in the system.",2.0

We see Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia. So even within the system we see balances that are going to constrain China. Well, with China there's always going to be competition, there's always going to be cooperation. Both these realities are always confronting us every day of the week. On this one in terms of China's investment program through the Asian infrastructure investment bank and investment fund and other such financial entities, the Chinese spot an economic opportunity. They see there's overcapacity in the construction industry within their own country. They want to actually be able to export that and grow the infrastructure of Southern and Central Asia through to the Middle East at the same time. My argument is there's a market there. There's a huge deficit in infrastructure in that part of the world. Why not U.S.-Chinese entrepreneurs get together and make a buck together, build infrastructure, and at the same time improve the livelihoods of those in that part of the world? There are a large list of cooperative possibilities in finance and in commerce between U.S. and Chinese firms.

It's my sense that China never plans to experience that again and are making steps to do so. It plans to return China to its former glory as the middle kingdom. This is what President Xi Jinping has talked about when he talks about the ""China dream."" The major obstacle to achieving that is the United States. As a result, as evidenced by areas of disagreement and the buildup of military forces, China and the United States are in an intense struggle for power and Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

Whether we like it or not, China and the United States are enemies in the category of U.S.-Iran, U.S.-North Korea, and the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins. It's that serious. We're enemies. We want the same things and that's to be at the top of the international system. Until one side gives up its challenge to the status quo or the other side acquiesces to the challenger's rise, it's going to be that way. In my opinion, that's not likely to happen. The China that our opponents have talked about is not the China of the past. It's a superpower. That means that China and the United States are long-term enemies and I recommend that you vote for this motion. Thank you very much.",3.0
against,"John Mearsheimer admits in his writing that social science theory is a crude instrument. Those are his words. But even if it were a far more precise instrument, it would still be only one of the tools in a very large toolkit that we have at our disposal, a toolkit that includes deft creative diplomacy, the balancing of interests, judicious restraint, economic and political lovers, our moral sense, a due fear of our capacity for violence, consideration for the opinions and the interests of other nations, and common concern for transnational threats like climate change and pandemics. All of these instruments, if we wield them properly, will enable us to manage this relationship such that we do not become enemies and we are not enemies now. We are not helpless witnesses to the unfolding of grand historical loss. It's a dangerous world, but it's not a Risk board. There's more to it than that. There's far more to Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

We must build and position our forces wisely, yes, but we must not reduce our collective life to a brutalist survival imperative. I work at a think tank, sometimes hard to explain to my kids what I do with this. I'm not a fireman or a policeman and they ask, so I just say well, I work all day to try to make sure that the United States and China don't fight, and as I was getting ready for this debate the other night my second son, Mateo, who was born in China and grew up there for six years, born to a Chinese mother, said, ""Dad if we fight, who would I fight for, China or America?"" And I said, ""Well, you'd fight for America, Bub, but it need not come to that."" It need not come to that. That is our position. We are not nor are we destined to become enemies and we encourage you to vote against the motion. Thank you.",3.0
for,"Thank you, John. As I said early on, you can't talk about the future without a theory, and I think that they have a theory and it revolves around agency or diplomacy. They believe that the competition can be managed and that's very different than the way I think about the issue. But I want to ask you this -- when you look at American diplomacy over the past 20 years, does that give you confidence? Does that give you confidence that American leaders can manage this relationship – -- over the next 30 or 40 years? You know about Afghanistan. You know about Iraq. You know about Libya. You know about Ukraine. Seems to me the United States has the Midas touch in reverse. It's really quite remarkable. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - 10/15/2015 And for their theory to work not only do you need Bismarck after Bismarck after Bismarck on our side – -- but you also need it on the Chinese side, and just to add to the problem, we have lots of allies out there who could drag us into a war. We could have some crazy Filipino or some crazy Japanese leader or somebody who acted irrationally. There are a lot of moving pieces out there. There are a lot of ways you can get into a war, but what their theory depends on is having Bismarck here, there and everywhere. That's just not going to happen. Look. You should vote for us not because it makes you feel good about the situation – -- you should feel very depressed about this. Really, really. This is a very depressing conclusion that he and I are putting forward. I love going to China. I love the Chinese people and I hate to say what I've said up here tonight, but if you have any hope of managing the situation, you want to be realistic about where we're headed and they are not realistic.",3.0
against,"As former prime minister of one of your closer allies in the Pacific – Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - 10/15/2015 -- therefore one of those moving pieces which could get you into all sorts of trouble – And I remind you your oldest continuing ally in the 20th century and into the 21st, and a country that has fought with you in every war in the last century, ""Comma "" -- I think we deserve to have a voice at the table on these questions. And I say that because we have a deep affection to the United States for a whole bunch of reasons; your civil tradition, the celebration of democracy, your economic creativity. And frankly, in the history of global super powers, the post 40 -- in the -- going back through time, America has behaved as a remarkably benign superpower. I say that, say it freely, and I say it openly. This say tough debate because we're dealing with something brand-new; the rise of a country which is not English speaking, which is not Western, which is not a democracy, and is on the verge of becoming the largest economy in the world. I get the complexity of being -- working with this country in one capacity or another for the last 35 years, either as a student, an academic, in business, as a member of parliament, as a foreign minister, as a prime minister. And the complexity is staring at us in the face every day because we're your ally in the region. But I say this: There is nothing determinist, nothing sketched into the skies above which says that the United States and China are and therefore will be long-term enemies. There is, in my view, nobody of any serious position in either Washington or Beijing who wants war. I've met most of these folks over the last decade. The challenge of diplomacy is to ensure that we prevent that from happening. I believe we can. For your kids' future, I -- I ask you to vote against the proposal. In Australia, we say, ""Vote early, vote often.""",3.0
