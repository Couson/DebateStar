for,"Well thank you very much indeed, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you tonight, nothing would be easier, than to blame everything on the bankers. Think of Richard Fuld…of Lehman Brothers. In 2007 his compensation, for the year, was $72 million. The year before his firm collapsed. Never to be seen again. Or James Cayne of Bear Stearns who made $290 million, in the nine years before his firm vanished without trace. Not only were the bankers greedy, we would agree. They were also, in many cases, incompetent. But I and my colleagues are not here to praise them, or to defend them. We blame them for much of what has gone wrong. It’s just that we blame the politicians…more. We’ve already heard quoted tonight that wonderful saying of Chuck Prince, as long as the music is playing you have to get up and dance but you have to ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, who was playing the music. You know, it’s so easy, to heap opprobrium on Wall Street right now. It’s just too easy. And if you noticed, that’s exactly what the politicians do. I couldn’t help but notice, in President Obama’s inaugural address, an allusion to greed, and irresponsibility. And only yesterday, he was denouncing, and I quote, “The recklessness and greed of the bonuses paid to executives at the insurance company AIG.” It was just the same in the last Great Depression, I think of this as the Slight Depression. FDR in his inaugural address, heaped scorn on the rulers of the exchange and the unscrupulous money-changers. Ladies and gentlemen, you have to ask yourselves…why do the politicians always wax so indignant about finance at times like these? Could it just possibly be that they’re trying to divert our attention away from Washington’s own responsibility for the debacle? What I want to do in the brief time I have available is to invite you to consider the roles played by four institutions, in bringing about this financial crisis, and I also want you to reflect on the location of those institutions. The first is the Federal Reserve Board. Its role has been to allow a housing bubble to inflate, and burst, between January of 2001 and June of 2003, the Fed cut its federal funds rate from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. Then over three years it very gradually, by quarter-points, raised rates up to 5.25 percent. In that time, ladies and gentlemen, house price inflation in this country, rose from 7 percent, to 17 percent a year, and it stayed above 15 percent a year, right until January of 2006. This was the period when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, proclaimed the advent of a great moderation, in economic life, yes, that was the title of his lecture in 2004. “Some moderation.” The location of the Federal Reserve Board, is the Eccles Building, Constitution Avenue, Washington D.C. The second institution, that I’d like to draw your attention to is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which under Christopher Cox, allowed the leverage in the banking system to spiral out of all control, from some 12 to 1, to as we’ve already heard this evening somewhere in the region of 20 to 30 to 1, in the case of the big investment banks. And that was a conscious decision by the SEC. The location of the SEC, ladies and gentlemen, 100 F Street Northwest, Washington, D.C. My third prime suspect is Congress, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, Congress because it was Congress that wholly failed to supervise Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Those two essential institutions, which underpin the United States mortgage market. On the eve of their destruction, Fannie and Freddie had core capital, as defined by their regulator, of $83 billion, and supported around $5.2 trillion of debt and guarantees. In other words they were leveraged 65-to-1. The location of the Congress, I’m sure you’re aware of this but I can’t help but point it out , is Capitol Hill, Washington D.C. And that brings me to another nearby location—the location of the White House. You know the White House played an extremely important role in creating the sub-prime mortgage disaster. “We want everybody in America to own their own home,” declared President George W. Bush, in October in 2002. Everybody, in America. He challenged lenders to create 5.5 million new minority homeowners, by the end of the decade. He signed the American Dream Down Payment Act, in 2003. No Presidential pressure, no sub-prime debacle. The address of the White House, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington D.C. Well, ladies and gentlemen, bankers are nearly always actuated by greed, so, I’m sad to say, are many ordinary people too. But it’s the role of government to strike a balance, between market forces, and stability. And I move in conclusion, that we should blame Washington more than Wall Street, for this crisis. Not least because in my view, Washington sold itself to Wall Street. And I very much fear, is still in hock to it. I beg to propose this motion.",
against,"Thank you, I hope you can all hear me, — I see a lot of green out there tonight, which is fitting on two levels. It’s also St. Patrick’s Day, another festival of wretched excess that will lead to some hangovers tomorrow. And I have to say I’m at a great disadvantage because, Niall Ferguson has that accent, he could read the phone book to you and it would sound a lot smarter than I do. But before I get going I want to quickly address something that Niall said— Niall was talking a lot about institutions that were involved with residential home finance. And there’s no doubt that mortgages, residential mortgages are a huge part of this crisis. But the two banks that have collapsed in the last year, the two Wall Street banks that have effectively collapsed in the last year, Lehman and Bear, really weren’t all that involved in the residential mortgage finance business, they— Not to say they weren’t involved but they weren’t as involved as a lot of other people. And the reason I point that out is because, the issues here, are a lot larger than Fannie and Freddie or the home price bubble, as significant as that is. So let me, let me start by going back to the resolution which, the resolution doesn’t say, we need more regulation going forward, I don’t think anyone on this panel, anyone in this room would disagree with that. And the resolution doesn’t say that bankers should all be put on a desert island and forced to make their own society. You know, I guess that’s the Hamptons but— Sorry, Jim. But— But what the resolution says is, “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” And that is flat wrong. And to understand why, like Niall, I wanna take you back to the Depression, and to the creation of the SEC. Now, the Depression was the last time that there was this kind of public anger at Wall Street and at big business in the United States, and understandably so. And when the Roosevelt administration created the SEC, one of the things that they considered doing, briefly, was having the SEC have the power to prevent companies from selling shares, not because they were committing fraud or misrepresenting their financial statements, but simply because the SEC’s economic experts would find, well, this company doesn’t have very good prospects. This company has too much competition. We’re not gonna let them sell shares. And that idea didn’t go very far, it was very rapidly rejected, but it was considered. But what—why I think this is so important and interesting is it shows that even during the Depression, even during a time when unemployment was 25 percent and there were breadlines and there was really a question about whether capitalism could work, and there—you know, there was an alternative model that seemed to be working in the Soviet Union— Even then the United States went with a relatively permissive, regulatory regime. And that’s always been our history. And to me, that makes sense, and if you think about your own life, if you think about your own business as you know, whether you’re a lawyer or a doctor or whether you work in retail, whether you—a landlord, whatever it is that you may do, you probably have a better idea where the opportunities are, but also where the problems are, where you can take advantage of your customers, where you can cut corners, than any regulator could no matter closely they monitored you. It’s your business, it’s your life. And so the regulator needs to set the rules, but in the end—you succeed or fail on your own. And think about the commercial airline industry in the United States, which is really a great success story in the most important way which is that it’s extremely safe. You can count the number of jet crashes this decade on one hand, in the United States. And, you know, we’re going towards zero. And I don’t think that’s because the FAA is a better regulator than the FDA or the SEC, or anyone else, I think it’s because there’s a commitment in the airline industry to safety. Now whether they define that as a moral issue, we need to protect our passengers and our workers, or whether it’s a practical issue where they believe there might not be economic repercussions, people might not wanna fly if there were too many crashes, I don’t know. But there’s no question that the airline industry in the United States is extremely safe. And I think it’s not a result of the FAA, I think it’s a result of a commitment within the industry. Compare that to Wall Street, which appears to have been run by a bunch of greedy children, for the last 10 years. And greed is a crucial word there, because although Niall sort of—you know, he mentioned the compensation and then skated past it. Compensation is a crucial, crucial part of understanding what went wrong on Wall Street in the last 10 years. When you can make a million or 10 million or in some cases $100 million for a year’s work, you don’t have very much incentive to run your business for the long term. If you can…if theoretically, you’re being paid in stock, and your compensation is gonna be restricted over a long time, you have more incentive. But even so if the numbers are really, really large, it’s unlikely that you’re going to think long-term. And so I think Jim now will talk to you about some of the specifics of what went wrong on Wall Street in the last 10 years. But, at its core, the issue is relatively simple, there was a huge amount of leverage taken, there was inadequate capital to support the risks that the banks were taking. When you make loans, some of them are gonna go bad, and you need to have enough money in capital, in equity, to handle those losses, and the banks simply didn’t have that. Now, did Washington create the conditions that allowed that to happen, sure. Could we and should we have had a much more robust regulatory system?  Regulation is vital, regulation sets the playing field, it sets the rules. But in the end, you have to put blame where blame is due. And, blame is due on the firms. It’s due on the owners, it’s due on the managers, it’s due on the executives, it’s due on the employees. To some extent, although to a lesser extent it’s due on shareholders because the shareholders didn’t properly manage the boards of directors but that’s something Nell can talk about. But in the end, blame accrues to Wall Street, not Washington, please keep that in mind, and vote against this resolution. ",1.0
for,"The British always wanna file me under Steele-Gordon, with a hyphen. I only use my middle name because John Gordon is about as blah a name as you can find. I’m here to argue that Washington is more at fault than Wall Street, although as everybody has admitted, Wall Street has plenty of blame to take here. But…Wall Street is not unitary. Wall Street is nothing but a metonym for the American financial market, and it operates around the globe and…nowadays, deep down into the socioeconomic spectrum. Now some of the people who are encompassed by the term “Wall Street” have fiduciary obligations to their stockholders or to their depositors. But the majority of, of Wall Streeters do not. They are operating entirely for themselves in their self-interest. Washington on the other hand, has nothing but fiduciaries, I mean that’s why governments are instituted among men, no other reason. Now, Wall Street because it is entirely inhabited by people who are pursuing their self-interest, it’s notorious that there are only two emotions to be found on Wall Street, fear and greed. Right now I think it’s perhaps time to put in a good word for greed. As a result, we have had panics on Wall Street roughly every 20 years. Now the Constitution came into effect in April of 1789, we had the first crash on Wall Street in April of 1792. Then we had another one 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, 1987, and now 2008. It seems to be just part of the beast, I mean could any of these panics have been prevented by Wall Street? I doubt it. Being individuals, and Wall Street is nothing but a collection of individuals, not an institution, it is inherently susceptible to the madness of crowds. So, blaming Wall Street is like blaming the atmosphere for thunderstorms, it’s the nature of the beast, it’s going to happen. Washington on the other hand is supposed to be the guys with the striped shirts and the whistles on the playing field. They make up the rules, and then they enforce them. And then they sometimes change the rules in order to accommodate some of their friends. Also Alan Greenspan famously said, that it is—part of the Federal Reserve’s job is to take away the punchbowl when the party really gets going. In other words it’s Washington’s job to prevent the crowd from going mad. They’ve just done an incredibly lousy job of regulating Wall Street or preventing the madness of crowds. I mean for one thing the regulatory apparatus is a total shambles. I mean we have the Federal Reserve, we have the Controller of the Currency, we have the SEC, we have the Office of Thrift Supervision. We have the FDIC. We have the banking regulatory authorities of the 50 states. All of them bureaucracies, all of them devoted as all bureaucrats are to protecting turf, far and head of, of actually regulating anything. Now, also, politicians are subject to human nature, the same as Wall Streets are. If Wall Streeters are in the business of making money, politicians are in the reelection business. That means that they’re gonna be short term-oriented, they’re gonna—what they want is the good headline tomorrow morning, and if that produces dreadful policy two or three or five years out, that’s after the election, we’ll worry about it then. Everybody knows that publicly-traded corporations have to submit annual reports, that these reports have to be according to standardized accounting rules, and that they have to be certified as being honest and complete by independent accountants. This is a great idea. It’s now so obvious that nobody even thinks about it anymore, but it was invented by Wall Street. Because the great Wall Street banks in the late 19th century, they wanted to know what the corporations were really up to, and so did the members of the New York Stock Exchange. So the corporation screamed bloody murder at first, but the Wall Street banks said sorry, if you want us to underwrite your securities, you’re gonna have to do this, and the New York Stock Exchange says if you want your securities listed with us, you’re gonna have to do it, so they finally did it. There’s still one great big player in the financial world in the United States, that is not subject to these commonsense rules. It’s called the government. For instance, you remember those budget surpluses in the later years of the Clinton administration between 1998 and 2001? They amounted to $558 billion. So the national debt went down by $558 billion, right? Uh, no, it went up by $400 billion. The reason is that Social Security was put on budget. And that means that the revenues that flow into Social Security over and above what is paid out to recipients of Social Security becomes part of the government revenue, it’s called an intra-governmental transfer. Of course the money that’s taken out of the Social Security trust fund is replaced with newly minted federal bonds. Which is why the debt went up. Now, if a private company or publicly-traded company, tried to take employee contributions to the company pension fund, and call it revenue in order to perk up the bottom line, the managers of that corporation would all this very minute be playing volleyball in Club Fed. Or, consider Fannie and Freddie. It was a great—Fannie was a great idea, it sounded, in 1938--and it really, it liquefied the mortgage market, it helped, along with the GI Bill tremendously, to increase home ownership, and I’m gonna have to quit here I’m afraid.",1.0
against,"Thank you, John, and thank you to Robert and to Intelligence Squared for putting on this great series and heightening the public debate on these important issues. I think you’re doing great, great work, thank you. Now, we’ve heard from two-thirds of the “for” team’s members, and from my august teammate, Mr. Berenson. And, we all seem to be missing sight of the resolution. Again, no one seems to disagree that more regulation is needed. No one seems to disagree, that crimes, malfeasance, and incompetence, were at work. The question is who’s more to blame. And I hope to be able to make my point, that in fact that’s gonna be pretty easy to point out. Before I got here I was searching the web for instances of Irish wit when it comes to financial markets and money. Now my mother was Mary Catherine Sullivan, and as much as",1.0
for,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I say the beginning I support the proposition, I blame more Washington, than Wall Street for this financial crisis, but I should say the beginning, that I do agree that Wall Streeters, bankers, traders, investors, are greedy. Sometimes they are stupid, they are arrogant, they’re incompetent. They take too much risk, they take too much leverage, they are over compensated, all that’s true. But we’ve had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, we have to ask ourselves, are bankers and investors more greedy and more immoral than they were 20 years ago. 20 years ago, Gordon Gekko in Wall Street said that greed is good. I don’t think that has changed, you know, we know there is always greed, actually greed in some sense is good, is one of the drivers of capitalism. But we know that greed has to be controlled by three things. By fear of losses, by the fact they should not expect to be bailed out, and by a system of prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system because financial markets without ruling institutions are like the law of the jungle. And that’s to me the failure, I expect Wall Street to be greedy but I expect good policy-making, trying to control the behavior, and that did not happen. In many dimensions. The Fed and Greenspan, after the last tech bubble went bust, cut interest rates almost to zero, and created the asset bubble, kept interest rates too low for too long. Was most at that time, people talked about the Greenspan put in financial markets, it was the expectation whenever trouble occurs, Greenspan’s gonna ease things and get you out of your losses and problems. It happened after the 1987 stock market crash and the S&L crisis easing, then in the ‘90s with the tech bubble, Greenspan warned about irrational exuberance and did nothing about it. And after the tech bubble went bust, he cut interest rates from 6.5 down to 1 percent, and he created the latest bubble. So, he has been a creator of serial bubbles one after the other and when people expect to be bailed out then they behave accordingly, that’s the Greenspan truth. We created a system which people expect, that the gains are going to be privatized, and the losses are going to be socialized; this is a welfare state for the rich, for the well-connected and for Wall Street. That’s what happened, that’s public policy. The action of the Fed regarding the asset bubble, was, you don’t do anything on the way up, that was the official rule of Greenspan, Don Kohn, and Ben Bernanke, and when the asset bubble collapses, to avoid the collateral damage to the real economy, you ease aggressively. Again, that’s a buyer’s behavior that creates more and more bubbles. We’re running out of bubbles actually to create, with the real estate bubble, the tech bubble, the hedge fund bubble, the private equity bubble, you know, even the commodity bubble, the art bubble, we’re running out of bubbles to create but we’re easing again down to zero so, what’s gonna happen this time around. As was pointed out, the job of the Fed is to take away the punchbowl when the party gets going but unfortunately not only the Fed did not take away the punchbowl, it added vodka, whiskey, gin, and every toxic stuff to it. And it made the bubble even bigger. Take the role of the Fed and the regulators, with sub-prime mortgages…Greenspan was the biggest cheerleader of this kind of financial innovation. Zero down payment, no verification of income, assets and jobs, they called them ninja loans or liar loans. Interest-only mortgages, negative amortization, teaser rates, all this toxic stuff or sub-prime, near-prime, prime. The Fed and Greenspan actively said was the best thing that have happened to mortgages. Free market, they could control it, they had the law, the power to do it, they didn’t do it. Think about our public policy towards housing and mortgages. The Community Reinvestment Act, creation of Fannie and Freddie-subsidized housing. The 20 ways in which we have subsidized, through tax policy, interested community of mortgages. The worst, and the most unproductive form of investment, investment in housing. Big McMansion can give you utility but doesn’t increase the stock of capital in the real way of productivity of capital and labor, like, physical capital does. We have subsidized housing in 20 different ways. That has led to the bubble as well. There was an ideology for the last decade in Washington, that was critical to this financial crisis. Was an ideology of laissez-faire, Wild West unregulated capitalists. The base of this ideology was the idea that banks and financial institutions will self-regulate. And as we know, self-regulation means no regulation. It was the ideology of relying on market discipline, and we know when there is irrational exuberance, there is zero market discipline. There was an ideology, and policies of relying on an internal risk-management model and as was pointed out, Chuck Prince said, when the music is playing you gotta stand up and dance, nobody listens in good times to the risk managers, they’re the party poopers, only the risk takers have the advantage in the banks, and therefore, relying on internal risk management doesn’t work. Was relying on rating agencies that had massive conflicts of interest because of being paid by those they are supposed to be rating. And this rating agency had a quasi-governmental role. They had monopoly or oligopoly power, and power to decide whose assets you can buy or not buy, that was policy that led them to have that power, and those kind of distortions. So every element of our regulatory system, has failed, you know, this Basel accord that relied on this principle, has failed even before it was implemented. Relying on principle rather than rules, relying on light touch, rather than tough rules, a light touch means no touch at all. The ideology of Greenspan was, every financial innovation is great, markets self-regulate. Shareholders are gonna be able to control the behavior of bankers and so on. This was the belief in deregulation. Elements of it, actions were taken. The repeal of Glass-Steagall that separated investment banking from commercial banking. Now we let them essentially, use deposit insurance and deposits to do 30 times leverage prop trading, that’s what was allowed. Essentially deregulation of credit derivatives and derivatives, over the counter with systemic risk. Things of that sort were going on. The SEC deciding the level ratios, 30 to 1 was okay. Those were the policy that led then to those excesses. There is greed, it is up to public policy to make sure that greed is controlled because otherwise if you don’t have rules, institutions, and balance and prudential regulation supervision, is the law of the jungle, and unfortunately the last element of it was regulatory capture. It was an ideology in which, the government power taken over and controlled by lobbies where those were pushing for this kind of deregulation. So it was a massive failure of public policy, thank you.",1.0
against,"Only when they deserve it. You’ve got to vote for our side. I have to tell you, you know, there’s plenty of blame to go around, we all agree, there’s plenty of blame to go around. You know, there’s Washington, there’s Wall Street, but all of us know who really is to blame here, it’s gotta be Jim Cramer. Listen, I’m willing to blame everybody, I’m even willing to blame that Bachelor guy, I— everybody, everybody deserves— it takes a village to create this problem. Or put it another way I’m gonna quote Pogo, who said, “We have met the enemy and he is us,” every one of us bears some responsibility for what went on here but I’m gonna tell you today, why it’s Wall Street that is primarily responsible. First of all, it’s a bit of a false distinction, between Wall Street and Washington. And one of the things I’m going to talk about today is how inextricably they are linked. We talk about Fannie and Freddie. Those were public corporations, after all. They were a little bit the better, the worst of both worlds, a little bit of a duck billed platypus because they had a little government edge there. But those were public corporations with Boards of Directors and they behaved like public corporations. They behaved badly. And that is what is wrong with Wall Street. So you may noticed already, even in this few minutes that I’ve been up here, I’m different. I’m not like anybody else on this panel and that is why, and the primary difference, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, is I’m the only one on the panel who is from Washington. I have to say, none of these people know anything about Washington except some addresses. That’s all we know. I see he’s got a GPS, is all he’s got. And you know, and the other thing is, I’m not an economist. I am a capitalist. I, uniquely on this panel, I have created businesses. I have created businesses, had them grow and sold them. I have worried about making a payroll. So I know something. I’m not like an economist who, it works in theory, it doesn’t work in practice. So I know what it is to be a capitalist. And I know what it is to be a bureaucrat. I worked in the government. In the Reagan administration I was at OMB. And let me tell you, one of the big shocks in my life was all these people who espouse and rhapsodize about the free market kept trooping over to me to get me to give them limits on liability and erect barriers to entry. Everybody is all about the free market except when it benefits them not to be. So I’m going to tell you the three things that Wall Street did that are unforgivable and that really weigh the balance in favor of their responsibility. What is the one thing we want from Wall Street? We want just one thing. We want them to be able to do math, right? The math was wrong. Their math was bad. They put too much reliance on something called the Gaussian copula formula. Yes, the Gaussian copula formula is at the heart of what created the derivative securities, the credit default swaps. They all relied on it. They all got on one leaky little boat. They didn’t take out their slide rules. They didn’t do the math. So they relied on bad statistics. They left out one big variable. Yes, they heard music, but what dance were they doing? They heard music for the minuet. They were doing the boogie, okay? And what is the address of all of those forms? I believe it’s on Wall Street. Second thing, bad incentives. They were getting paid based on the quantity of transactions, not the quality of transactions. Now, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that’s going to have a very bad result. Look at what we’ve seen about the pay just in the last couple of days. Look at The New York Post with its headline today: AIG Is a P-I-G. These people were getting paid regardless of what happened. You heard about Anthony Mozilo? Six hundred million dollars as he took the stock down seventy-eight per cent and took the economy down with it. Fuld didn’t have to give any of it back. I testified with Fuld before Congress in Washington when they called him in to account. And he said, up until last year the performance was pretty good. So he should be allowed to keep all that money. Only thirteen percent of companies on Wall Street have claw backs, meaning they have to give back the money when the numbers that were reported, that they got their bonuses on, turn out to be wrong. That is on Wall Street. What are they doing now? Watch them carefully. They are repricing their options. That is disgusting. And that is Wall Street. Okay, next. Terrible oversight as shareholders. Yes, the shareholders should have done more. Guess who the big shareholders are? Yeah, they’re on Wall Street. Who was it that was voting in favor of these insane pay packages? Well, look at the firms on Wall Street. They’re the big shareholders. They’re managing all that money. They are enablers for the addiction of bad pay packages on Wall Street. And yeah, Washington behaved badly. Washington behaved very badly. Do you think the fact that from 1998 to 2008 over six hundred million dollars was spent on lobbying to get rid of regulations, like Glass-Steagall, to get rid of capital requirements on banks – do you think maybe that might have had an effect on it? Yeah, Washington is nice to its friends. Who is responsible for that? Who are its friends? I would like Wall Street to make the same disclaimer that is required of mutual funds. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. And who is it that requires them to say that? That is Washington. Wall Street has expected us to bet on them for a long time. They have not lived up to our trust in them and they are more responsible than Washington for this mess. ",1.0

Now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here. But they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis. You don’t have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated. That country is called Canada. So if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States. And that is our central point.

I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious. Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse. So, no, I’m not in favor of more regulation. The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign. The trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess. This, I think, is the point that John Steele Gordon, Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress. And it’s not difficult, if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world, to see why the U.S. was so bad.",2.0

for,"But you understate the case. think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis. You know, after the Great Depression we imposed a system of strong regulations of the financial system, capital controls and for a few decades there were not that many financial crises and banking crises. It’s not just the U.S. If you look around, for the last twenty years, you have had financial crises and banking crises and so on in a number of countries. And what has been changing over the last twenty years, starting with Ronald Reagan and then Margaret Thatcher, the ideology became of deregulation at any cost, first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets. Now, some deregulation was good. Nobody is in favor of excess. Even probably we swang the balance too much in the direction of too much regulation after the Great Depression and that led to not enough financial innovation. But deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises, like in East Asia, like in Mexico, like in Argentina and so on. And therefore, there is a strong correlation between the quality of the regulatory and supervisory regime and whether financial crisis occurs. There’s a trade off between the two, but that’s what’s really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation, low inflation and growth, these financial crises are occurring now more frequently.

Firms, you know, Wall Street was essentially a set of partnerships, largely, until the Seventies and by the Nineties, I think, Goldman was the last big firm to give up the partnership model. So, again, it’s not your capital at risk anymore. It’s your shareholders’ capital at risk. You don’t own your firm anymore, you own a portion of it. I don’t think it’s an accident that there are some small partnerships out there that have essentially thri -- Well, thrive may be too strong a word. But they have survived this crisis. The other very, very important change, really the most important change, is the egregious increase in compensation. It’s one thing if you’re making five hundred thousand dollars a year. Let’s say you’re making some multiple of an average American’s salary, where if you do that for ten years, you’re, you know, you’re very well off. It’s another thing if one good year makes your life and makes your children’s lives. It really skews your incentives. You know what? Washington has its own market system.

And then there’s another group where, anything goes. And you can make or lose whatever you want, you can pay your employees whatever you want, but if you go under, you are not getting one dime and that is the explicit charter that you’re operating under. And the difficulty is figuring out how those two systems would interface. But if you could do that, then, hopefully we could avoid this problem in the future.",2.0
for,"There is a regulatory capture in almost every industry, the lobbyists take over the regulators and change things into their own interest. But there’s only one industry, the financial industry, in which this thing leads, over and over again, to financial crisis, banking crisis. They’re a disaster, they cost trillions of dollars. And ask yourself what happens, and why that happens. It happens for two reasons. One because banks have deposit insurance and deposit guarantees. Should we take some of the asset people money, you leverage like crazy, do crazy things. If you gain it’s your money, otherwise it’s the taxpayer. Two, we have lender of last resort support. When banks get in trouble the Fed comes to the rescue, and it’s a variant of this moral hazard of the bailout. And that’s why these banking crises occur over and over and over again, and they’re becoming more disrupting, more expensive and so on. That has to do key, with exactly our regulatory system, there is something wrong about it and if we don’t fix it these things are gonna happen, and the costs are gonna come even bigger, again, people are greedy in every industry, people in every industry try to avoid regulation sometimes with lies, sometimes by cheating or avoiding, whatever. That’s human nature, why it leads to disaster in financial industry, because we have the system. This isn’t— This isn’t rocket science. One set of people under discussion, owes a duty to the public interest. Those are the politicians and regulators. That is why we call them public servants. And the other group, let us take the investment bankers, because of course, Wall Street is composed of many different institutions, but let’s take the investment bankers. They owe a duty, to their shareholders, and also to bondholders. Now it’s quite interesting though the point hasn’t been made yet, that to all of these investment banks performed equally badly. The fate of Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers illustrates that egregious bad management can achieve. But the performance of Goldman Sachs was really significantly different. Goldman actually didn’t lose substantial amounts of money, though its shareholders have certainly taken some punishment. And the punishment has been meted out by the market, to the people who invested in those banks. They will almost certainly end up with nothing, I’m fairly clear, that those people who invested in financial securities will end up with very little indeed.

What are the two things they requested, from Washington, following this stunning collapse almost out of the blue of one of our major brokerage firms. Was it tightened regulatory surveillance, was it more regulators on the trading desk, was it something like that, no. They asked for two things. They asked for short selling to be stopped, or curtailed, and they asked for a loosening in the accounting rules. And on both cases, one was done, and changed, the other’s under consideration now.

Now its debts at the time in terms of funded debt were $150 billion, stay with me on this, numbers are important when it comes to Wall Street. So, 90 cents off on that dollar bill means the debt was impaired by $135 billion. Lehman bonds still trade around 10 to 15 cents on the dollar, six months later. There’s $20 billion in equity at the time, that tells us that the hole in Lehman’s balance sheet was roughly $150 to $160 billion. To put that in perspective the hole in Enron when the dust cleared, roughly was $60 to $70 billion. Lehman was twice as bad as Enron.
