for," Well, I guess that would be Barack Obama. Of course, he was president even then -- president of the Harvard Law Review. We had very productive and pleasant interchanges. And I still have a lot of residual fondness from those days. This is Carrie Severino.  John Donva n:You are chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network. That's where you focus on judicial issues like constitutional limits on government and the federal nomination process. You've had briefs filed before the Supreme Court. You testified before Congress. Your group actually took a strong position when Justice Scalia passed away on how to fill that vacant seat. You argued that people should decide -- that the people should decide by how they vote for president in November of 2016. Question, is that a political argument you're making or is it a constitutional argument? Well, our main driver is constitutional. First, that we have a justice who is going to be faithful to the constitution and the laws. Bu t second, that we really need to defend the Senate's right to exercise their advice and consent given to them by the Constitution as they see fit. They don't have to be a rubber -stamp for the Congress. I expect we'll get a chance to talk a little more abou t advice and consent."
against," My good friend and former colleague Eric Posner. Tyrannophobia is the unreasoning fear that the president at any moment will become a dictator. And I wanted to mention to you, John, that I was gratified to see recently that a medical diagnostics website has listed tyrannophob ia as a real condition. Dizziness, nausea, and a propensity for saying that the president has violated constitutional powers."
for,"""The biggest problem s that we're facing right now has to do with our president trying to bring more power into the executive bra nch and not go through Congress at all."" Those aren't my words, though. Those are the words of then- candidate Barack Obama in 2008. He pledged, ""That's what I intend to reverse when I'm President of the United States of America."" Well, has he? My collea gue and I agree that Obama was right, President Bush did, in many ways, usurp the power of Congress as president. Unfortunately, President Obama continued in his footsteps, and his -- their successors show many signs of going in the same direction of tryi ng to aggrandize presidential power. We believe tonight that our position actually the easy one to prove. Perhaps you agree with us that when any branch of the government transgresses the Constitutional bounds set before it, that it puts the foundations of our liberty at risk. But maybe you think Congress has -- already has too much power under the Constitution, and the president actually should have some more flexibility and freedom of action. Maybe you think thatachieving his goals might be worth breaking a few rules now and then. But if you acknowledge that he has taken actions, whether you think they're good or bad, that the institution actually assigns to Congress and not the president, then you must vote ""Yes"" on tonight's propositio n, the president has usurped the powers of Congress. To usurp means to take power that doesn't belong to you. So under the Constitution, what powers do belong to the president? The president has the power to execute the law, but he cannot make law. He can't amend law, and he cannot repeal the law. Only the Congress has power to do that. He cannot spend money without congressional appropriation, and he cannot start a war. That's for Congress. He also can't make major appointments without confirmation by the Senate, and he can't sign a treaty without a two -thirds vote of the Senate. Unfortunately, many presidents have overreached these areas. We certainly don't say President Obama's the first one to do so, and unfortunately, he will not be the last. But because tonight's problem is really referring to the current president, we are going to have to talk about him in some specifics. So we're going to divide up where my -- my friend here, Michael, will focus on the international agreement -- arena. He's going to talk about immigration, national security, war, and treaties. I'll focus on the domestic side, on the president's appointment power, his expenditure of money not appropriated by Congress, and his unilateral rewriting of some laws. I'm going to start with what I think is the most open -and -shut case, and that is an appointment. As I said, high -level appointments need to have confirmation by the Senate. But there is an exception during recesses. The Senate -- the president may mak e recess appointments. But not any old recess will do. Super short recesses like, you know, we're taking a break for lunch, the president can't just throw in a bunch of nominees and call it good. And out of the thousands of recess appointments through the history of this country, none of them has been made in the way that President Obama did. In December 2011, the Senate knew he wanted to push through some controversial nominees that they weren't going to confirm, so they purposely did not go into a big break over Christmas break as they normally do on Decemb er 17th. They said, we're going into sessions every three days purposely and explicitly to block the president's recess appointment power. But the president said, ""It doesn't matter. I'm going to do it anyway."" He tried -- he put four nominees on and s aid he was recess appointing them when the Senate said it wasn't in recess. His excuse was, ""I refuse to take no for an answer."" That's hardly Constitutional reasoning. And unfortunately for him, ""No"" is exactly what the Supreme Court said. They said that unanimously. Every single justice, the conservatives, the liberals, the justices the president himself had put on the court agreed that he had usurped the powers in Congress. I hope you will agree as well. Another example of abuse comes up in the context of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamac are. On 43 different occasions now, this administration has rewritten or ignored deadlines, fines, taxes, and other provisions of the statute because the y wanted to ignore or postpone some of the politically painful parts of the law. People like the good stuff, but they don't want to have to pay for it, right? But the only reason the administration has gotten away with this so far because the court says the House of Representatives doesn' t have standing to bring this argument. So basically, they've gotten off on a technicality so far. A final egregious example has to do with this administration's bailout of insurance companies that if you're suffer ing huge losses under Obamac are, and the administration asks Congress for an appropriation to help pay them back for some of the money they've been required by that law to pay out, and Congress explicitly refused to do that. But the administration brazenly decided to spend $7 billion of your taxpayers money on that anyway. When a DC circuit court heard the case, they just recently came down with a decision that said that the administration had blatantly violated the appropriations power. The Constitution could not be clearer on this. No money may be drawn from the treasury. But in consequence, appropriations made by law, period. And it turns out, as the New York Times just uncovered, that the legal team from the IRS had already told the president he didn't have authority to do this. That is brazenly usurping the power of Congress. You're going to hear about a lot of different cases and laws tonight, but don't forget that behind the discussion there is a vital principle, and that's that the structure of our Constitution is what preserves our liberty. It's what gives us a country whe re we have the prosperity, the civil society that our framework intended. That structural Constitution is worth fighting for. If, after listening to our debate, you agree that on any one of these ar eas that Michael and I will talk about tonight, the president has usurped powers that the Constitution gives to Congress, you should vote ""Yes"" on the proposition tonight. "
against," Eric and I, we're here this evening to ask for your vote against the proposition that the president has usurped Congress' Constitutional power. And we're going to talk about a lot of different specific issues over the co urse of the next hour. But in the opening, I'll talk mostly about domestic issues and Eric will talk mostly about foreign affairs issues. I guess I want to start where Carrie left off, with the importance of Constitutional structure because I think there 's a point about which we all agree, certainly everyone on the stage and probably all of you in the audience, which is that the president is in fact a very important policy maker in modern government. That's not really what the question is tonight. The question is how we evaluate the power that the president wields. And that the motion on the table suggests that the president holds the power he holds because he's stolen it, unconstitutionally from Congress, right, in a power grab. A usurper is someone who seizes force, as Carrie noted, illegally, often -- often by force through seizing power. And the question tonight is why the president has the power he possesses. Now, the reality is that the president possesses power today not because he s eized it by force, but instead because over the course of the 20th century, Congress has lawfully delegated to the president power to solve important and complicated social problems. Over the course of the 20th century, people began to demand more from their governments. We went through a nationalization and a globalization of our economy. We went through a Great Depression, a new deal, a couple of world wars, a civil rights revolution, and people demanded that the national government solve more and more complicated problems. Congress quickly realized that it couldn't solve all those problems on its own. It didn't have the capacity or the expertise to decide, say, what the right level of sulphur dioxide emission was for trucks on US highways, or what the right way was to regulate Wall Street derivatives, to make sure that we don't have another financial calamity. And so, in statute after statute, Congress delegated power to the executive branch, to administrative agencies, and to the presiden t, to come up with solutions to these problems. Now, over the course of the 20th century, that did amount to a kind of Constitutional revolution, and it's made the president an important policy maker. And it does mean that the system we have today is really not the system that our foundersimagined, and probably would have been one that they wouldn't have liked. But the system they imagined, the system that worked for our agrarian economy in the 19th century isn't sufficient to tackle the problems we hav e today. Now, let me get me concrete. Let me talk about a couple of issue areas. So one of the most prominent arenas in which the president's been criticized is immigration policy. But the most important fact that I can tell you guys tonight about immigration policy is this: There are 22 million noncitizens who live in the country. 11 million of them are out of status. They're unauthorized. They're not here lawfully. That means half of the legal subjects who are regulated by immigration law are in violation of the law. That means that Congress asked the president essentially to do the impossible. To enforce the law fully, the president would have to deport 11 million people. But this president, President Obama, while he's deported more every year than any preceding president, has still managed to deport just 400,000 each year. That's a large number, but it's only 3 percent of the unauthorized population. That means inevitably the president has to pick and choose, has to decide where e nforcement resources will be prioritized and where they'll be deprioritized. And so the -- the signature immigration initiatives that President Obama announced, the decision not to prioritize the removal of so -called dreamers, right, immigrant s who arrived as children, or the parents of US citizens, that was just a way of bringing transparency and equality to a set of decision that's the president wasn't just empowered to make by Congress but was in fact obligated to make in order to enforce the law. Now, that doesn't mean that presidents have unlimited power because, of course, what Congress gives, Congress can take away. And Congress sets up the framewo rk within which the president must operate. Also it means that inevitably there will be d isagreements about what those framework rules mean. All of us who have kids know that whenever there are rules there are disagreements about what those rules mean. And sometimes the president's interpretation of those rules succeeds in the court. So with the Affordable Care Act, for example, one of the most high profile debates, one of the most high profile debates was about whether tax credits could be given to people who purchased health insurance on the federal exchanges instead of the state exchang es. The law was maybe confused on this point. There was striking disagreement among lawyers. But the Supreme Court sided with the president. But even when the president doesn't win at the court, even those losses, when a judge decides that the administration's interpretation of those rules that Congress sets toguide the president's exercise of power don't permit something that the administration has done, that's not a sign of usurpation, as Carrie suggested, it's actually a sign of legal compliance of courts because it's just more evidence that the president is, in fact, bound by these legal rules that Congress establishes. And for that reason Eric and I urge you to vote against the motion."
for,"Thank you, John. In preparation for this debate, I read Eric Posner's very interesting book on presidential power. And now I've heard Adam Cox. They seem to be coming at us from opposite directions. Adam Cox thinks everything the president has done is totally legal, authorized by broad delegations by Congress. In contrast, Eric Posner thinks that the very idea that the executives should be limited by laws is now, quote, ""obsolete."" In this book he identifies what he calls, ""multiple examples,"" in which the executive I'm quoting now -- the executive proceeded with dubious legal authority or simply ignored the laws and got away with it. In fact, he thinks the executive is now unbound by law. That's the title of his book, ""The Executive Unbound."" Now, Carrie and I agree with Eric Posner that the executive has frequently acted without legal authority. That in itself demands an affirmative vote o n tonight's resolution. The framers of our Constitution knew the dangers of an executive unbound and attempted to protect us, their posterity, through a written constitution limiting that executive's powers. Unfortunately, recent presidents and especially Bush and Obama have systematically breached those limits. Let me get down to some specifics, beginning with immigration. Now, as Adam Cox just explained, President Obama recently issued an order unilaterally giving -- he didn't mention this, though -- giving lawful status to some four million of those aliens who are here in violation of the law. Now, that doesn't mean not deporting them. That isn't just not prioritizing someone else. The actual terms of the order was to give them lawful st atus which includes the right to work, to sign up for Social Security, and to receive numerous other benefits. Now, obviously, Adam thinks this is good public policy. And he may very well be right about that. But it's hard to take seriously the idea tha t this is just routine enforcement discretion. For one thing, President Obama himself said just the opposite repeatedly when advocates were asking him to issue such an order. For example, on March 28, 2011, President Obama said, and I quote, ""With respec t to the notion that I can just suspend deportation through executive order, that's just not the case because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed. For me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president."" Well, appropriate or not, Obama did it anyway. But here's what's interesting. Even after he signed the order, Obama did not claim he was just exercising discretion under the law or prioritizing. He candidly stated, and again I quote, ""What you're not paying attention to is I just took an action to chang e the law."" Well, if you were paying attention when Carrie listed the various powers of the Constitution vests in Congress and not in the preside nt, that was one of them. He cannot change the law. Only Congress can do that. But what matters about this is that if Obama can change this law, a future president can use so -called enforcement discretion to dispense with laws he or she doesn' t like of any note -- of any sort. Tax laws, or trade laws, or laws about ethics in government. Eric Posner just wrote in the New York Times a few days ago Donald Trump as president could refuse to enforce environmental regulations -- and I'm quoting Eric here – “ just as Mr. Obama refused to enforce immigration laws.  Now, I don't think we have much disagreement up here that Presidents Bush and Obama both have usurped power in the national security arena. I just quote Eric Posner from h is book. I love this book. And Donald Trump will love it even more. It'll be huge. Quote, ""The Obama Administration has followed Bush Administration policies on national security with the single exception of tor ture, including the reliance on broad surveillance powers, detention, military commissions, rendition, and targeted assassinations."" He calls all these policies questionable under the law. Carrie and I agree. So should you.  Under both the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, Congress -- not the president -- has the responsibility to decide on whether to start a war. But President Obama, on the urging of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, took us into a war to topple the regime of Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi without even attempting to get authorization from Congress. According to the New York Times, June 18th, 2011, quote, ""President Obama rejected the views of the top lawyers at the Pentagon and the Justice Department when he dec ided that he had the legal authority to continue American military participation in the air war in Libya without congressional authorization. What will future presidents do with these expansive powers? Well, we don't know. It really depends on what the people decide, not just in November, but even here tonight. That's why this debate is so important, because the first step is to admit that there is a problem.  Recent presidents have usurped the powers of Congress. If we're not willing to say even that, we deserve what we get."
against,"My book, which Michael just endorsed – -- is actually quite consistent with Adam's opening statement. The book makes the point that Adam made as well, that our system has evolved a great deal. The original separation of powers scheme that Madison and other founders envisioned has changed a great deal. But that is because the world has changed. The United States has changed, and people demand more from the national government than they used to. I want to focus on, as Adam said, international relations. And let me hit a few of the most important issues that the critics of the Obama Administration have raised. So, first, a number of people -- and perhaps Michael -- he didn't explicitly mention this -- argues that the counter -terrorism operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries are a violation of the president's constitutional powers, a usurpation of powers of Congress. However, all of these activitie s have authorization. There was, first of all, the authorization for use of military force, which Congress enacted in 2001, immediately after 9/11. This AUMF, as it's called, gave the president very broad authority to engage in counter -terrorism operations against Al -Qaeda, Al- Qaeda affiliates, nations that harbor Al-Qaeda, and related entities. The second AUMF in 2002 authorized the invasion of Iraq. That AUMF continues to be operative, like the first one, and authorizes combat operations in Iraq and in Syria to the extent that there have been spillover. And then finally, and most important, the president has in the constitution two sources of power that are relevant here. The first is the Commander- in-Chief power, and the second is what lawyers called the ""vesting clause,"" under which the executive power is vested in the president. It is widely agreed among lawyers that these two powers give the presi dent the power to use military force abroad in limited ways to protect American interests, to adv ance American security. Presidents throughout history have relied on these -- on this source of power for military operations overseas. Michael did mention the Libya operation in 2011. This operation was not authorized by Congress, as he mentions. In this case, the president relied on his Constitutional powers. And in doing so, he followed in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Clinton, for example, used military force without congressional authorization in 1999 in Serbia. He also did in Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998 and in Bosnia in 1993. President George H.W. Bush used military force without congressional authorization in Somalia in 1991 and in Panama in 1989. For Reagan, it was Libya in 1986, Grenada in 1983, and Lebanon i n 1982. And these are only the most recent examples. Truman, for example, initiated the Korean War without congressional authorization, instead relying on hisConstitutional powers. My next example are the drone operations which Michael alluded to, he didn't refer to specifically. But a number of people have argued that President Obama has exceeded his Constitutional authority by using drones to engage in targeted killings, including of an American citizen, actually a few American citizens, but one in particular, Anwar al- Awlaki who was targeted. But once you grant that the president has military authority as a result of his Constitutional and statutory powers, it follows that he can use drones just the way he can use piloted aircrafts to launch military strikes. The American citizenship of Awlaki is legally relevant. It's often been the case that Americans in prior wars have gone overseas to join enemy forces. And when that happens, they lose the due process protections that one normally enjoys when one is on American soil. A nd then let me finish with two executive agreements that President Obama entered into. These agreements have received a great deal of attention, and again, people have criticized him for violating the Constitution. So the first such agreemen t was in 2015. It was the Iran nuclear deal. And the second agreement was in 2016, and that was the Paris climate agreement. And so what the critics say is that a president can enter into an international agreement only with two -thirds consent of the Se nate because, in the Constitution, there is a clause called ""The treaty clause,"" which says that when the president enters into a treaty he needs the consent of the Senate. However, there's a difference between a treaty and between the type of agreement t hat President Obama entered into. This type of agreement lawyers usually call an executive agreement or a political agreement. Now, in the case of a treaty, normally, a treaty will directly affect the rights and obligations of Americans or lead to direct legal commandment to an entity in the American government requiring it to do one thing or another. But in the case of these agreements, all that President Obama did was agree to use authorities that he had already has as a result of a statute. So in the case of the Iran nuclear agreement, he was required to raise sanctions against Iran under certain conditions. But there are plenty of statutes that allow him to do that, including the comprehensive Iran sanctions accountability investment act o f 2010. And in the case of the Paris climate agreement, what he agreed to do was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Well, he has the authority to do that under the Clean Air Act, which, as the Supreme Court has recognized, allows him to issue regulation s related to climate change. And to the extent that he needs additional authority under those agreements, he has to go to Congress as he has recognized. So the president has, in allthese cases, acting with authority that he gets from the Constitution or from Congress, and therefore you should vote against the motion."
for,"What it -- this language was specifically adopted by the framers here in Philadelphia in order to negate the possibility that our executive would do what the Stewart kings had done, which was to make pr oclamations declaring lawful things that parliament had made unlawful. This doesn't mean exercise as a prose cutorial discretion. Everyone has always understood that no law is always enforced against everyone. But it does prevent the presiden t from doing what President Obama did in the immigration context, which is actually declaring that activities of some people are lawful even though Congress made them unlawful. So it's faithful -- faithful execution does not mean a hundred percent execution, but it does mean not declaring things lawful that are unlawful."
against,"So I don't think that Mike and I disagree all that much at an abstract level about what that obligation in the Constit ution requires of presidents. It was designed to prevent the dispensing -- the so -called dispensing power from being executed. But it was understood by the framers and has been understood over thecourse of American history that, of course, one of the most important functions in executive play is to exercise discretion in how the law is enforced. Now, on the example of immigration in particular, I guess I just disagree with Michael on the facts. So, you know, the office of legal counsel an d the justice department and the solicito r general of the United States, Don Verrilli, when speaking to the Supreme Court about the immigration case just a month and a half ago, they both stated clearly the same thing that the Department of Homeland Securi ty that issued this order said which was that it does not confer legal status on immigrants. A -- M ichael McConnell: ( unintelligible) legal status is actually in the order? No, it did not. It does say that it confers a technical regulato ry -- M ichael McConnell: The word ""technical"" isn't in there. The word ""Lawful status"" is there and -- No. M ichael McConnell: it enables -- this enables the beneficiaries not just not to be deported. They were give n a laminated photo ID which entitles them to be present in the United States, to get jobs in the United States, to sign up for social security, get earned income tax credits, get drivers licenses. But the law explicitly gives the president the authority to allow people who remain here to work. Yeah, people who are in the country unlawfully --"
for," I think the clearest parallel that we can tell people that talked about this is that we know that you've been driving, you know, five miles over the speed limit, you might not get pulled over. But, if you do get pulled over and they let you off, that's also discretion, right? But it's different than if they give you a card -- a laminated card that says, ""You can't pull me over,"" or, ""If you pull me over, you have to let me off."" That is -- that is a much closer parallel to what's going on here. That changes the law effectively for these people as op posed to just saying, ""Oh, you got lucky this time,"" which is what --we know practically speaking has happened for 11 million people and that's what's really --"
against,But Congress has explicitly said that the president may give work authorization to these people. That is in the statute. There is no statute that says that the president -- that police or the mayor can give a card to people allowing them to speed. There is -- there is no -- there is no analogous provision in any sense.
for,"Well, there are a lot of debates about the amount of delegation we can give to administrative agencies, et cetera, but that actually doesn't come into play in the examples that we were talking about here that I gave earlier. And he talked also about how, you kno w, the King vs. Burwell case, the difficulty in interpreting what, ""an exchange established by the state,"" means. I'm talking about clear examples where the law says, ""This law is going to come into effect on such and such date,"" and the date has been actually changed, or the --"
against,"No, it's often true that Congress includes statutory deadlines in the way it imagines that a law will be rolled out. In the case of Obamacare, as the law was rolled out the administration realized that there were complexities that made it difficult to impose some of the time constraints that Congress had put into the statute. Now, it turns out -- So the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, which provides for national exchanges and in theory affordable health care for all, rolled out over a period of a couple of years. And, as Carrie says, the statute include d a number of targets. Times when certain parts of the law were intended to go online. Now, not all the parts of the law actually went online at that time. And it is, in fact, very common with respect to the Clean Air Act, with respect to the workplac e safety laws. Going back decades, almost every time thatCongress enacts a large ambitious social program, the administration has taken longer to roll that law out than Congress had initially anticipated ."
for,"Yeah, but he -- and he didn't even just move the law, that one -- once, he moved it three times. And that is just to give the broad picture. There's not enough time. There's -- 15 times he changed deadlines in the statute, seven different provisions that he had given up subsidies that weren't authorized, you know, seven different progra ms he invented new waivers for. It says, ""These territories aren't covered --"" There's so many ways he's changed this law, it's almost hard to count. If we had elected Mitt Romney last time around and Romney had suddenly decided that the employer mandate doesn't have to be enforced, the individual mandate doesn't have to be enforced, we're going to have a whole bunch of new waivers that weren't inthis, people would be screaming bloody murder. They would realize that the Congress passed this law, it has to be enforced. Just because President Obama was in favor of the law doesn't give him the right to come back and, yo u know, concoct all of these exceptions in order to try to make it less politically palatable when it comes to enforcement."
against,"Yeah, I mean, the problem is that the other side here is taking this 18th century conceptio n and trying to impress it on the 21st century. What's going here is the Congress produces these massive statutes, hundreds of pages long, which are supposed to solve very difficult social problems. These statutes will have dozens of deadlines in them, sometimes even hundreds of deadlines in them. Dodd -Frank Act had something like 220 deadlines or regulations that were required. And Congress is guessing, you know, it ’s saying, ""Well, you know, this is what we would like you to do. Please try to do i t."" And the -- and presidents of all type, from both parties, they implement these incredibly complex programs. Sometimes they hit deadlines. Sometimes they miss deadlines. Sometimes they adjust things because they don't work properly.  Now, you have to use common sense when you evaluate the president. If the president is trying to advance the goal of the statute, then he's clearly not usurping Congress's power. He's simply acting with more information in light of changing events, in a way that Congress could not anticipate. The problem with the Mitt Romney example is it merely brings into mind somebody who would deliberately subvert the statute. If a president deliberately subverts a statute by ignoring deadlines or whatever it is that are actually essential to the operation of the statute, then at that point you can say, perhaps, that the president is usurping Congress's power. I cannot think of a real example where that's happened in recent history because presidents are re latively conscientious about rolling out the statutes-- I should be able to defend myself. So, let's take two quick points. Immigration law. Congress passes a law, deport 11 million people. Congress passes another law. ""Here's the money to deport 400,000 people."" These laws are at a contradiction. The president has to figure out what to do. What he does is he makes priorities, which is what the president's supposed to do. Second point, President Reagan comes into office on a deregulatory agenda, a deregulatory political agenda to use Michael's word. First thing he does is he issues an executive order, 12 -291, which says that all agencies should do cost benefit tests when issuing regulations. This will have the natural effect of limiting the number of regulations that the agencies will issue. And in addition, he cut bac k on antitrust law and other types of enforcement. Now, what was going on here is that the president was using delegated policy -making authority that he had received from Congress over the decades. He was doing that legitimately because Congress had give n him the discretion to do those things.John Donvan: All right. I want to go to questions. There are a few other things we have not gotten to, the matter of recess appointments, the matter of making war. If any of your questions want to go to that, I would be extremely grateful, but you might also have your own idea. So if you'd raise your hands, again, I need you to ask a very terse question. I'm going to be pretty tough about that. Make it a question that comes down to about 30 seconds. And I'll come -- I'll start right down here. And if you stand up, a microphone will be brought to you. And if you can tell us your name."
for,"Yes, that's -- that is the effect. But actually, that's part of the intent of the Constitutional design, that the president isn't given just a broad authority. The Congress certainly knows how to give that flexibility and some of this delegation to administrative agencies i s how they deal with it. If they think there is going to be an issue that's going to need some tweaking, they can m ake a broader language within limits. But that's not how our Constitution sets it up. It doesn't h ave an escape clause for if the law turns out it's not working a s intended or if the law turns out that people don't like it as well as theythought or there's just speed bumps, as you said. It simply isn't the Constitutional system."
against," I agree completely. And that's exactly why Congress in the 1930s started to give more power to the president and that's why the Supreme Court in an unbroken string of precedents over the last 80 -odd years h as supported that vision of the Constitution. C ongress passes statutes that say things like, ""Clean up the air to protect public health,"" or ""Regulate communications in the public interest."" That's the standard given, and it confers tremendous policy -making authority which makes for a more flexible, responsive policy -making process, a more democratic one."
for,"The administration has taken the interes ting position that the war against ISIS is authorized by the AUMF, the authorization for use of military force that George Bush was given by Congress to fight al -Qaeda on the theory that ISIS, even though it's a competitor and in some ways an enemy of ISIS is in fact an offshoot of ISIS. You know, President Obama, after asking Congress to repeal the AUMF, has now used it not only to fight an entirely new organization but to move from Iraq into Syria. I didn't mention this as an example because I don't think it's entirely clear- cut. There is in fact an AUMF out there. Eric made the argument that you can stretch the language to include it. President Obama is apparently rather uncertain as to whether he has this authority or not, but he hasn't be en willing to go to Congress and have an honest debate about w hether we should be engaged in it. The Supreme Co urt has consistently said that appropriations are not a substitute for authorization of the actions ."
against,"So as Eric said, we didn't use the word ""abdication,"" and for good reason, because, well, legally, the Supr eme Court has, since the 1930s, sustained the notion that it's lawful for Congress to delegate important policy -making power to the president for just the reasons we stated, Congress lacks -- as a deliberative body, lacks the capacity, doesn't have the tim e to answer all these questions itself, and it also lacks the expertise to do so. And that means as a social matter as well as a legal matter, it's a good thing that Congress has the authority to delegate this power to the president."
for,"I think I definitely agree with that. I mean, our system is broken in many ways. The idea was to have these checks and balances that were supposed to work against each other so that the institutional interests of Congress would be working agai nst the institutional interests of the president. And they would each be kind of policing those boundaries. And that is supposed to help us maintain the system. It doesn't allow tyranny to take over, right? I hope I'm not sort of veering into T yran nop hobia. But our challenge is -- But our challenge is that now -- and maybe even in some ways it's the political parties have become too -- too committed perhaps to defend ing their own party rather than defending their own institutions. So you'll have, in cases of both Bush and Obama, I think, their partisan interests of the members of Congress will defend their own president's party rather than actually standing up for those boundaries. We used to have people -- I mean, Senator Robert Byrd was known as a real institutionalist who stood for the interests of the Senate, not just the interests of his own party. And unfortunately, there aren't that many people l ike that anymore. So it's important for us to remember what those boundaries are, and, you know, help to remind the government. We need to have people policing these boundaries -- See, I think the way our system works is that we have institutional checks. The courts are an institutional check. Congress is an institutional check. Ultimately though, it is going to be the public that is the only real check. And as long as our members of Congress and our judges do not believe that the American people care about checks and balances, then they are not going to be very motivated to do this. And I think that the public has a very real role, not a direct role, but a powerful real role in motivating our political system to care again about the way in which our government is structured."
against,"Well, I'm glad to hear Michael quoting from my book again or paraphrasing perhaps. One of the arguments in the book is that it is, in fact, the public --"
for,Love the book.
against,"-- pardon -- the public -- yes, good -- the public and the press and the party system to some extent, they're all of these institutions that have arisen which control the president, that make sure that the president doesn't go too far. And then there are -- of course, there still are real institutional constraints. Obama did not get everything he wanted from Congress. Bush did not get everything he wanted from Congress. No president has gotten everything that they want from Congress. Bush, Obama, previous presidents have frequently found themselves thwarted by the courts, not neces sarily the Supreme Court, it could be a lower court as well. So the -- there are a great many constraints on how the president can behave. Michael McConnell:But may I just say why -- the only thing I disagree with Eric's book about, I mean, much that -- a lot of it is really very good analysis. But Eric believes that law no longer constrains the executive and should no longer constrain it. But the ""unbound executive"" means that the executive is not bound by law, still bound by a lot of things, culture and politics and so forth -- I think that law is a very important part of the constraints on the executive. That's not -- it's the -- the argument of the book is that the traditional system of separation of powers as it existed in the 18th century has lost the force that the founders wanted."
for,"I haven't heard the question yet. Well, of course we're in a different world, but we're in a world where it is as important as ever to make sure that our -- the elements of our government operate according to the limits. It is so tempting -- you just loo k around the world at the Putins and the Chavezes and the Berlusconis in Italy. We have seen so many countries taken down the road of executive unilateralism, and it is not a good thing. Yes, the world has changed, and it's given --"
against,"18th century, population three million, homogenous population, people lived and worked on farms, small towns and states could do all the law and all the administration that was necessary. Today, population 300 million, global economy, global defense needs, the states can no longer handle this administratively. You need a national government to do this, and you need a strong leader of the national government to run the government."
for,"I think we still have a government of the people by the people for the people. The government still should have its powers limited by those given to it by the people in the Constitution. And so, well, yes, things have changed. Those limits are still necessary. And you know, maybe if the government does a few -- some fewer things and doesn't invade so many aspects of American life, they would actually have time to achieve all of it. But I think our constitutional limits certainly are still there. And even if w e don't need it anymore, the question still stands. Did he usurp the powers of the Constitution? "
against,"The question is, ""What are those limits?"" And there are two views on the table. One is the view that we should adopt the limits that we had in the 18th century, with all the facts that Eric said. The other is that we should have the limits that the Supreme Court has endorsed over the last century, acknowledge the realities of today. And all of the examples that we've talked about have all been examples, really of democratic responsiv eness by the president to w hat the public wanted. That's what Carrie started with -- the idea that we should listen to the people. And that supports our position."
for," Have you ever w ondered why we go through all this trouble of having elections every two years for our Congress and four years for the president? It really would be a lot more efficient, I'm sure, to just give all the power to one person. They can make the laws. They can execute the laws, et cetera. But the reason our framers chose not to do it that way is because they had experienced what happens when you have all that power concentrated in a single government. Their belief was that it leads to tyranny. And t hat's why they created the Constitution, with its separate checks and balances, because they thought that was the best way to preserve our liberty. When we're talking about these constitutional powers, it's those same powers that applied Washington, applie d for Lincoln, applied for Nixon, Bush, and Obama, and they're the ones that are going to apply to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton has already said she is going to take President Obama's executive orders for immigration and go even furthe r with them. Donald Trump said essentially the same thing. He's going to use executive orders too, except he said he's going to use them much better and they're going to serve much better purpose than what he's done. So, I don't know -- they're going to be gilded or something. But the problem is, President Obama did promise to restore the constitutional balance between Congress and the president, but he didn't. He was tempted by the power of the office, by the expediency, or just -- in his mind -- by the greater good. I think there's a lot of people here who do think, ""Well, maybe this isn't working.  That may be true. Maybe we do need to amend our Constitution. Maybe we need to change it to -- in some ways."" But even if we think this, you don't have to show that our country has devolved into tyranny to acknowled ge, confirm the proposition of this debate, because I think it's clear from w hat we talked about -- the rece ss appointments we haven't even had a chance to discus s. I don't think they rebutted anything I've said on that -- and the appropriations the president has clearly overstepped his bounds, including re -writing the law, the authorization of war without Congress, et cetera. Because the president has done so repe atedly -- he has usurped the powers of Congress -- I ask you to vote yes in favor of the proposition."
against,"So, when I was a brand new lawyer, fresh out of law school, I interviewed for a job in the Department of Justice, in a little unit that spent its time investigating municipal police departments. And the year of my interview was 2000, right in the middl e of the George W. Bush/Al Gore presidential race. And in the interview, I recall vividly asking the lawyer what would happen to the work the unit did if Bush won the election rather than Al Gore. And he was a little bit annoyed. But the reason I asked him was exactly the reason why Eric and I are here tonight, arguing against the proposition. It was because I knew that each presidential administration comes with a mandate from the people and a set of priorities that might be different than the last preside ntial administration. And that's a crucial point, right? That's what gives an administration the power to pivot, to focus on issues that are socially important in the moment. That's why the Justice Department t oday has recently been able to reinvigorate it s investigations of local police departments after the events of Ferguson and Baltimore and elsewhere. T hat's democracy, it's not tyranny, and that's why you should vote against the proposition."
for,"I've long told my students in constitutional law that when thinking about issues of constitutional power they should think not about presidents or leaders that they admire and trust, bu t ones that they disagree with, ones that they don't trust. And they always jus t thought I was some kind of fuddy -duddy. We're at a different moment. And suddenly I see light comi ng into their eyes and a new ly dawning recognition that maybe these constitutional limits are there for a reason, maybe, as, well, Benjamin Franklin sai d a few blocks down the road, maybe enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. We've not been talking about speedbumps. We've not been talking about congressional delegations that Adam wants to talk about. We've been talking about v ery important changes not over 200 years but over the last eight, 12, 16 years. We're talking about presidents who have spent money that wasn't appropriated. We've talked aboutpresidents going to war without even asking Congress for authorization. We're talking about presidents blatantly deciding not to enforce our laws when that very presiden t knew and said beforehand that that would not be an appropriate use of the office. We've been talking about national security violations that even -- that Eric Posner in his book at least says are entirely illegal. This will go on unless the American public is willing to stand up and say, ""This is a problem."" Join President Obama as candidate, saying, ""This is a serious problem. The presidents have usurped authority that has properly been vested by our Constitution in Congress."" "
against,"You might not have noticed, but while people were speaking I went onto my iPhone. And I went to rightdiagnosis.com to chec k out, ""What's the cure for T yr an nophobia ?"" And the answer is, ""statistics."" And so I thought I would give you a few statistics here. And the idea here is to show you that things aren't really bad, especially when we focus on the current president. So as has been mentioned, presidents use executive orders. They do this because Congress has told them to regulate in various ways and take other action. But an executive order is just an order to his subordinates to do those things. Well, what is the reco rd like? Reagan, before the 16-year period Michael told us about, issued 381 executive orders over two terms. Clinton issued 364. Bush issued 291. Obama issued 242 through seven and a third years, pretty much in line with his pr edecessors, maybe a little less. Another example, signing statements, during the Bush administration controversy erupted because George Bush would issue these statements when he signed bills saying that while he's signing this bill there are certain provi sions that he would not enforce because they were in conflict with his constitutional powers. So I looked up the numbers for that as well. Now, Reagan issued 250 signing statements, Clinton, 381, Bush, himself, 161. What about Obama? Through 2014, 30. And then finally the scary topic of recess appointments, the president appoints something like 1,200 to 1,400 people per year in the executive branch. He's allowed to make appointments when Congress is in recess, Reagan, 232, Clinton, 139, Bus h, 171, Obama through six years, 32. Vote against the motion."
