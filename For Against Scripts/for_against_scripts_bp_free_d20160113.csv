for,"We expected that there was going to be a conflict, but the initial demonstrations in 2011 were , for the most part , very peaceful. There were only a few scattered incidents of violence. But the numbers were swelling very rapidly. We soon had hundreds of thousands of peaceful marchers in cities across Syria. So we knew that the country was hurtling towards major change. It's my pleasure, my honor, to be on a team with David Miliband. We've helped 415 Syrians over the four years of the Civil War out of the 10,000 a year that we resettle from all countries across the U.S."
against,"A Princess Diana moment is a moment of intense emotionality that can override reason and judgment, and it has a kind of subtly coercive element against those who might otherwise be moved to say s omething different. I think I want to add one other element to that generous introduction you ga ve me, which is that I was born in Toronto, Canada, and I'm a naturalized U.S. citizen. So, I have seen the migration system from the inside, as well as as a policy analyst.  John Donvan:Ladies and gentlemen, David Frum. And your partner? I am so pleased to be here with Jessica Vaughan, who is one of America's leading authorities on the costs of migration and resettlement. Oh, well, I think it does translate well because it's a reminder that we care about the people, but the numbers are also important, particularly the number of people and the number we admit is not necessarily the best yardstick for evaluating the success of a program."
for,"  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Intelligence Squared for bringing us together tonight and I want to thank you and our opponents for coming here tonight to debate this vital topic. Our case for the motion rests on three pillars : that admitting 100,000 Syrian refugees to the United States is the right thing to do, that it's a practical thing to do, and that it's a smart thing to do. It's the right thing to do not just because these are people in great need, but because the history of this country speaks to refugee resettlement as a core part of the American story. It will also transform obviously 100,000 lives and bring wider benefits to the U.S. Secondly, we will argue that it's a practical thing to do, because the U. S. has a proven , secure and effective system for refugee resettlement -- far, far better than the chaotic scenes you see in Europe at the moment. We will show tonight that there is no parallel between the boat loads of people arriving in Europe and the pi peline of admissions that exist in the United States. And the third thing is that we will show you it's a smart thing to do to support this motion, because the last thing that ISIS and other hatemongers around the world want is for the U.S. to be a bea con of hope and inclusion and a beacon of tolerance for the world. The battle against extremism is fought not just by bombs and special forces. It's a battle of ideas and it's a battle of examples. And our greatest weapon is the living reality of c ommunities that show how to cross boundaries of race, religion, and color. Support the motion and you will do what is right, what is practical, and what is smart. I want to explain how Ambassador Ford and I are going to share the work tonight. The International Rescue Committee has 2,000 staff working inside Syria today. We have 1,500 staff in the neighboring states of Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Turkey. We also have 400 staff now in Greece, welcom ing refugees as they come off the boats. And we also have 800 staff in 26 U.S. cities organizing refugee resettlement. Because of that, I'm going to use my opening statement to explain why refugee resettlement is a core part of a comprehensive approach to the Syrian catastrophe. And then we have the genuinely unique advantage of Ambassador Ford using all of his insight into the Middle East to show why significant refugee resettlement is secure, how refugees are the most vetted population to arrive in the United States, and also how refugee resettlement is an importan t part of the battle against ISIS. Now, the Syria war shows few signs of ending. And the refugees desperately need help. Most of them are in the Middle East. And that's where most of the help is going. But for a minority, refugee resettlement is an essential part of the response. Let me explain why. Refugee resettlement in richer countries, safer countries , offers unique benefits. For those who are most vulnerable, for the kids with autism, for the people who have had their limbs blown off by ba rrel bombs, the care that is on offer in countries like this has no parallel. Secondly, and importantly, resettlement is essential, because countries like Lebanon and Jordan simply cannot cope with the millions of refugees that they have. Jordan is your se cond closest ally in the Middle East. It's a country of six million people. It has 650,000 refugees. That is like the whole of Poland coming to America in the space of four years. They're dealing with it alone at the moment. And thirdly, resettl ement is needed now, because an organized, legal route to hope in the U.S., as well as in Canada and Australia, will disempower the smugglers who are currently charging 1,200 e uros for desperate people to get the six kilometers from Turkey to Greece. Now, no one is saying that the majority of Syrian refugees will end up coming to the U.S. No one is saying that refugee resettlement is an alternative to aid in the Middle East or will bring the war to the end. But resettlement of 100,000 refugees is important. And for goodness sake, if Australia can take 18,000, if Canada can take 25,000, if France can take 35,000, then the United States, 10 times the size of Canada, can take 100,000 refugees. I can say this as a foreigner in this country who's working here. The U.S. has shown the world how to make refugee resettlement work. Get the kids into school. Teach the parents English. Get them a job. Get them on the path to citizenship. And you have patriotic and productive citizens. Don't just ask me. Ask Ma deline Albright. Ask the founders of great companies around the country. Ask Elie Wiesel. Ask them and think of the contribution that they've made to the United States. The direct federal cost of services and benefits associated with resettling 100,000 ref ugees in this country -- let me tell you what it is. It's 1.4 cents per American per day. That's the direct federal cost of services and benefits. It's true that that doesn't include health care costs or school costs. But nor does it include the taxes that Syrians pay when they work. And let me give you figures from my organization. 415 Syrians resettled by the IRC. Our services show that last year, 8 out of 10 Syrians who we resettled were in work within six months of getting to the United States. And there's one other unique resource of this country : Syrian -American communities across the country who are successful. The business people in San Diego, the doctors in Cleveland, the shopkeepers in New York -- there are Syrian -American communi ties ready to welcome and integrate more Syrians who come here. Our opponents will ask you tonight to shatter the American dream for 100,000 people in desperate need of hope. And we ask you to keep that dream alive. These people are sitting in Beirut, and they're sitting in Amman, and they're sitting in Istanbul. And they're asking themselves a simple question : ""Does America stand for anything anymore?"" We say it does. The motion affirms America's historic contribution to a world defined by respect, not ret ribution. And ask yourself : Do a limited number of Syrian refugees need help and a fresh start in life? We say, ""Yes."" Has America got a good record of making a success of refugee resettlement? We say, ""Yes."" And doesn't the battle against extre mism require our countries to set an example of inclusion and integration? We say the answer to all these questions is a resounding ""Yes."" we don't say the policies are easy.  They're not simple or easy. But they are clear. We urge you to suppo rt the motion with your head and your heart. Thank you very much indeed."
against,"Tonight, we debate how to respond to one of the most terrible humanitarian disasters of the post- Cold War era -- perhaps the very most terrible disaster of them all. Human beings are at risk, are suffering, are dying, have died. As we convene tonight, th e forces of Hezbollah and the Assad R egime are deliberately starving thousands of besiege d people in the town of Madaya . All sides of this debate take these grim issues deeply and seriously to heart. What is to be done? At the time when this debate topic was proposed, in October, President Obama was mocking concerns about the Syrian refugees as fear o f widows and orphans. Since then have come the coordinated mass sexual assaults by migrants and refugees in Cologne and other German cities. This past weekend , three Syrian refugees were arrested in Munich for attacking two German girls at a public school, raping one. The victims of sexual abuse by refugees and migrants in Germany, and Austria, and Sweden -- since the turn of the year -- now number nearly 1,000. The giddy mood of the fall has faded. Almost two -thirds of Germans say their country has accepted too many refugees. And here in the United States, too, a new sobriety about Syrian refugees is taking hold. Jessica and I welcome tonight's debate as a step toward this new sobriety. Here's ourplan for tonight. I will open by arguing that mass resettlement of refugees in the Middle East is not in the American interest. When I say ""mass,"" I mean mass. Clearly, there are individuals and families who need to be in the West, who have family connections, who belong to the small but real former Syrian urban elite. Many of them have actually already resettled themselves with friends and family here in the West. That is not who we are talking abo ut tonight. Tonight we are talking about what is to be done with the very, very large numbers of Syrian refugees who do not have prior connections to the West, who are not -- who have no family, who are not connected to people here, and who lack the aptitudes and skills that would normally qualify them for the usual immigration processes. Jessica will then continue the argument by demonstrating that mass resettlement isn't in the refugees' interests either, for one simple economic reas on. It costs about 13 times as much to resettle one refugee family in the United States as it does to resettle them closer to home. We hope, tonight, that we can reason together. Yet, there are people -- not our opponents -- distinguished men of great acco mplishment. But there are people urging mass resettlement of refugees to the West, who relied heavily on bullying and name -calling to make their case. Those who don't agree are cowards, or racists, or worse. The memory of the victims of the Nazi Holocaust has been invoked to justify policy that actually puts at even greater risk than already is the case the desperately imperiled last Jewish communit ies of Europe. When Jessica and I speak to your reason and judgment, it is not because we lack compassion for those in danger and need. We'll show you policy alternatives for the crisis in Syria that meet every call of conscience. But policy must not be -- policy that is supported by untruths, by concealments, and epithets is no comp assion at all. So, here are some truths. Despite the posters that remind us that Albert Einstein was once a refugee, the social, economic, and cultural gap between the global South and the global North, between the Middle East and the Middle West, is extre mely wide and very difficult to cross. Before the Syrian Civil War began in 2010, the average Syrian had less than six years of formal schooling -- less even than Egypt, according to the -- less even than in Egypt, according to the U.N. Development Index. About one -fifth of Syrians mad e their living as agricultural laborers. Women were harshly subordinated. Only about 13 percent of Syrian women worked outside the home, and their literacy levels were significantly lower than those of men. Pre-war Syria was a tribal society characterized by lawlessness, high levels of religious fundamentalism, and deep, deep sectarian animosities. It's often suggested that because the Syrian population has beencaught in the crossfire between ISIS and the Assad Regime, that, that population must, therefore, be unsympathetic to radical Islam. But rejecting ISIS, the demented and murderous ideology of ISIS, is not the same thing as accepting liberal democracy or the equality of women and gays or coexistence with Christians and Jews. We've seen in the reception centers of Germany that Syrian -Sunni Muslim refugees have violently attacked Christians, the Yazidis, and people they perceive as gay. The New York Times reported on January 2nd on the brutal abuse of Syri an refugee women by their husbands and family members, including the unwillingness of many refugee men to allow their wives to attend classes unsupervised or even to go out once a week for a walk in an all- female group. We may be told that mig rants to the United States will be screened more carefully than the no-questions -asked approach taken in Germany and across Europe. As Jessica will show in her remarks, this talk is empty. But what needs to be stressed even more is that screening is impo ssible. Radicalization is increasingly something that happens in the West among the second generation of Middle Eastern migrants, those who will be born here. It was people born in the West who carried out the Paris massacres, who murdered the editorial staff at Charlie Hebdo, and the shoppers at Paris' s Kosher Hyper Cacher , who shot up the Brussels Jewish Community Center and a Jewish School in Toulouse . It was a man born in Chicago, Illinois, who committed mass slaughter in San Bernardino. To date, the United States has suffered far less from this internal self-radicalization than Europe has suffered. Americans owe their greater security to a very practical fact. While the United States has experienced a large surge of low -skilled migra tion from countries in this hemisphere, its migration from the greater Middle East has been more carefully selected. Migrants who bring with them the skills and values that lead to success in the United States are likely to raise successful and well- integrated children. Those who don't, won't. We have a very relevant precedent for what's proposed with the Syrians, America's experience with Somalian refugees. Since 1990, the United States has admitted the same -- about the same round number of Somalian r efugees that is proposed for Syria tonight, about 100,000 people. A quarter century onward, unemployment amongst Somali Americans exceeds 20 percent, and the second largest Somali community in the country, in the state of Maine, half the men never worked at all in the five years before the Great Recession started. Almost all Somali Americans , to this day , receive some form of cash or food assistance."
for,"John, thank you very much. And thank you, all, for attending. Syria is a huge human tragedy. I think it's worth remembering this little statistic, which I came across yesterday when I was doing some reading, t he Syrian conflict, which has been going on now for four years, has affected more people than Hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami, a nd the Haitian earthquake, combined. This is not a normal situation. This is not a normal situation. And in an abnormal situation, people look to the United States. That's what global leadership is about. We are special that way. And I have to tell you, having served as an American ambassador in Algeria and having served as an American ambassador in Syria, it's a hug e honor to represent a country that is known for its humanistic values and is known for its willingness to make hard decisions and to lea d. And so what David and I are asking tonight of you , as you think about this motion, is not to let your fear dominate, but rather to let both your reason and your hearts dominate. I want to say a few things about security since David raised some of the issues that have come up in Germany. Yes, there have been problems in Germany. We ca n discuss that in greater detail, David, if you'd like. The process by which people are brought into the United States is completely different from what's going on in Germany and other countries in Europe. It is a very orderly process. Is it perfect? N o. No human endeavor is perfect, but it's quite, quite good. How many of you have seen a terrorist incident by a refugee here in the United States? Anybody seen one? 785,000 refugees, 115,000, more than 115,000, Iraqi refugees have come int o the United States. Has anybody seen any of them commit a mass shooting? Terrorist incident at a mall?  There have been some Iraqis arrested for terrorism, that is true. I think the latest number, given events last week, is five out of rough ly 115,000. That is actually a small number and in each of these cases federal authorities were able to intervene before they did any damage. By the way, out of those five arrested, three of them were arrested for activities outside the United States that were not targeted at Americans. So I ask you to sort of put in relative context the security risk, but I want to add also what U.S. government agencies do to help bring that risk down. I won't go into all of the detail now, although I would be delighted if David and Jessica want to do that. I would just say this. The process of screening is very long. It takes 18 to 24 months for the average Syrian refugee to get through the security screening process. Multiple U.S. government intelligence agen cies, including the CIA, the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Defense Department, the State Department, and other intelligence agencies are involved in building a dossier for each refugee case. Let me say that again. Each refugee case has a n intelligence community driven dossier. That's why it takes 18 to 24 months. So we can bring them in with an assurance of very good safety, and the record shows that. The record shows that safety. Now I want to talk also because I was in the Middle Ea st, yesterday I was in front of the Congress talking about the Islamic State and our efforts to battle and to eliminate the Islamic State. I want you to understand that the Islamic State wants the Americans to reject refugees from Syria. The Islamic State wants the United States to say we don't want Syrian refugees. We don't want Muslims coming to the United States. The Islamic State wants to paint this as a battle between the Christian West and the Muslim world. That helps their recruitmen t. That helps their recruitment. It's not an accident that a terrorist organization with links to al- Qaeda and the Islamic State in Somalia called Al-Shabaab put a Donald Trump spot in some of their online recruitment materials. It helps them recruit . A nd so as we think about how to pursue the battle against the Islamic State, which involves military operations, diplomatic efforts to build a coalition, efforts to cut off their finances and other things, our policy on refugees must fit into that broader p olicy context. Otherwise, our right hand is undermining what our military diplomatic treasury department -led financial efforts are doing. We don't want that. We don't want that. Finally, I just want to conclude with one remark about what David said. I lived in Syria for a bit over a year and I visited it as a tourist several times. I never sawthat Syria was lawless. I never saw that Syria was particularly tribal. Most Syrians are not tribal because they live in big cities. Damascus, Homs -- they d id before the conflict. They're big cities, very urban. And they're exceptionally sophisticated. And in fact, if you look at the Syrian immigrant population here in the United States, the Syrian -American communities here in the United States, you will see that as well. Doctors, business owners -- here in New York City, many, many Syrian -American -owned businesses. It is an urbane culture. It is not a lawless culture. And it is most certainly not a radical Islamic culture.  And so, again, I ask you to think about the security, think about the safety, think about our values. And vote for the motion. Thank you so much."
against," And thank you, John. So, David very eloquently outlined the big picture around -- surrounding the reasons why we are opposed to this motion to bring in 100,000 Syrian refugees. And I'm going to fill that in with some details. This motion is irresponsible in the extreme. I'm going to explain the two main reasons why 60 percent of the American public is opposed to this proposal and why you should be too. The main reason is that it's simply an enormous and unacceptable security risk to our country. It's also an enormous and unacceptable financial burden on the communities where these refugees will be placed, and on American taxpayers. 100,000 is a huge number. It's two times the current annual flow of refugees, two times the number that we've been bringing in in recent years. It's five times the number -- annual number of Iraqis that we've been bringing it. It's so large and disproportionate to our agency's capacity to process them that one top State Department official, the woman who's in charge ofmanaging the refugee program, said -- and I'm quoting -- ""The notion that we could get to 100,000 refugees from Syria just isn't possible."" And it's not that it's a question of a will to do something or, you know, organizing logistics. The security situation today is really different from other times in our history. And this population of Syrians is really different from some of the other refugee populations that we admit. The main thing is that -- I mean, we know that terror groups are trying to infiltrate the refugee flow. I'm willing to take them at their word. They've told us that. They're seeking to exploit it. It has -- it's -- we need to pay attention to what's happening in Europe, not just Paris and other -- but other places. But these refugees have all -- who were terrorists have already succeeded in in infiltrating our flow. There have been 15 instances, just since 2014, of either refugees who were terrorists, who were admitted, m istakenly. We didn't catch them. Or people admitted as refugees who later became terrorists. And this is not a small problem. Right now, the FBI has something like 900 ongoing investigations into people who are associated with ISIS. But there h as been more than a dozen -- probably more like 15 instances -- of people who really were terrorists. They were training people to make bombs so that they could attack American soldiers. They had already attacked American soldiers overseas. It's real. It's a risk. And it's just not a couple of people. We've -- when you hear these stories of actual terrorists who came in as actual refugees, and then we hear the president and his allies, who are pushing for this 100,000 Syrian refugees to be admitt ed -- and talk about the 18 to 24 -month vetting period, which is really, you know, more of a waiting period than -- no one spends 18 to 24 months investigating refugees. We hear that they have three interviews. We hear that they're fingerprinted. We hear t hat we check databases. The truth is that even our fabulous screening system, which is supposedly better than anyone else's in the world has made some mistakes before. And that's why -- don't believe me -- believe the Director of the FBI, who, with his top staff, has testified before Congress to say that it simply can't be done. We don't have the assets there to vet them against. As he says, we can check databases until the cows come home. But we have no information from the government, no one w e know that we can talk to about these individuals. And we have to remember -- these are -- these refugees are chosen by U .N . employees who are hired locally. You heard it. We actually outsource the selection of refugees and the first two most important in terviews to U.N. s taff from the -- this region. They're, I'm sure, great, hardworking people. But their mission is to help people, not to worry about what's going to happenonce that refugee arrives in the United States. That job is done by our government officials. But they simply don't have the tools to do it. It's an impossible task. Now, even if we were able to overcome the very real security concerns and risks, and even if we were to find a machine that could read people's mind or, you know, see into the future whether or not they're going to become a terrorist, there's another huge reason to vote -- to say no to this proposal, to admit 100,000 Syrian refugees. And that is the huge fiscal cost to taxpayers and to the communities where they're going to be placed. The U.N. has two options to help refugees. One is integration near where they are. And the other is resettlement. And resettlement is definitely the luxury option, for sure. 100,000 Syrian refugees, quit e simply, will break the bank of many communities. My organization has added up the cost of -- both the federal cos ts that David referred to -- cash, housing assistance, job training, health care, language training, special education -- but also the local costs. According to the federal government, 91 percent of refugees from the Middle East are on food stamps. 19:27: 44 68 percent of them are qualifying for cash assistance. The total five -year cost for one Syrian refugee is going to be $64,000. That figure is, as David said, 12 times the cost of what the U .N . spends locally helping Syrians in Syria. And as i s typical in these programs that cost money, the cost is going to be borne by the communities where people are -- that are forced to absorb these individuals, not by the people who were talking the loudest and trying to push it on these communities. They'r e not going to Stanford, Connecticut and Short Hills, New Jersey. They're going to Springfield, Massachusetts, and Idaho, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, where there are lower costs of living. High unemployment. People already there who need services. Schools are already overwhelmed. Let's be clear. We have to acknowledge that our compassion has to be backed up by our wallets. And if we don't provide the problems that David -- the services that they need, the problems that David so eloquently artic ulated are going to be something that we have to deal with in the future. And that's why the better, responsible thing to do is to say ""No"" to the proposal to bring in 100,000 Syrian refugees."
for,"I think there's a really important piece of understanding for people. The jihadists threat we face, the threat of violent jihadist extremism, is very strategic in the actions that it takes, it seeks to sow fear among civilians, not just among armed forces, and it seeks to propagate what it calls, ""a clash of civilizations,"" borrowing from a Wes tern book of that name. And the whole purpose of their terrorist activity is precisely to foment the kind of fear that would lead people to say, ""America should admit no refugees,"" from Syria. And the reason is very, very simple. They want -- their narrative is explicit, and it is that the Muslim world, one and a half billion Muslims around the world, are in the situation they are because of Christians and Jews. That is the essential heart of the jihadist message. And by saying, ""No Syrians s hould come to this country,"" you confirm all the prejudice at the heart of their message. It's a very, very, simple point, and we must look -- John Donvan: -- I think that your opponents -- your opponents are not saying, ""No Syrians should come to this country."" They are very explicit about that. Well, how many are they saying? I mean, please ask them how many Syrians would be the right number?"
against,"Well, let's look at Westerners who actually have been recruited to ISIS, and let's see what their grievances were. We do many things that ISIS doesn't like. We don't force women to wear veils, we don't subordinate Christians and Jews, and we don't allow young men opportunities to engage i n massive gratuitous violence. That is what attracts people to ISIS. Imbedded in what David Miliband just said is an assumption that I urge you to reject, which is that ISIS's grievance -- ""ISIS is a kind of civilrights organization that has a -- that responds to rational grievances about job discrimination and exclusion."" That is not true. It is a cult that, in fact, delights in violence in its own . That's why they recruit by showing videos of burning people alive and dro wning them in cages. Most people would be repelled. The people they know they want are attracted. At some level we have to do -- this argument is a debater's point in the worst sense of the term, it's not true. Allowing women to go about unveiled -- -- not enslaving people, those things also they use. I think the people in this room can vote no with impunity, knowing that wha t they are doing is enhancing the safety of their society. And if this argument is right, you are crediting ISIS as a kind of global Islamic civil rights organization, and I really urge you to reject that idea."
for," First, everybody -- none of us here like the Islamic State, and I certainly wouldn't for a minute -- no, I mean -- -- they murdered -- I mean, I know one of the people they murdered. And he was a wonderful man, was a journalist, Jim Foley. So it's not that they're a civil rights organization and they have facts. It's all about perception. It's all about perception. And the Islamic State -- I mean, I'm sure many of the people in the audience, many all of y ou, have seen these videos they do. It's all about perception. It's Hollywood in an Islamic jihadi kind of way, and they play on that. It has nothing to do with facts. It has everything to do with perception. That's why this group in Somalia, Shabaa b, is using Donald Trump now to help with its recruitment. It has nothing to do with the facts. It has to do with the perception."
against,"Look, clearly ISIS is not having any trouble recruiting with or without Donald Trump. ""They hate us,"" as some clever writer recently said, ""not because of what we do, because of who we are."" And they're not going to be any nicer to us if we accept even 500,000 refugees from Syria. That ’s just a fact. I don't think it's relevant to the debate because the question is what should the United States government do and the primary responsibility of our government is to look after our national interests and to look after Americans and the people who are living here, -- Germany has admitted more than a million Syrian refugees in the past 12 months. Just a few da ys ago an ISIS Syrian bomber targeted German tourists in Istanbul. You don't get a thank you note."
for,I've actually sat in the chair that oversees the intelligence agencies in the U.K. and I can tel l you exactly what the Jihadist threat is designed to do. It's designed to foment the argument that western values are inimical to Muslim values and by saying we don't want your people in our country you are confirming exactly the point that they are making and it's really wrong to underestimate the importance of the battle of ideas. The core element of our argument of this part of the argument is that we will not win the argument against violent extremism through military means alone. You've got to win the battle of ideas as well.
against,"Well, what we're told is that our vetting system is absolutely fabulous, the best in the world, and that refugees get more vetting than any other type of immigrant, but the fact is number one, Syria and Syrians are different because we do not -- unlike in Iraq and Somalia there's no one there that we can call on the phone to ask about whether what an applican t has put on their application is true. It could, yeah. If you really are serious about vetting, that is what is done. You verify the claims that are made by applicants w ho, by the way, have a huge incentive to do whatever it takes to accomplish what they want if what they want is to either infiltrate our flow as an ISIS operative or simply get the heck out of Syria. We don't -- you know, there's -- we don't have any info rmation to vet against in the case of the Syrians and, again, we've outsourced these critical interviews to U.N. employees whose mission is to try to help people and to want to believe what they say. It's basically an honor system. Even if we have great databases, though, they've failed before. We've already -- you know, even the vetting of Iraqis and Somalians was supposedly better. There have been terrorists, people funding terrorism, people committing t errorism who were admitted from Iraq and from other countries as refugees. So we've made mistakes before, even when it was supposedly easier."
for," When I was in Syria I oversaw a refugee operation of the United States government. It was in our embassy in Damascus and when I was deputy ambassador in Iraq we had a similar refugee office for Iraqi refugees coming to the United States. So, a couple of points I'd make.  Yes, your government's job is to protect your security, job one. Believe me, people in the United States government do know that. Number two. The question is how best to guarantee American security. Is it to have a coordinated policy or to have different hands working at cross purposes? Number three, no one i n the United States government ever allows the United Nations to decide who comes in to the United States.  I feel pretty strongly about that and, Jessica, if you want to discuss it further we can. Number four, number four, we do hav e information -- and it doesn't come from the Syrian government. But you know what? The Syrian government lies. I've seen that firsthand. The Syrian government -- not only does it starve people and use chemical weapons against them, and drop barrel bombs on them, but it smears people. It smeared me personally. I'm frankly happy that we don't have to depend on the Syrian government for the information we use -- -- to bring refugees here. A last point -- No. I'm not finished. Last point. My last point."
against,"In the past decade, about 50 Somali Americans have traveled to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaa b, a terror organization. About 10 Somali Americans in the past two years have been charged with plotting to assist ISIS. One just in December. Now, they weren't refugees. They were the children of refugees. When you admit somebody, you are admitting their posterity. And one of the ideas that is important to keep in mind is that the problems of admitting a mismatched population tend to show up in the second generation, not the first. One more point. The Boston Bombing -- Marathon bombers, the Tsa rnaev brothers -- they're not refugees. They were asylum seekers. In the immigration world, that technical legal distinction has a lot of importance. But in real life, I'm not sure it should matter so much.  -- but -- Let's understand what he said. Just one sentence and I'll turn it over -- that what he said is we don't rely on the Syrian government, which is great.  But what do you rely on other than the word of the person himself -- -- or herself?   And again, it's important to understand -- it's the U.N. that decides whether someone is a refugee. And they'r e selecting people from the population who, by the way, are among the poorest of the poor in that country. The people -- anyone with any education and get up and go already went -- got up and went. So, it is a different population. The U.N. is deciding who is a refugee and the U.N. is deciding who will be resettled to the United States. And only then are these cases turned over to the United States government toguess whether or not the person has something of concern in their background, has beliefs of concern -- -- is likely to succeed. So, they're created -- the U.N. is deciding which pool of refugees are -- that the United States can review -- That's a fact."
for,"The last point I wanted to make -- I -- before I was interrupted -- -- is that this is -- let's be frank. This is partly an intelligence operation. A friend of mine who is working on this actually sent me a detail about it. So, we have CIA. We have the FBI. National Center for Counter -Terrorism. Defense Department. There's even biometric data that is first collected from the refugees by the United Nations, a screening process that Jessica mentioned. Then it's checked back with biometric data that our intelligence agencies have. Several different offices of Homeland Security. Now, none of these are infallible. Let me say that again. None of these are infallible. However, there are lots of failsafe mechanisms. And maybe these-- the two most important -- they don't rely on one single source of information. They certainly don't rely only on the interview or the interviews that the refugee applicants have. They collect other information from other sources about where they come from , their town, their neig hborhood, their neighbors. A lot of people have been disqualified from coming to the United States because they developed information through other sources that they sold a falafel sandwich to a Free Syrian Army soldier.  -- is not -- so, last -- Two points. One, biometrics means iris scanning. So, the biggest danger in intelligence is that someone is impersonating someone else. The iris scanning make s it impossible for people to impersonate each other. Second, absolutely key point. Jessica says the U.S. has to guess whether or not someone is going to be okay. The boot is on the other foot. The refugee has to prove that they are no threat to America. There's no responsibility on America to take them. The refugee has to prove that they're going to be a responsible resident of this country, and hopefully then become a citizen."
against," Well, while we all worked for our respective State Departments, obviously, my esteemed opponents over there never worked behind a visa window, because people just lie to you all day long down there. And it is an honor system. And I've -- but I want to ask, you know, by extension of your logic, you admit we're going to make mistakes. How many terrorist mis takes would be acceptable for us to admit to our refugee . How many is acceptable?"
for,"Can I answer that real quick? First -- I did work behind a visa window in two Middle Eastern coun tries. And of course they lie to you. I mean, that's what professionals do. You sort of figure out who's telling the truth and who's not.  Second point. Over 115,000 Iraqi refugees have come in from Iraq. I t's a country not so different from Syria . Some differences. I've lived in both. But I would say they are roughly comparable. 115,000 allowed in. Five, including two last week, have been arrested on terrorism charges. Refugees arrested on terrorism charges . And as I said, three of them arrested for working with terrorist groups not related to the United States but involved in the fight -- -- in the Middle East. I should -- -- never have resigned."
against,"Terrorism is not the only kind of security problem. There are other kinds of delinquency. There are other kinds of criminality. The thing I would really want people to focus on is popular -- this -- we are not arguing for zero. And we're not -- we are arguing for selection. We are arguing that people who have -- who are likely to succeed here, who have deep family contacts, and who really are at risk, because of their liberal democratic views, inside the Middle East -- yes, they can -- they belong in the West. But understand. We're talking about a pop ulation that, although many of it is urban, it's one-fifth agricultural population. It's a population median or -- typical levels of education are six years, less for women. High levels of religious fundamentalism. And although they have higher levels of human development than we experie nce in Somalia, this is not like the people in Iraq, many of whom had worked with the U.S.armed forces. And that really was the urban elite of Iraq. Different populations succeed in different ways or fail in different ways. And one of the things that has been disturbing about this debate -- especially from -- not so much our opponents here, who have been very candid -- but from the president and others -- is that there really has been a selling job that refuses to deal with the real dangers and problems. A nd they show up not just in the first generation. But it is not acceptable to say that refugees are no problem. All the terrorist incidents involved their children. That is not, in my mind, a good answer."
for,"A very famous American senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan , said, ""You're entitled to your own opinions. You're not entitled to your own fact."" And -- I'm a newcomer to this country, so I'm allowed to use it. The -- It's -- It's really important that we hold onto the facts here. 785,000 refugees since 2001. 115,000 Iraqis. Five arrested for terrorist offenses. None of them committing terrorist acts. Three of them out of the country . How many Syrian refugees have been arrested in the United States for terrorist -related offenses? The answer is zero. Zero Syrian refugees have been arrested for terrorism- related offenses. Now, when we put those facts, David says, ""Yeah , ah, it's not just about terrorism. They're likely to be delinquents."" And so, we're then on to another argument, where he says, ""Don't worry about the terrorism. That's not my main point. I'm worried thatthey're going to become -- they're not going to be employed or that their sons and daughters are no t going to be employed."" The responsibility, then is -- what is the integration system? And the integration system that I can speak to about, from 26 cities in which we work, is one where 80 percent of people from Syria are in work within six months. Now, the way in which you achieve that is by insuring that you do give people the help. As it happens, 31 percent of Syrians arriving in the United States have got upper secondary or university education, not all of them. Some of them have only go t six years of education. Those who have six years of education need a lot of extra help. The man who was in the box at the State of the Union last night was a surgeon with three Ph.D.s. He doesn't need extra education. He needs a chance to restart his life. And I would say to you that it's very, very important that you hold us to account for facts and separate them out from opinions. And I do want to follow up one point because you said I could earlier. If not 100,000, how many?"
against,"My answer is qualitative, not quantitative, and that's important. So the fact that you have had such good success with your 415 people tells me that you have chosen very well people who are going to integrate in the West. David Miliband : We don't choose them. We don't choose them.  David Miliband : David, we don't choose them. We don't choose them. But this is like -- we all saw the movie, ""The Big Short."" This is like saying, ""The triple A bonds came in great, and, therefore, we're going to keep going through each tranch."" What --we have the example. I mean, it is -- today is, what, the 13th of January -- we have the example of what has just happened in Germany. We have seen what large scale unchecked migration of not the 415, the urban elite, but what you are -- what has been done to that country over the past 30 years. Syria is a country with a population of, what, two million, in the years after World War II. It's got a population before the war started of 23 million. This is a deeply rural society. It is a sectarian society. I don't know the answer to the question, ""How many?"" I would say, ""Few,"" and, ""The few and the right ones."" And most of them should be settled near where they live where, as Jessica pointed out, it is phenomenally economically cheaper. ""If we had a program,"" I said, ""where I can do something badly for a dollar or do it well for seven cents, and you are insisting on doing it badly for a dollar and we can do it well for seven cents, you'd say, ""That is a very poor choice of resou rces. That's --"" I think Bob Rosenkranz said at the very opening at this debate. And that is really the choice, spend seven cents to resettle somebody close to where they live in a compatible society where their skills are relevant, where they can speak the same language, where they can be consistent with their religious traditions, where they're not going to see ways of life that they find offensive, maybe so offensive they resort to violence or their children will, or spend a dollar to resettle them badly in the United States where not the best, not the 415, not the most compatible, but the others will be chronically unemployed, chronically dependent on assistance as the Somalis are, and where you may have some terrorist mistakes in the first g eneration, and a lot of delinquency and criminality problems in the second. our friends.  I would first say that we cannot predict or judge what the success of refugees is going to be based on the people who have already been admitted necessarily, because the population that the U.N. is selecting for resettlement i s very different from those Syrians who came here -- who had the means to come here on their own. But secondly, I don't think it's inconsistent with our values at all to proceed prudently and carefully in low numbers in admission of Syrian refu gees because, as I said in my remarks, we have options in terms of wanting to help people and assist the people displaced by this conflict and our government is obligated to use the limited resources that we have to act on that desire to help in the most c ost effective, efficient way that helps the most people and it just so happens that that option is not resettlement, but by providing assistance to more people in the region. I welcome that question. It's a very important question. This tonight is not a debate about theology. It's a debate about sociology. There's no claim that anybody would make that there’s something inherently dangerous about the Middle East or any particular faith, but it is an observation that under today's circumstances it does objectively happen to be true that there are dangers fro m some people in the Middle East that are different and in many ways greater than dangers from people elsewhere. I think both Jessica and I are advocates of generally a tighter screen on admission to the United States and a lower level of immigration, but I don't think we do any service to anybody to say let's ignore what happens to be true right now, even though I agree with you. I don't think it is inherently true. I don't think it will necessarily be true 100 years from now and it certainly wasn't true 100 years ago."
for,"Look, I'm someone who works in your country, but I'm not a citizen of this country. And when I hear that there are 3,500 Muslims in the American armed forces, when I look at the di versity of this country and the strength that's come from the diversity, when I meet a young man, a refugee who spent the first 15 years of his life in a refugee camp, and then after three years he's been resettled and he's the valedictorian in his high sc hool and he's going to the New York School of Film and Design, what I think is that this country has a genius for bringing people together across lines of race and religion andcolor and creed, and that is something that is incredibly precious and you should be shouting about that from the rooftops. You should be saying to Europe get your act together. Have a properly organized system. Make sure there is education. Make sure they are taught English. Make sure they are on the path to citizens hip. Make sure there is a check after a year for a green card. Make sure that after five years they are checked out to see how they are doing. And I would like to see this country more proud of what it's achieving by being this great beacon to the world, because the truth is you've got a lot to offer."
against,"Omar may I ask you a question. May I ask you a question? What does your mother do? And what level of education does she have? And she works here as a teacher?  Because, as I hope you'll recall, what I said in my remarks about first and second generation is the United States has not, to date, had this problem, precisely because in -- to date it has been true that when the United States has taken people from the greater Mid dle East -- and this is why there's such a stark difference between the American experience and the European experience -- we have selected for people like your parents. And when the parents -- and especially the mothers -- are educate d, and integrated, and succeed, the children succeed. Though, as I said, those who have what it takes to succeed in the Western world -- their children will flourish. And the American experience is testament to that. Europe is the counter -example. What is going on -- one of the things we were debating from that is, should American refugee policy -- should continue to reflect what has been successful about the particular American experience with Muslim immigrants, which has been hugely successful in the United States. They are -- Muslim Americans are better educated than the American norm. They have higher incomes than the American norm. And they have been -- as David Miliband says, they have been active in the Army. And a lot of what is done in the name of counter -- a lot of counter -intelligence services simply could not function without them. They have been a hugely successful community. And the question is, are we going to continue that approach? Or are we going to change to the approach that Europe has taken, that has created these banlieues around European cities, where, in the second generation -- because the parents are poor -- and I keep saying, this is about sociology, not theology. Because the parents are poor, because the parents are no t integrated, and these 100,000 Syrian refugees like the 100,000 Somalis -- who happen to be Muslim, but that's not what's important about them -- are going to not -- the likelihood that they are not going to be a success -- -- and their children are then going to be attracted to whatever is around. And in 30 years from now, if it's Islamic extremism, it may be that."
for,"I think it's important that the Syrian -- the 100,000 Syrian refugees that come in be screened for security, obviously. I've emphasized that tonight. Second, I think it's important for the audience to understand that the vast majority of Syrian refugees that are coming in -- the vast majority -- are women and children under the age of 17. So, David's argument about the second generation I do find interesting. I do. I keep thinking, however, of people like St even Jobs, who was a second -generation Syrian refugee from the city of Homs. I keep thinking about comedians, Seinfeld show. Seinfeld himself was second -generation Syrian refugee.  It's not to say that every Syrian refugee is going to become -- or their children are going to become entertainers and brilliant -- -- no, but I'm making a serious point. But America is not just a humanistic country, in terms of our values, but it's also a place of opportunity. And so, I know what David said about the Somalis in Maine. Well, you know what? I live in New England now. And Maine in general -- the economy in Maine is pretty depressed. And the Somalis didn't cause that. Forces well outside the control of the local Somali community caused the problems in Maine. So, in a sense, I don't think that D avid's argument about second generation or third generation makes a lot of sense unless you look at a bigger context. Well, maybe this is an area where Europe has got something to teach America. I think America has a lot to teach Europe about how it can bring in refugees. I think when it comes to bringing up the fl oor in society, many people would see that in Europe, there's a lot to be taught the other way. And I think that the -- anyone who's traveled across the U.S. or anyone who's followed American politics and f ollowed the debate over 50 years about the so -called war on p overty can see that the case you make for attention for incredibly large numbers of people in the U.S. -- frankly, a lot of people in New York. I lived in New York for two years. I'm shocked by t he number of people on the streets. I walk my kids to school every morning. I'm shocked by how many people are on the streets. I don't think those -- you should ask the refugees to pay the price of sorting out those people. I think America can deal with it s own social problems at home while spending, frankly, a minuscule amount of mone y, relatively speaking. America spends 0.21 percent of it's national income, 0.2 1 percent of its national income on overseas aid. The sums that we are talking about, 1.4 cents per person, per American per day to resettle 100,000 refugees -- I think it allows you to say those social problems can be addressed. They don't have to be addressed at the expense of the role that you play in the world and the example that you can play, and the contribution that these people can make."
against,-- not by Uncle Sam.
for," Jessica said reality. So, here's another reality. Their idea of giving more money to Jordan, to Turkey, to Lebanon to pay for refugees -- you know what the reality is? Those countries don't want more refugees. Let me say that again. Those countries don't wantmore refugees. One out of every five people living inside Lebanon right now is a refugee. 10 percent of the population of Jordan now are refugees. The fifth largest city in Jordan is the Za atari Refugee Camp. King Abd ullah of Jordan was just here yest erday, does not want more refugees. They don't want our money. What they want is for the world, including the United States, to take more refugees. Okay, well, let me -- I will. So -- -- Jessica wrote a very interesting assessment, and there was a link in it to a Health and Human Services Department report about Iraqi refugees in the United States. Jessica is right that refugees when they come here do depend heavily at the beginning on government assistance. That is -- I would not argue that at all. What I would also say though is America is a lan d of opportunity. In the case of Iraqis, according to HHS, Health and Human Services statistics, 13, 1 -3 percent of Iraqis in 2009 depended only on their own income to live. Everybody else, the other 87 percent, depended to some extent or another on publ ic assistance. However, four years later, which is the last year of data for HHS, the number had gone from 13 percent to 40 percent. And the conclusion of the analysis was over time Iraqi refugees become less and less dependent on public ass istance. Does it require more resources up front? Yes, it does. But they're talking about more resources, too. They just want to give it to governments that the reality is won't take it because they don't want more refugees. By the way, today -- -- there are 16,000 Syrian refugees --John Donvan: Robert, I -- Robert -- Robert -- -- waiting at the border to go into Jordan --"
against,"I would say we should learn from our most recent experience with this kind of resettlement, the Somali case, 100,000 people there, again. It's not just in Maine. It's also in Minnesota, a very prosperous state, where the unemployment rate among Somalis is triple that of the rest of the state. The people -- the results of the policy -- the migration depend on the people you take. It is not always the same. Sometimes you have success. Sometimes you fail. Choose wisely.  Your time is up. David Miliband."
for,"America is stronger when it lives up to its values. And when there is dissonance between its values and its actions, then it causes trouble for itself and it causes trouble around the world. America's values point absolutely clearly to retaining this as a society that isn't a free -for -all. The people come here under conditions, that they obey the rules, that they live up to the social regulations that exist, but they're able to make their way. And you build the most productive and patriotic citizenry as a result. It's hugely in America's interest to make this , 100,000 Syrians , a home for t hem."
against,"Not only is it not in our national interests because of the enormous and unacceptable security risk and enormous and unacceptable cost of taking in 100,000 Syrian refugees, it's not in the best interest of the Syrian population either, because taking on that responsibility means that we are turning our back on so many other Syrians in Syria."
for,"It's in America's interest. We can do it safely, we can do it securely, and the record shows that. It's in America's interest because we are locked in a really tough battle against the Islamic State and Islamic terrorism, and we need to fight the perception that we are against Muslims. And, finally, both sides in t his debate are saying there are going to be costs, but we're saying that the costs will work better -- -- doing it this way and bringing in the 100,000 refugees. Oh, really? Oh, I was looking at that clock. We heard a lot of statistics tonight, but actually this motion is about people. It's about family's who've lost husbands and sons. It's about children who've lost parents. And it's about families who've lost the hope that they'll ever be a chance for them to rebuild their lives. I meet these families. We serve them every day, including those who are trying -- who arrive in the United States destined for a state and the governor -- a state in the U.S. and the governor says they can't go there. They stop in New York City. I saw -- I met that f amily last month. That family w as running a realty business in Deraa where the civil war started. One of the cousins got hit by an Assad barrel bomb. The daughter is still in Deraa and the day before I met that family the Russians had dropped a bomb nex t door to her. If you are going to vote against the motion tonight, you'regoing to have to be willing to tell that family that you don't want them in your country and I think those people have a right -- deserve the opportunity to come to this country. I believe that in the course of what has been a very good discussion, the case against the motion has crumbled. Has a Syrian ever been arrested on terrorism charges in the United States? A Syrian refugee.  Can the U.S. choose who it takes ?  Is the U.S. situation comparable to that in Europe?  And does a vote against the motion play into division hatred and fear? Of course it does. It's obvious. And as a father of two young boys, as a leader of a charity that works to help boy s just like them escape from terrorism, and as a great admirer of America, I ask you to support this motion not because it will make you feel good, but because it's right, because it's practical, and because it's a smart thing to do, just the same qualitie s that make America great today and the qualities that will make America great tomorrow. So with head and heart support the motion that will give 100,000 people a chance to rebuild their lives."
against,"I end as I began. By reminding us of the terrible humanitarian crisis that the planet faces. And we have offered you a choice of how to respond to it. One way multiplies your purchasing power by 12 or 13 times. Every dollar you spend in the United States is worth 12 or 13 dollars if spent in the region. That is a miraculous return. What you are being asked to do by those who urge you to vote for this resolution is to ignore that fact, but that's not the only fact they're asking you to ignore. They' re asking you to ignore what is going on right now in Germany. That's not relevant. They're asking you to ignore the experience of the Somalis, which were the last large scale resettlement from this part of the world. That's not relevant. They're asking you to look only at the 400 -- the examples of the 415 Syrians that David Miliband's group has so well resettled, and to ignore what is likely to happen as the population grows bigger. They are saying what is happening with asylum seekers is not relevant to thinking about what happens with refugees. They're saying, ""Don't think about the next generation. Don't think about what is going to happen with the adjustment pol icy.   Look at the image. See what's on TV and act accordingly."" You know, I strongly believe we owe a duty to humanity. And I think we ought to act on it. I believe Americans also owe their first duty to their country and their fellow cit izens, and what they need. But what I believe, most fundamentally, in every decision, is that we owe our highest duty to reason and judgment. If you are making decisions because of something you saw, a picture you saw -- something you saw on TV, you are making decisions wrong. You're doing violence to the whole idea of democracy and the reasoning process. I ask you to think. I ask you to say, ""I can multiply my good deed by 12 or 13. I can see what is happening in Germany. I remember our experience."" And therefore, I ask you to vote no to this resolution."
for,"Please remember, we're not talking about a process like in Germany. It's a very different thing. There aren't boat people coming to the United States from Syria the way they are in Europe. So, the German example is very different. This is a controlled pipeline of people that are given security screenings even right before they got on the airplane. David and Jessica have said, ""Well, we nee d to pay the countries where the refugees are now, out in the region, to stay there."" The reality is -- let me underline this -- Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq do not want to keep taking more, and more, and more refugees. They want help with resettlement. T hat's where American leadership comes in. Wedon't take all of them. But we take 100,000. We leverage that to get the Europeans to take more. Let's try to get Gulf countries to take more. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates. Let's get some Asian countries to take some. This is about leadership. I want to emphasize that over time, the experience with Iraqis is that they become less and less dependent on public assistance. I'm sensitive to the argument they make. But again, this is about v alues. America is a land of opportunity. Will there be more resource s expended when we're bringing refugees? Yes, there will be. But they're talking about trying to spend more in the region. I'm telling you, that won't work. And so, it's better to bring th em here. And over time, they will become less and less dependen t. Finally, as Kaitlyn mentioned -- I'm so glad this debate was in New York -- the Statue of Liberty is out in New York Harbor. If you believe what's written on the Statute of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your homeless, your tempest tos sed"" -- if you think that's what America is -- and I do -- then please vote for the resolution."
against," We've heard some passionate and compassionate arguments from both sides tonight. But we need to remember -- I don't want our government -- and I don't think you want our government to make policy on the basis of a poem. I want it to make policy on the basis of a real sound analysis of the situation and our options, okay? In addition our debate on the facts and costs, we've also heard people talk about people. And I want to close and ask you to think about a person that I read about today on my way here. Here name is Seren a. She' s a Syrian woman. Lives there. The headline of the article about Seren a is ""Woman Recalls Week Surrounded by Starvation and Suffering in the Sy rian Town."" It's not correct to say that the U.N. only wants us to resettle refugees. It is desperately seeking money it’s in the midst of a fundraising campaign to try to raise $9 billion to help the millions of Syrians who are in Syria. The story talks about the lives of people and how they're literally starving. People are literally dropping dead b ecause there is no food. Sere na’s husband was killed. He was fighting for an Islamist radical group. She lives with her daughter, her grandparents, her brothe r's family, and her mo ther in an apartment. And what I want to a sk you is, should we pluck Ser ena out of Syria and help just her? Or would it be better to help her entire family in Syria? Which makes more sense, for the money that we can allocat e to this problem? To help 100,000 Syrians by bringing them here or to help 1.2 million Syrians in Syria by giving the U.N. the money that it is asking for and desperately needs to help more Syrians in Syria. Think about that. That's why you need to say, "" No"" to bringing 100,000 Syrian refugees here. I'm starting to worry about hanging chads or something."
