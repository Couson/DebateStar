for,"Thank you, John. Thank you, Bloomberg. Thank you, NPR and thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz. Look, we have a double challenge today in America. One is the need to compete in a global economy, an economy that has changed hugely even as many of us have been wrestling with it. Number two, we have the effects of the global recession: state and local budgets that are totally and completely decimated right now. And so when the investment is very, very bleak, as it is right now, and the need is very, very great, it's no wonder that people are looking to find one entity to blame. But my friends, blaming unions for school failure is like blaming the middle class for the recession. Ultimately what humans do -- what our union does proudly is have a mantra. What is good for kids and what is fair for teachers. Now, am I saying that everything we've ever done is the right thing? Absolutely not. Am I saying that we are perfect? Absolutely not. But what we are trying to do in this very, very turbulent time is search for what works. Search for what works for kids. Let me ask -- let me suggest this. If teachers unions were to be blamed for failing schools, then we would assume that schools in less unionized states would outperform schools in more densely unionized states. So you'd assume that places like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, who have relatively few unionized teachers would do much, much better. But that's not the case. The states with the most densely unionized teachers, Massachusetts, New York, Maryland; they do the best. And the countries with the most densely unionized populations: Finland, Japan, they do the best. So what do we learn from that? What we know is that there are problems like Mr. Rosenkranz said. There are problems we have to solve. One of which is poverty. States like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi; they have and had been plagued by tremendous poverty. We have to compete with poverty. That's what public education is and that is what the search we have for, that's what our search is, to find what works. So you felt, I hope tonight we can move from scapegoating to solutions, to problem solving. And I would argue to all of you that having a strong union, someone in an entity that will look at what it's done right and what it's done wrong, and solve things and change things, is the way to go. So what works? What can we learn from places like Maryland, Massachusetts, New York State, Finland, and Japan? This is what we can learn. This is what works. What works in places where we don't as Terry Moe will probably argue, where we don't have niche markets, where we can't marketize our schools, where we have to help all kids. So we need well-prepared and supported teachers. We need well-rounded rigorous curriculum that engages kids and we can get our arms around. We need to invest in the tools and the time to differentiate instruction. We also need things like early childhood education and a focus and fixation on graduation in terms of high school. And finally, we need good services to help level the playing field for kids. Now, is this a panacea? Is this something that has never happened and it's a search for something we don't know how to find?  We find these elements in lots of different places. And the glue that binds us together, the difference between the places that work and the places that don't are good labor management relationships. Like we see in one of my other panelists here, in the ABC school district in California which has lifted its scores, which has changed its relationships from competitive to ones that are collaborative. Does that mean as I said before that we've done everything. Of course not. Everyone has to take more responsibility in this day and age. If we're going to ensure that all kids are ready for life, for college, for career, that means that -- that means we all have to take collective responsibility. And we, at the A.F.T., attempted to do that in any number of ways: first, in pushing for common standards, including the new common core curriculum or the common core standards in pushing for better aligned assessments, in pushing for better curriculum. And in looking at ourselves and saying look, we have to have a new approach to due process. We can't have rubber rooms anymore. We can't have a choice between off with your heads and warehousing. We can't have situations where if there is incompetence in the classroom we allow that to happen. We have to have more evaluation systems that are fair, that are meaningful, that are competent, and that actually help teachers teach in a more robust way than they may be doing now. But we also have to give teachers the tools and the time and the conditions that they need to do a good job with kids. Because at the end of the day, to compete with poverty, to drift all boats, to make sure that kids get that chance to dream their dreams and to achieve it, it comes with initially that connection between teacher and kid. That connection we made every day that we teach. That connection I made with my kids at Clara Barton High School that I know Gary made when he taught. I know Kate made when she teaches. We need teachers to have the support of the people around us and the unions. The unions -- all of us. The unions will do everything in their power to help fight for the tools and the conditions that teachers need and to fight to ensure that every kid, every kid gets a well prepared and well supported teacher. ",1.0
against,"Only 20 years.  It's great to be here. I want to thank Intelligence Squared for arranging this event and for putting the spotlight on what, in my view, is the most important issue in American education today, the power of the teachers unions. I should be clear that our team is not saying that the teachers unions are responsible for every problem of the public schools. What we are saying is that the unions are and have long been major obstacles to real reform in the system. And we're hardly alone in saying this. If you read “Newsweek,” “Time Magazine,” the “Washington Post,” lots of other well-respected publications, they're all saying the same thing: that the teachers unions are standing in the way of progress. So look. Let me start with an obvious example. The teachers unions have fought for all sorts of protections in labor contracts and in state laws that make it virtually impossible to get bad teachers out of the classroom. On average, it takes two years, $200,000, and 15% of the principal's total time to get one bad teacher out of the classroom. As a result, principals don't even try. They give 99% of teachers -- no joke -- satisfactory evaluations. The bad teachers just stay in the classroom. Well, if we figure that maybe 5% of the teachers, that's a conservative estimate, are bad teachers nationwide, that means that 2.5 million kids are stuck in classrooms with teachers who aren't teaching them anything. This is devastating. And the unions are largely responsible for that. They're also responsible for seniority provisions in these labor contracts that among other things often allow senior teachers to stake a claim to desirable jobs, even if they're not good teachers and even if they're a bad fit for that school. The seniority rules often require districts to lay off junior people before senior people. It's happening all around the country now. And some of these junior people are some of the best teachers in the district. And some of the senior people that are being saved are the worst.  So just ask yourself, would anyone in his right mind organize schools in this way, if all they cared about was what's best for kids? And the answer is no. But this is the way our schools are actually organized. And it's due largely to the power of the unions. Now, these organizational issues are really important, but they're just part of a larger set of problems. Our nation has been trying to reform the schools since the early 1980s. And the whole time the teachers' unions have used their extraordinary power in the political process to try to block reform and make sure that real reform just never happens. Consider charter schools. There are many kids around this country who are stuck in schools that just aren't teaching them. They need new options. Well, charter schools can provide them with those options. But charter schools are a threat to teachers' unions. If you give kids choice and they can leave regular public schools, then they take money and they take jobs with them. And that's what the teachers' unions want to stop. So what they've done is they've used their power in the political process to put a ceiling on the numbers of charter schools. As a result in this country today, we have 4,600 charter schools. There are like well over 90,000 public schools. So this is a drop in the bucket. And mean time charter schools have huge waiting lists of people who are desperate to get in. In Harlem, for example, the charter schools there got 11,000 applications for 2,000 slots recently. So just to give you an idea of about how the politics of this works out, in Detroit a few years ago, a benefactor came forth and said he was willing to donate $200 million to set up additional charter schools for the kids in Detroit who obviously need it. What did the union do? The union went ballistic. They shut down the schools, went to Lansing, demonstrated in the state capitol and got the politicians to turn down the $200 million for those kids. This is good for kids? I don't think so. This is about protecting jobs. The same kind of logic applies with accountability. Accountability is just common sense. We obviously need to hold schools and teachers accountability for teaching kids what they're supposed to know. But the teachers' unions find this threatening. They say they support accountability but they don't want teachers held accountable. Any sensible effort to hold teachers accountable, they brand as scapegoating teachers. They don't even want teachers performance to be measured. Right here in New York City, Joel Klein indicated a while ago that he was going to use student test scores as one factor in evaluating teachers for tenure. What did the union do? Now, this is something that Obama supports, that Arne Duncan supports. It's unbelievable. What the union did is they went to Albany and they got their friends in the legislature to pass a law making it illegal to use student test scores in evaluating teachers for tenure anywhere in the state of New York. It's just outrageous. And makes no sense from the standpoint of what's best for kids. The “New York Times” called it absurd. This is how the unions approach accountability. Okay, well, I don't have a whole lot of time left here. So let me just quickly say our opponents are going to say tonight, and Randi has already said, there is really no conflict between standing up for the jobs of teachers and doing what's best for kids. But the thing is there is a conflict. And that's why we can't get bad teachers out of the classroom, because they protect them. That's why the schools have totally perverse organizations imposed on them, and that's why totally sensible reforms are seriously resisted in the political process. Now, what you're going to hear, I'm sure, throughout the evening is that union leaders and unions around the country, they're actually reformers too. They want to get bad teachers out of the classroom. They say they're for charter schools; they're all in favor of accountability. Well, not really. Talk is cheap. What counts is what they actually do. And what they do is to oppose reform. This is the reality. ",1.0
for," I teach children and teachers, kindergarten through fourth grade. Good evening, everyone. I too, would like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation especially for having a teacher come and speak because it is a rare occasion for a teacher to actually be able to talk about education. It's usually think tanks and professors and others. So I'm really privileged to be here tonight.  The first time I heard about this, don't blame teachers' unions, I, too, thought like Randi. I'm from the common wealth of Massachusetts. Which I'm very proud to say is number one in the country. Our students perform higher than anybody else in this country academically. Yet we have the strongest collective bargaining rights in the country. So do me it just doesn't add up. And then I started thinking I'm also a doctoral student so I'm trying to learn as much as I can about research and so the next thing I did is I went straight to the literature. Even Professor Moe said publications are all saying the same thing. There is no research to support what he is saying. There is no research out there that correlates student achievement to collective bargaining rights to teach unionism, either for or against. There is no conclusive evidence so people can say what they want. And publicize. It doesn't mean that it's research-based. So with that, what do collective bargaining rates do to improve schools? And I have a lot to say. Not only am I a teacher, I'm the executive vice-president of the United Teachers of Lowell, and I deal with this firsthand as a union leader. And for me, what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to provide dignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot. And the way that we can do that is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers, but also for children. So one example of that, which unfortunately in my district -- my union has not been able to negotiate yet; is something like we could have language for class sizes. So early childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is good for them, but that's a way we can ensure it, by having it in the teachers' contract. That's just one example. The other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a local level is it ensures academic freedom. What that means is there are times as a teacher that I need to advocate for the child. And that means I have to say something unpopular, something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent, and I need to be able to do that, to be the best teacher that I can be. And I need to be able to do that without fear. And that is why collective bargaining rights are very important when you are in a classroom, you need to be able to do what you know is best for children. And that is why it's important. Besides families, no one cares more about students and their learning, especially students living in poverty, than their teachers. And what the teachers' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers. So while my opponents on the motion might say that I have my own agenda, I would argue that is absolutely not true. My agenda is the agenda of the teachers. What the teachers need. So the way that we find that out at a local level, the president of our union and the superintendent, along with other members of the executive board go to the schools and meet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done. We survey our members. And what they need in their classrooms is our agenda. So for example one thing that we've done is we've created what's been called -- the Department of Education in Massachusetts has been called the Cadillac teacher induction program. So the union and management sat down together, that's the union-initiated protocol, to make sure that every teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor. They have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so that they can best meet our students in Lowell who often come with second language issues, they have full training in what they need. Also with that, the mentors are trained to talk to their mentees about whether they're in the right place or not. And to counsel them perhaps out of urban education, if that's not what's meeting their need or meeting the children's need. And also, to help them make better choices. Another thing that was union initiated that is in our contract, we call the Lowell program. It's an in-house graduate program where teachers can get their master's degree. Again, the superintendent and her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is, and we work together so that teachers are given the tools that they need. In terms of evaluations, our evaluation procedures in Lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what's required by state standard. So our new teachers are evaluated twice every year, whereas the state only mandates once. So in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures, it's just not true. The most important thing in my opinion about what we've done -- and I can't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately, I was only in high school, but I can speak to what's happening in schools now. And what we are doing is this labor management union. Because with all due respect, we have been -- the teachers have been told what to do. We've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants and under these grants, and we found -- the teachers found they were not working for children. We've told what to do. Now what we need to do is have a seat at the table to be part of the decision making. And so in Lowell we have begun this journey to build collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the people at the ground floor, the teachers, can inform the decisions that are made for children. So it is, indeed, what is best for them. ",1.0
against,"I knew that was going to come up. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here to convince you to vote against this proposition. All of us know that teachers are not solely to blame for our failing schools. But they bear significant responsibility and the way this is framed, the only way to express that is to vote against this proposition. Now, to understand my point of view, you have to realize how powerful these organizations are. To be blunt, teachers unions represent the most dominant political force in American education. We're not talking about little wimpy organizations. We're talking about mammoth highly financed, highly organized, highly peopled organizations. And political dominance is not something that they got unintentionally. They intended to be politically dominant. Here is a quote from Sam Lambert in 1967 about NEA. NEA would become the political -- become a political power second to no other special interest group. Listen to those words. People could argue now that they've already reached that goal. Teacher unions represent the number one political spender in the United States of America. In the state of California, the NEA spent more in the last decades than any other political spender and the second political spender spent less by a little bitter than 1/2 of what the NEA spent. These are powerful, dominant organizations. The NEA has 3.2 million members, 14,000 locals across the United States, and last year -- in 2007 they collected about $400 million from their members to supplement the other revenue streams that they had. The AFT is not a slouch either. They have 1.4 million members, 300 locals across the United States. And they're active in 43 states. NEA has state offices in every state in the United States. And that's not all. They can call on their political partners when they get in trouble. They can call on the AFL-CIO. They can call on Acorn. They can call on People for the American Way. They can call on the Center for Community Change. These are mammoth organizations and I need for you to understand that in order to understand why we take this position. Now, the American workforce, about 12% of the workforce is unionized. But in the education profession, it's 38%. Teachers' unions literally have our schools in a chokehold. This is completely dangerous. Now, power corrupts. Total power corrupts totally. You need to be clear about how they use this power. To try to convince people -- you heard a lot tonight about children and their members. Don't be fooled. Organizations have one primary interest. They may have some other interests but they have one main interest. Teachers' unions’ main interest is the welfare of their members. Another quote from NEA operative, “The main purpose of our association” -- note the word association. They don't even call themselves unions. It’s not the education of children, but rather it is all to be the extension and preservation of our members' rights. Now, that's just a statement of fact. Organizations can't serve 2 gods, little “g.” They serve one. And in the case of teachers' unions, it is the interests of their members. Now, let me tell you a live story. In 2000, a Buffalo school district had about 7,000 members and they were the most unionized public school system in the United States of America. And 7:00 a.m., on a school day, the leaders of the teachers' unions still on the Buffalo headquarters step called a strike at 7:00 a.m. on a school day. Now, many children already are on buses on the way to school. Many parents have already dropped kids off at school leaving their kids in the love care of teachers.  Does that sound like an organization that cares about kids? They were arguing for employee rights. Two more major points that really tick me off to some extent. Teachers unions are sitting on both sides of the negotiating table in many cases. They -- teachers unions work with school boards so that they have representatives on the school boards. When I served as superintendent of Houston, one of my nine school board employees, actually an employee of the teachers unions, fortunately for me, both were reasonable people and we got along rather well. But many school district superintendents don't have that luxury. They have school -- they have school boards that have teachers unions representatives sitting on that side of the table; the unions sitting on this side of the table. They're negotiating with themselves. They're sitting on both sides of the negotiating table. Here is the worst thing, I think, that really fires me up. Teachers unions have awesome power to cause action in schools. They have zero responsibility for their student performance. That's just not fair. That's not fair. It handicaps the principals and the superintendents who are operating with both hands tied behind their back. The teachers unions are calling the rules. They're responsible for student achievement. That's no way to run a ship. And it simply will not work that way. Now, here again, I want to be honest and I want to be fair. We can't solely blame teachers unions for these complex issues we have in our school situation but they do bear significant responsibility. And the only way you can express that is to vote against this motion to indicate that we are the nation. If we're going to really reform our schools, we're going to have to wind back from the power of teachers unions. We can still have teachers unions. We're not arguing that we shouldn't have teachers unions. Our schools are over unionized and consequently reform has run into a road block. ",1.0

against,"I'm glad Gary brought up Mr. Shanker, because he is alleged to have said when school children start paying dues, that's when I'll start representing them. Now, I don't know if he did say that. Some people think he did, some say no. But that has been the teacher's union attitude ever since I began my teaching career here in New York City in 1971. In educating children, there is nothing more valuable than a dedicated and gifted teacher and nothing more harmful and destructive than a bad one. And it's those teachers, the mediocre and the incompetent ones that the unions typically represent. In fact, they punish good teachers in numerous ways. Unions insist that school districts not pay good teachers what they're worth. They insist on an archaic factory model of payment whereby teachers make more money by years on the job -- not productive years, just by calendar progression. Consider the greatest teacher of our time, Jaime Escalante, subject of the film “Stand and Deliver,” now unfortunately near death in his native Bolivia; attracted national attention at Garfield high school in Los Angeles with his spectacular success teaching college level calculus to gang members and other unteachables. Talk about poor students. What was the problem? Because he was willing to have more students in his class than the United Teachers of Los Angeles contract allowed for, he was basically run out of town by that union. When there are layoffs due to budget cuts, do the worst teachers get laid off?  Do the permanents or tenure, a union must in every contract, the newest hires are let go. You're a teacher of the year? Too bad. You're double test scores? Too bad. But the unions will go to any length, any length to save the job of a bad tenured teacher. If you think I'm exaggerating, here is a quote from an LA union rep. If I'm representing them it's impossible to get them out. It's impossible unless they commit a lewd act. End quote. And maybe not even then. You're laughing. This is a true story and this didn't happen very long ago. Was a former colleague, he's alleged to have touched a female student inappropriately. There are witnesses. The female student would not press charges. So they put X into the district office for a while, the so-called rubber room, which probably most of you know of. They decided to put him, by the union lore, they put him in another school. He apparently did the same thing. Back to the rubber room: sitting, sitting. Finally, one day, I guess he got bored. He decided to bring porn to the district office, the rubber room. He got caught. With the union lawyers’ help, he got put back into a school, another school, the third school now. And in short order, he got caught showing his female students some of his pornography collection. The last I heard he's back in a district office waiting for his union lawyer to make the next move. This is the kind of guy that really needs the union. Not a dedicated teacher. Not an honest teacher here. This is the kind of guy who really needs the union. By the way, the guy I'm talking about, Mr. X. is really a pussy cat compared to some of the teachers you have in New York. Just reading some things about a -- I'm only saying his name because it's in the newspapers, Francisco Olivares, who impregnated one of his students and his still on the payroll. Another instance of my middle school involved a teacher who decided to sunbathe topless on the athletic field at lunch. It was a nice spring day. What happened? With the union's help, she was put back into school in an elementary school this time. Once again, a union rep in his own words, “I've gone in and defended teachers who shouldn't even be pumping gas.” Not my quote. This is a union rep. That's the mentality. Unions today function more like criminal lawyers than partners in education reform. Very importantly, too, the unions love the status quo and will fight to keep it. In California recently, education reformer, Bill Evers was attacked by a local union for trying to get Singapore math a new and innovative way of teaching a subject, but because learning all the different things you had to do to teach this was a little bit too much for some of the teachers, the unions decide to kill it. Very importantly, the unions are constantly trying to limit the number of charter schools. “The Cartel,” an excellent film by Bob Bowden, about public education has one of the most affecting scenes I've ever seen on film. It shows parents and children waiting to see if they won the lottery. That is if they got into the charter school. If charter schools have more children than seats available, very simply they'll hold a lottery. And in this scene the camera goes into -- close on the faces of the children and the parents who are winning the lottery and getting to the charter school and they're thrilled and you feel happy for them. And then they go into the people who didn't win, and these people are crying and sad and you feel horrible for them: very affecting scene. But these tears of joy and anger -- tears of joy and sadness turn to anger because you realize the unions are constantly fighting the establishment of charter schools as the UTLA did just about two weeks ago in Los Angeles. They were very successful at killing charter schools. Another abominable example, I'm going to speak a little quickly because I'm running out of time. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, it was created to rescue at least some children from the horrible school district, Washington D.C. We spent $27,000 per student. Probably the worst school system in the country. 1,700 kids, mostly poor, mostly black, won the lottery which gave them a $7,500 scholarship to get into the best schools they could, private or parochial. The program was a great success. The kids looked forward to going to school for the first time. They thrived. The parents were happy. The taxpayers saved money. The only ones not happy were the unions who cannot abide any competition for the government run monopolies, even though it has been shown that when school choice exists, public schools improve. I will close with a quote from Ron Williams who said about this situation, “The NEA seems far more devoted to its members than they are of the children they teach. It doesn't seem to bother them that they continue to fail the nation's most vulnerable children.” Amen to that, Mr. Williams. ",1.0

What we want to do is we want charters to be held to the same accountability standards including the ones that we started, as any other school and what the evidence has been in New York, like the evidence around the country, is that charter schools instead of, as Diane Ravitch said, should take more of the most at-risk kids are actually taking fewer special needs kids and fewer kids with limited English proficiency.

There are major issues about the funding that comes with it. But when we speak it up, we're somehow obstructionist. That is not the case.

against,"Go see Bob Bowden’s film. You tell me those parents and those kids are the cream. These are poor people. Maybe they're the cream of the poor people.  I'd be happy to respond, but I don't know where this stuff comes from, really. Look, many, many, many, many factors influence student achievement. And to say basically that schools in the South don't do as well as schools in the North, which is true, and that schools in the South don't have unions and the schools in the North do, and to say, gee whiz, it must be because unions are good for schools. I -- don't try that at a university. It doesn't wash. So, look, as far as the research goes, I don't know where Kate's getting this. I mean, there is a research literature. Actually, it's pretty big on the impact of collective bargaining on student achievement. She says there's nothing. There is, plenty. It started sort of back in the 1980s. Most of the literature I think is not good. But that's typical of most of social science. A lot of this stuff is bad. And part of the reason is that things are complicated. It's very hard to do good studies. So you can't just like count up studies. The results in this literature are pretty mixed. And I think it's partly because, A, it's complicated, and B, a lot of the studies don't do it very well. But there are two studies that are actually in very top-level journals, they have been through very rigorous peer review process. They are one by Caroline Hoxby in the “Quarterly Journal of Economics,” 1996. Another one is by me in -- Yeah, this -- it's a lot better than Caroline's. And it is in the “American Journal of Political Science,” 2009. Both these studies show, through a quantitative analysis, both of them very extensive, that the impact of collective bargaining on student achievement is negative.",2.0
for,"So, Terry, you've actually just made the point that I think many of us are trying to make on this side, which is it is complicated. There is not one factor that either causes student success or -- or is an obstacle to it. And that's exactly what we are trying to say. So ultimately, just like we did not say that teacher unions were the reason why Maryland or Massachusetts or New York were so successful -- and by the way, that was just in quality counts from education week. We were not the ones that said that Finland or Japan were most successful. We're just saying that those are the correlations. Now, there is one person who used to actually agree with you hugely Diane Ravitch who, in looking at much of the evidence over the course of time, whether it was on charters or whether it was on vouchers has thrill just written a book saying slow down. The evidence of these kinds of market strategies just doesn't work. My point is this: Whether you look at -- everyone is going to find anecdotes to fit into their case. That's not going to help one more child learn. We are searching for what actually works. So regardless of the quotes when they hurl at me from the NEA or from other places, I stand by the record that we have in turning around schools in New York City. Mr. Rudy Crew, who is sitting there, and I, together did probably the most important reform strategy in New York in the late 1990s, early 2000, where we actually turned around schools in Harlem. We turned around schools in New York City. We want to make sure every single child has a choice. Once they have a choice for a charter, so be it. But every child should have a choice for a neighborhood high school or a neighborhood school. And Larry, last point to you, which is this: Just recently, unlike what you said about LA, in LA, there were 36 schools that were put up for grabs by the LA school board. The charters love this. They wanted this competition. And in that competition, regular school teachers, supported by their union, won 29 of the 36 schools because of their plans. The bottom line is we need to do the things that Gary and Kate talked about in terms of helping all kids, well prepared and supported teachers, real engaged curriculum, safe and orderly environments which is what we see in charter schools all the time, good, good management that works together. And at the end of the day, if we have to find ways, as I said in 2004, to police our own profession, fire teachers that are not making the grade, we want to do that. That's who this teachers union is. We want the best and the brightest for all of our young people in this country.   I taught for 14 years -- -- and never did I grade a test or work with my class thinking that-- about my standing in the teachers' union. That doesn't even go through your mind. I would agree that teachers unions don't rank teachers, but neither do administrators. There's no ranking of teachers in any school by anybody. I don't even know if it's possible. I don't even know if it's desirable. It wouldn't be something I would recommend that management do or teachers unions do. I don't think it can be done. I don't think it necessarily should be done. There are a variety of factors. We've all had teachers that have been enormously successful with some folks and not very successful with others. You can't blame teachers unions for not ranking teachers because nobody ranks teachers like that. That's not true in my district. The changed their name from union rep to learning rep. And it's not -- The number one focus of the teachers' union and in the workshop where that was done, what they worked on, were all of the strategies and techniques to produce successful students. The number one job according to my union president of the union reps, the reps in my district, is student achievement. And we work together to do that. It's one of the most powerful forces in our district. I've had great administrators and they work with teachers to produce successful students. Why would you want it any other way? Fighting each other doesn't work. It's a dumb plan to fight each other and say, ""One side's going to win, and one side's going to lose."" I don't believe in that. You know you got to work together, and if you don't, it is never going to work. That side said that you never -- Secretary Paige said, ""You're never going to do away with teachers' unions.""  If that's the truth, then we'd better start working together or we're going to die together. I think if you look at the -- rather than -- Okay.",2.0
against,"Yeah, I just wanted to say that basically the teachers' unions don't want teacher performance to be measured, and they especially don't want any information to get out about how well teachers do. Actually the testing technology is quite sophisticated now. And it's possible, not just to do value added calculations for how much kids learn during a year but also to take into account, through statistical controls, student background characteristics, how much students know at the beginning of the year so that you can control for that, and so on. And so it is certainly possible to do these things in a very systematic and rigorous and fair way. And I think what we're going to be leading toward eventually, unless the teachers' unions are able to block it, is a system where we have information on teacher performance under a variety of conditions and we move towards transparency, where it is possible to let people know what teachers are good and what teachers are not good, because if teachers are not good, people should know that so that they don't put their kids in those classrooms.

And if you look at the three of us, and you actually listen to our members, you’re actually right. We are paid to listen to our members because very few other people actually do listen to the voices of teachers. There was a Gates study recently that said that of 40,000 teachers, that said that overwhelmingly what they wanted; number one issue is they wanted to be supported; they wanted to be respected. That is very similar to polling that we have taken of our members and very similar to what I see when I was a local union president, where we had the most extraordinary people in New York City teaching in our classrooms. What we see is that members by a four to one and five to one margin have said to us, they want us to fight for the tools and conditions they need to do their jobs. And ultimately, when we try to fight for budgets for schools, when we try to fight for equity; when we try to fight to ensure that class sizes are low and that they’re safe and reasonable environments for kids so that kids don’t get bullied, when in some ways we try to fight for the things that I know the Harlem parents have tried to fight for in the schools that they have.

They know who the poor teachers are. The other teachers know who the poor teachers are. Absolutely; they know who the bad teachers are too, there’s very much clear ranking.

Let me just say there was no attempt on any of our parts to either pack the audience or to give people invitations other than the six or ten that -- invitations that I received. So there's no -- there was no attempt to do any of that. Now, having said that -- Well -- it's not -- Well, but I think that the tone -- what I have experienced in terms of New York City is that in a -- most teachers right now, as we are speaking, are at home actually grading papers and marking lessons. And frankly, from my perspective when I was the teachers union president here, I never actually asked people to come or pack an audience or do these things, from my perspective. I can't talk for other than myself. In terms of the question about firing, what tends to happen in the teaching ranks is that there is a huge attrition rate of teachers. And so you have essentially half the new teachers within the first five to seven years actually leave the profession because it is such a tough, tough, tough place to work. And whether it's because they don't get the support that they need or a variety of other things, whether it's salaries or other things, what you see is that you use both the statistics of how many people have attrited out. And in New York City last year, my understanding was that about 30 to 40 percent of the teachers, or about 30 percent of the new teachers attrited out within the first five years in terms of firing on what the statistic is. But I will tell you, in terms of the peer intervention process and program that we started in 1987, first under my predecessor, Sandy Feldman and then myself, we actually counseled hundreds of teachers out of the profession who we thought, after we tried to help them, were not up to snuff.",2.0

But unfortunately with the high-stakes testing, the themes have gone to the wayside, and all of the well-meaning grants with mandates attached. So I can't speak to that. But the parents do have the choice. So I actually am a parent of a Lowell public school child. And I went to the central office and registered him. I put down my top three choices for schools, very much like what you're all advocating for. And that's our public school system, and that's all something our union supports. My district has -- -- 29 regular K-12, kindergarten, middle -- I mean elementary, middle and high school, one adult school. We're schools of choice. We have one-third of our schools are magnet schools. Parents can make choices. Every school in our district has a school site council where parents are represented.

I take total exception because my issue as a union leader about charter schools, if they are public schools, and this is my experience as a teacher, and hearing from the other teachers, why is it when a child needs an outside placement that costs over a hundred thousand dollars, the charter school sends them back to the public schools to pay for. If they are a public school, that is their student. They should support him. Unions -- Sorry. As a union leader, I see what collective bargaining does for a school in a school system.

Yesterday, March 15th was a day of reckoning for many teachers across the country. In a bad economy, that's when the letters of possible layoffs also known as RIFs, reduction in force notices, go out to all teachers -- go out to teachers who might be losing their job. In my school's retirement lunch last June -- there were more than retirees saying goodbye. We lost several of the hardest working, most effective and popular young teachers on campus. Several teachers -- we all know who they are. The kids know, the parents know, the teachers know -- should have been the ones saying goodbye.

Now some teachers unions aren't modern. But those that are do these things. It is implied that the teachers union or non-unionon is the only veritable here. And they've tried to use weasel words to get out of that. Oh, not all of them or some of them. But the case is if you look at the proposition, you have to blame teachers unions, I guess in each and every case. You have to deny poverty, poor budgets, lack of parental support, poor boards, poor state leadership, poor superintendent. You have to say none of those things count and only teachers union counts. They know that's not true, and they've said so. So you can't blame -- just blame teachers unions. And you know that. There's a lot reasons schools don't work. And it's not just teachers unions. Professor Moe said that teachers unions are major obstacles to school improvement.  Not in my district. So the proposition isn't true in my district. It isn't true in Kate's district. It isn't true in a lot of districts. And you've got to be fair about that. It's not true in a lot of school districts. Professor Moe pointed out that principals, 90 percent of them said they can't get rid of bad teachers. That's not a very good system. Why not work with teachers unions to get rid of bad teachers? That's what Randi Weingarten wants to do. Magnet schools work better than charters. I'm all for magnet schools. But the AFT's not against magnet -- charter schools, either. Larry Sand told us a lot of stories from band camp. I don't think that that's a good reason to say teachers unions are bad, by sharing horror stories from individual places throughout the United States.

Teacher unions draw the ability to serve, to protect the interest of their members from their ability to convince the public that they are really about the kids. They are very good at hiding their real intent. They draw their power and ability to get the public to believe that there are some persons in some groups that they are not. They are not who they say they are. Who they say they are is not who they really are.

That is the purpose of the United Teachers of Lowell. There are other aspects to what we do, yes. We protect due process rights, yes. That is one area.

The teachers unions are by far the most powerful groups in American education. And they use their power mainly to protect jobs. And what they say is that there is really no conflict between protecting jobs and doing what's best for kids. But there are conflicts, lots of them, and as a result we can't get bad teachers out of the classroom, the schools are burdened with truly perverse organizations, and fundamental reforms, good reforms that make sense for kids, are resisted and undermined and weakened. So these are just basic facts. Our opponents say that they want reforms too, that they want to get bad teachers out of the classroom. We've heard that several times that they want choice, that they want accountability, and my response is, ""Hey, it's 2010. Where’ve you been? If you wanted to get bad teachers out of the classroom, why didn't you do it 30 years ago? Why do we have all these protections and state laws? Why weren't they aggressive about it 30 years ago? Why are we even talking about it now?"" Same thing with choice and accountability, they could have been aggressive in supporting these things, pushing for more choice, pushing for accountability.

I think about the thousands and thousands of teachers who are isolated in individual classrooms and who, frankly, have no interest in the status quo and who join a union or stay in a union because they want voice in how their kids get a decent education.
