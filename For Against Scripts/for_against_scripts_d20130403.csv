for,"We need to abolish the minimum wage. And there's only one argument that matters on this issue, and it's the moral argument. Does the minimum wage make the world a better place? And does it improve or hurt the lives of the poorest American families and the workers who are in those families? Now, those Americans with the least education and the lowest skill levels have struggled tremendously over the last three decades. They find themselves in competition with machines, computers, automation, with foreign workers. Their job opportunities have shrunk. Their standard of living is mediocre at best, but the minimum wage is the wrong way to help those people. It attacks the effects of economic change rather than doing anything about the underlying causes. And by doing so, it hurts the people that we're trying to help. You don't need a special theory of the labor market or a degree in economics to understand that making workers artificially more expensive makes it harder for them to find work. Now, those who support the minimum wage will tell you it's necessary to create a level playing field between employers and employees, that workers need the bargaining power that they are -- that they're missing, and the minimum wage makes that up. But in reality, most of us don't need that extra help. 95 percent of workers who are paid the hourly wage, which is about 75 million Americans -- 95 percent of those make more than the minimum wage already. And that includes my cleaning lady, who I pay over two times the minimum wage. Now, why do I do that? Because I'm an incredibly nice person. Well, that's what I like to think. But I really know better, because I'm an economist. The reason I play my cleaning lady almost $20 an hour is because if I don't, she doesn't show up. She has other alternatives that she will turn to if I don't meet her market wage. It is those alternatives that protect her from the greed of employers. And alternatives force employers to treat employees well and most of us don't need legislation to protect us in the labor force. But the minimum wage does boost the salary of about 3.5 million Americans. About half of those, 1.7 million, are young people, 16 to 24. They get helped by the minimum wage as do those who make a little more than that, because it boosts the attractiveness of those workers relative to what it would otherwise be without the minimum wage. But those artificially high wages, that boost in wage discourages employers from hiring other workers who are low-skilled and have little experience. This is particularly tragic today, when the unemployment rate among 16-to 24-year-olds is 16 percent. And for African Americans -- young African Americans,it's over 29 percent. Almost one in three. Now, many who support the minimum wage will argue that somehow you could raise wages artificially and there'll be no net effect on employment. But who believes that employers don't respond to incentives to higher wages and try to find ways to save costs? That's why employers replace workers with machines. That's why they send factories overseas. And that's why manufacturing employment has been falling steadily in recent decades, not just as a proportion of the total, but in absolute numbers, because fewer and fewer low-skilled workers who used to do those jobs are needed to produce the goods that we still make and manufacture. And by the way, the U.S. manufacturing sector, in output terms, is thriving. But in employment terms, it's struggling. And those are the places that people without a college degree used to find a good job. Those opportunities are shrinking. Why would artificially increasing the wages of workers, especially those who don't go to college and who don't finish high school -- why would artificially increasing those wages make those workers better off? Why would it have no effect on their employment? Consider my favorite exemption to the minimum wage: the internship. The internship is a very special kind of violation of the minimum wage. You pay zero. You're allowed to pay zero. You're allowed to pay less than the minimum wage as long as it's zero. How strange is that? But we all understand that, for our kids, that's a glorious thing. It's what's needed because their skills aren't often worth $7.25 an hour, and we want them to get that experience at the bottom of their -- at the beginning, at the bottom of the economic scene, so they can get the experience, and the mentoring, and all the things that come with being in the workplace. And thank goodness that there is a special exemption for zero. Does anybody think that if we got rid of that, there'd be more opportunities for young people? Others justify the minimum wage by saying the effects are small -- the employment effects. Small? When you lose your job or can't find one, the effect isn't small, it's 100 percent. So it's nice to give 1.7 million young workers a raise, but what about the 3.4 million unemployed workers 16-to-24, last month, who can't find work? We're increasing the wages of 1.7 million and making it harder for 3.4 million to find work, twice as many. I don't accept that tradeoff. That's a tragedy. I reject it. It's a bad bargain. The irony of the minimum wage is that it reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom end. It reduces the number of opportunities they have while increasing the number of people who are trying to find them. The best argument for the minimum wage is thatour school system is a failure, so we have to do something to help those at the bottom. But this is the wrong way to fix it. It's an additional barrier to the least skilled workers of America, making it harder for them to find work, those who have the least education, the least ability, the fewest connections, the ones who desperately need that first job to start their career. I beg you to consider that the best intentions don't always lead to good results. Abolish the minimum wage. Let young people and the least skilled have a better chance of getting the experience they need to thrive and prosper. Thank you very much.",
against,"Well, I'm glad to see all of you here and that you've chosen this over other D.C. options you had tonight. You could be looking at the cherry blossoms or seeing the Nationals play, but you've come to talk and debate the minimum wage, so you're my kind of people. So I'm glad you're here. Here is my main point. Luckily, for our side, strongly against abolishing the minimum wage, almost everything you just heard from Russ is shown to be false by a large body of compelling research. So let me start with my main point. Abolishing the minimum wage would be a terrible policy mistake that would needlessly hurt millions of low wage workers. It's not a policy, this idea of abolishing the minimum wage. This policy is nowhere near the current agenda. In fact, as you've heard, the current debate asks whether the minimum wage should be increased. Now, it is true that during the Republican primary, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain endorsed the idea in the Republican primary of abolishing the minimum wage, but that idea of abolishing a policy that's been in place since the1930s, helping low wage workers, is about as far out of the mainstream as you can get, and let me explain why. Now, this gray hair I have, I got through a lifetime, as was mentioned earlier, of analyzing social and economic policies, beginning as a social worker in New York City with the poor, and I worked my way -- I don't want to say up, sideways, wherever it is I am now -- to whatever it is I'm doing today. And, you know, over those decades, I focused on two things, what's gone wrong in our economy and which policies could help give less advantaged folks a shot, a fair chance? It's through that simple agenda that decades ago I became interested in minimum wage policy. As globalization, and technological change, and a lot of other stuff that we can talk about throughout the evening have evolved, economic growth no longer reaches working families the way it used to. And the further you go down the pay scale, the less growth you're likely to see. The minimum wage partially helps offset that problem. And, in fact, you will be hard pressed to find a policy that does what it sets out to do, raising the pay of low wage workers, more effectively or more efficiently. And importantly, and this is why I stressed it when I started, and we'll have lots of time to get into this, I hope, reams of high quality research shows that it does so with the minimum of the type of side effects that you heard Russ emphasize. Consider this, just start here with a little commonsense thought experiment. The American minimum wage, as you've heard, has been in place since 1938, 75 years ago. It has been raised 22 times. Nineteen states now have their own minimum wages above the federal level. If this policy was so damaging, as damaging as Russ claims, that it needs to be abolished, how could it be that citizens and legislatures in 19 states decided not to abolish it, but to raise it above the federal level? If it was anywhere near as damaging as our opponents claim, how could the minimum wage not only have survived this long, but have flourished and expanded? The answer, once again, is because it's widely understood and accepted by mainstream economics, policymakers, and perhaps most importantly, low-wage workers themselves, who overwhelmingly support the policy -- that's very important, I'll come back to that -- as doing what it's supposed to do, steering a bit more of the economic growth their way. Now, to do what our opponents advocate, to get rid of the minimum wage, would figuratively take the wage floor out from under millions of low-wage workers, many of whom -- and Karen will emphasize these points -- depend on the minimum wage to support their families. =t's very misleading to say that this is just a teenagers’ issue. =t's not. For these reasons, as you've heard, the president has proposed an increase in thefederal -- in the federal minimum wage. Now, that's what we ought to actually be debating. I firmly believe that economists can and should have good, robust debates about that kind of a proposal -- should the minimum wage be increased or not? But that's not what we're arguing about. That's not what you're voting on on the resolution. Our opponents think that America should have no minimum wage at all. To me, a better question than that -- than the one on notice tonight, should be -- should the minimum wage be abolished? The better question is why anyone would even suggest such a bad idea? So, why would you -- why would you even think that? And I think the answer comes down to two factors. First, common misconceptions, ones that should have been banished by the research. And second, because of a laissez-faire market ideology that trumps common sense and empirical evidence. Now, a word about this evidence. There's probably no question that's been analyzed more carefully by economists than this one, about the impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers. And the conclusion is that it raises the pay of low-wage workers without hurting their jobs prospects. Of literally thousands of estimates on the impact of the minimum wage on job impacts of affected workers, the vast majority find that the benefits to low-wage workers -- the benefits to low-wage workers -- exactly the opposite of what's -- of what Russell claims -- the benefits for low-wage workers far outweigh any costs in terms of reduced hours or job loss. Now, recall that I mentioned all of these states with their own minimum wage levels exist. That's provided something that minimum wage researchers have found very rare in economics -- pseudo-experimentation. The best way to test the impact of an intervention like this is to compare places that are as like -- as -- in terms of economic variables as you can find. Yet, one has the economic intervention and the other doesn't. These studies, this pseudo-experimentation, comparing states and places across borders, have consistently found results, job loss effects, that hover around zero. Sometimes a little bit below. I will grant the other side that. Sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive, but hover around zero. So we have here a simple policy that for 75 years, has been doing what it's designed to do with little fanfare and minimal, if any, negative side effects. Abolishing it makes absolutely no sense at all. Thank you. John Donvan:Thank you. Jared Bernstein. Thank you, Jared Bernstein. And a reminder of what's going on. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, “Abolish the minimum wage.” You have heard two of the opening statements, and now onto the third. Debating in support of the motion, to abolish the minimum wage, the vice president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute, editor of the Cato Journal, and professor of economics at Towson University. Ladies and gentlemen, James Dorn.",1.0
for,"Good evening. It's a pleasure to be here. I hope you will keep an open mind and vote for abolishing the minimum wage. Jared gave some evidence -- there was just a new study out by David Neumark, written for the NBER, National Bureau of Economic Research, one of the foremost research organizations in the United States, with top scholars. He refutes much of what Jared just said. Actually, the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the fact that the minimum wage does destroy jobs. Why? Because if anybody believes in the law of demand, it means when prices go up, there's less of it that people buy. And nobody's ever disproven the law of demand, not even Jared. Nobody in Congress has disproven the law of demand. So, I think we should keep that in mind. Hong Kong never had a minimum wage. I've been over -- I've been visiting China since 1988, every year, just about. Hong Kong started to develop in trade in 1938 and it was just a bunch of shanties and everything. Hong Kong rose up to be one of the most prosperous places in the world without a minimum wage. So the minimum wage is neither necessary nor sufficient for prosperity; what prosperity requires is opportunities. The minimum wage destroys opportunities. I had a friend of mine, his mother was working at a department store up in New Hampshire. After the kids grew up, she was making close to the minimum wage. The minimum wage went up, she lost her job. She enjoyed this job; it changed her whole life. And she was denied the opportunity to go back and offer her labor services at the pre-minimum wage; that is, the wage that she was agreeing to work at freely. The minimum wage interferes with individual freedom and economic freedom. And that's what's wrong with the minimum wage to a large extent. It reduces -- it reduces -- it doesn't increase workers' bargaining power because it makes it illegal for the worker to offer her labor services for less than the minimum even though she's willing to do so because that's a better opportunity for her. And it makes it illegal for the employer to hire that worker. Also, it should be obvious that if you increase the wage rate above the going market wage rate, if it's only a little bit above, it's not going to have much of an effect. But if it's quite a bit above, as happened in New York State in the early 2000s, then it led to a about 20 percent decrease in the unemployment rate in New York State for teenage workers aged about 16 to 24 without a high school diploma. They kind of cut off the bottom rung for the ladder. They couldn't get in the market. There was a surplus. There's lots of jobs when the wage rate is lower; when if goes higher, there's fewer jobs. But many workers want to get those jobs at the minimum wage. The government promises people a minimum wage, but the politicians can't keep that promise because there's two sides to the market. The employers will not hire as many workers when the wage rate goes up. And in the short run, there may not be much unemployment. But in the longer run, as Russ pointed out, the employers will substitute skilled workers for unskilled workers. They might use a computer and have one worker rather than ten, or they may substitute labor-saving devices. And there's lots of evidence to show this. Just an article in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend, woman was running -- she runs bakeries, cupcake bakeries. She hires -- she has about ten young workers working for her. She said because of the anticipated increase in the minimum wage and the indexation, that she's going to replace those ten workers with some tablets and a skilled worker to run the operation so that they can order using the tablets. Another person that owns some restaurants and so forth, he's going to go to use his new app called Squared, which basically makes it easier to clear checks and process credit cards. And he will displace about 30 out of his 75 workers, he said in that interview. So this is a reality. The woman that lost her job in New Hampshire, that's not just a statistic, that's a personal story. We can play games with statistics. And there's a preponderance of evidence, as I said, that the minimum wage has these detrimental effects. In fact, Neumark in his study, after looking at all these other studies, said his conclusion has not changed. And it's a very, very rigorous study. What else happens? Employers use temporary workers rather than full-time workers. They might make one worker do the job of four because after all, there's a surplus of labor now. There's unemployed workers that are looking for these jobs so they can just, you know, lay somebody off and make the other workers work that much harder. It also destroys jobs, jobs that used to be done in the United States. When I was a kid, they had elevator operators in Buffalo, New York. You won't see those anymore. You might see them in Argentina. They don't have baggers at the grocery stores. Those have become full-time jobs, in many cases, unionized. And it slows job growth. There was just a new study out by Texas A&M showing that the minimum wage has slowed job growth, which we should expect. How do you explain these huge unemployment rates among black male teenagers that are, you know, over 30 percent? In Spain, they have a very rigid minimum wage. And the unemployment rate there is 26 percent, the national rate. The unemployment rate among younger workers -- unskilled workers who are typically younger workers, is double that. How do you explain that? The minimum wage, also, by the way, does not reduce the poverty rate. Poverty rate has actually increased a little bit because of the minimum wage. Doug Adie and other people have looked at that; Neumark as well. And if you can't get a job -- because, remember, the law -- what does it do? It increases the wage rate, but if you don't get a job, your income is zero. That's what a lot of people don't understand. The difference between the wage rate, which is the price, and income, which is the price of labor times the hours worked. If you can't get a job, your income's zero. So we found that the people that this affects are low skilled workers in low income families, and that's why the poverty rate is affected. Okay, so --",1.0
against,"Thank you, John. I want to return to the moral question that we started with because the moral question is all on our side. Let's talk about what would happen to real people in real families if the U.S. were to go down this untested and quite radical path of eliminating the minimum wage as our opponents urge. What I want you to understand is that roughly one quarter of all children in the United States, more than 17 million children, have a parent earning the minimum wage or just above. Another way to think about this, only -- almost one of three of those who benefit from the minimum wage, so they're just at the minimum wage or they're just above it, and so they're what we think that their wages are bumped up because of the minimum wage, are parents. One in three. That means that today, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage because of the low level of our minimum wage is still living below the poverty line at today's level of the minimum wage. These families, as Jared and I have actually studied, work more and more hours and yet still have to make terrible choices every day. They have to choose, ""Do I pay for childcare or leave my little child alone? Can I afford healthcare? Can I afford to put anything aside in case I lose a job?"" What our opponents are asking is to get rid of the minimum wage that keeps those families barely afloat today. How can they even consider that? I want to think beyond that family and what the implications of pulling out the rug under them would mean for the rest of us. First of all, let's think about the knowledge economy. Our opponents have been talking about teens and letting them work for less money, but we're talking about a knowledge economy where we want to compete for high-wage jobs, and the people who are going to take those -- the children growing up in those families are the ones who are going to be the human capital of our society going forward. They're going to pay your and my Social Security. They're growing up in those families, earning those very low wages. They'd be worse off. There would be less to invest in those children. Social mobility in the U.S. -- the U.S. used to be the home where, if you were brought -- born into a poor family, you could make good. That's less and less true. The American dream is under more and more threat. We're behind every country -- this is OECD data. We're behind every country except the U.K. now in terms of social mobility. We're behind France in social mobility. So do we really want to go backwards, get further away from the American dream? No, I don't think so. I think we want to restore the American dream, not turn this country into a Dickensian nightmare. Inequality, closely related to social mobility -- inequality is approaching record levels. And we think that half of the increase in inequality is a result of the falling minimum wage, half of the increase in inequality for those at the lower end. Then there's the issue of our economic recovery -- our fragile economic recovery. If the minimum wage -- if abolishing the minimum wage had any effect at all, it would surely take money out of the economy. In fact, it would act as a reverse stimulus. So let's think very carefully before we go down this road as a society. I'd like to bring up women, as the only woman on this panel. Over half of those who earn the minimum wage are women, and these women obviously already face disadvantages. If you look at the data, women are poorer than men at every age, and in old age the gap is tremendous because of the low wages that they earn. If we eliminate the minimum wage, this will especially hurt women. Now, can we afford the minimum wage? It's a big question. Yes, absolutely we can afford the minimum wage. As Jared said, we've had it for over 75 years, hasn't hurt overall economic growth. The wealthiest Americans are doing extremely well. Corporate profitability is growing; as we know, the stock market just broke new records. But the families at the bottom end are not sharing in this increasing economic growth. We can afford to let them share a little bit of that. There's no evidence that the minimum wage costs jobs. There was a famous study two decades ago by Alan Krueger, now the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Berkeley's David Card. They studied New Jersey's fast food restaurants and they found a slight increase in employment as a result of the minimum wage being raised. And countless economists have poured in to try to refute this and they haven't been able to. They've done all kinds of studies. And as Jared said, there's just no evidence that employment is hurt. And this applies to studies not just carried out in the U.S., but those in the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries. We heard about Hong Kong. Let's talk about Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a city-state of 7 million people, smaller than New York City, where I grew up. I don't think we want to gamble the United States' economic future on an experiment in Hong Kong. In China, however -- Thanks. In China, however, the provinces actually have something like a minimum wage. It's a monthly floor. But in Beijing, they actually have a minimum wage, and guess what? The central government in China just decided to raise that wage across the country so that it will be 40 percent of the average salary, which is higher than we have -- what we're talking about that we have right now. I just -- I just want you to thinkabout the maid who makes your bed in the hotel when you're out of town, the person who serves you that salad when you go to the fast food restaurant at lunchtime. Most of these people do not earn enough today to feed themselves, house their kids, and take care of their families. We -- they cannot afford to see their incomes fall. The moral argument is absolutely on our side, to not pull the rug out of low-income families. Please vote no on abolishing the minimum wage. Thank you.",1.0
for,"Well, we can't answer that precisely. Well, I don't know. I think some employers would take advantage of the change in the law to lower wages. And they would have lower income. The question is, what's the right way to help people who have low skills or who are struggling for all kinds of reasons, many of which are not their fault? We have a horrible school system. We ought to fix our school system instead of trying to help people through this artificial method. If the artificial method worked, I'd be -- it'd be great. It'd be great. When Karen says we can afford it, we can afford it, this group, because we all make more than the minimum wage. And I would guess that most of the people in this room -- because 95 percent of the American workforce does earn more than the minimum wage, it would have very little effect on us. It's the people that we don't see, people who have the toughest time finding work, who are punished by this good intention -- well-intentioned law. That's correct.",2.0

You cannot, in my mind, in good faith, in this economy, in any economy, talk about abolishing the minimum wage and not know what its impact is going to be. That's way, way too reckless. Now, the idea that workers are hurt by this the way Russ and Jim have argued is belied by research that looks very carefully at changes in minimum wages across different economies and different groups. Now, I don't want to get -- I don't know if we want to go there now, but we need some time to explain, I think, to the audience, what the research actually shows. You can't just say, ""Black unemployment is high, and we have minimum wages, therefore high minimum wages cause high black unemployment,"" because we've had periods when we've raised the minimum wage in the 1990s, we've raised the minimum wage in 1996, black unemployment came way down. So I'm not saying that it came way down because we had a higher minimum wage. I'm saying there are a lot of moving parts. And the best research compares the impact of the minimum wage controlling for those moving parts. And that's what we've been citing.",2.0
for,"May I respond to my friend? Yeah, two points. If there's an excess supply of labor, low-skilled labor, and they can't get jobs, yeah, the minimum wage will come down. But the competition will be among the workers. The workers that have lower valued alternatives, they can't get a job at the minimum wage, they will not have an opportunity to get a job. I think that's a very important point. Their wages will not stay low forever. Most of these workers are young. They will be in, they will get good work habits, they will learn things. The employers will eventually pay them more as their productivity goes up. You don't want to put the cart before the horse. When you go to get a job, okay, the government can increase the minimum wage, give you a raise. But if your skills haven't changed and anything else, that's not going to -- that's not going to happen.",2.0
against,"Thank you, John, because I made the moral argument, but I think it's really important to get the economic argument right. And I think the economic argument sounds like it's on their side, but it's absolutely not. It's -- I like them both very much as well. But I think good economics says that you have to make sure that you're not -- that you're actually looking at causality and that you're taking account of all of the variables. And what the economic studies really show is that there are a lot of other things that affect unemployment and that produce unemployment or employment. And thosehave to do with the overall state of the economy, has to do with education. And it's just overly simplistic -- -- analysis to say that -- that the minimum wage actually produces unemployment even -- I think what we need to focus on, though, for those people -- and they've said it again and again, and I absolutely agree, and we can all go out agreeing on this, is, we need to improve our education system. We need to get access to vocational education. We need to get access to higher education. That's what you need in a knowledge economy. And so I think we all agree on what we need to do for those people.",2.0
for,"I want to just say something general about the empirical literature on the minimum wage. There have been hundreds of studies done on both sides, actually hundreds have found that the minimum wage reduces employment. That was the consensus among economists until the Card and Krueger study in the 1990s. And that consensus has shifted somewhat. Now there are many economists who think that the effects are either small or minimal. Again, I would emphasize that small to me does not mean it's irrelevant. Small is still people's lives. But the point is that both -- Seriously, I've been on many panels with Jared. We have a good time. Those studies haven't convinced -- those studies that show that there have been serious losses of jobs, which Jim mentioned one of them, the Sabia, Burkhauser, Hanson study of New York workers, 20 percent drop in workers without a high school diploma. That's an incredible tragedy. They don't find that persuasive. The study wasn't done well. Strangely enough, we don't find the studies that find the other side persuasive as well. There's a big ideological gap between these two sides that we should be honest about, because if the studies were great, they would win. They would convince people. But the reason they don't convince people is that the world is a complicated place, as both Karen and Jared have said. There's a lot of things going on at once, and it's really hard to hold things constant. It gets a lot harder when the minimum wage affects a relatively small part of the population. So when 95 percent of Jared -- if I want to accept some of your salaried workers, some slightly smaller percentage of the workers earn more than minimum wage already, yeah, it's going to be hard to tease out the independent effect of that relative to all the other things that change in the economy at the same time. So it's very hard to do. It's not persuasive to the opponents.",2.0

You've got the Krueger and Card and a lot of other studies that showzero or slightly positive. David Neumark and others show slightly -- now, I recently corresponded with Neumark about this because we did a study at the Center on Budget -- we're doing a study. And we said, “David, what should we plug in to accurately represent the job loss effects that you, and our opposition, believe occurred?” Because we want to be fair, just like = thought Russ was pretty fair.

Now, if that occurs, that means that 99 percent of affected workers get a pay raise. Now, our opponents have consistently said, if 1 percent loses a job or loses hours of work, yet somehow 99 percent get a raise, it's a bad deal. That's just, I think, economically a very -- a very misleading .",2.0

against,"Sure. That's a great question. Like any other theoretical notion -- and it is a theoretical notion; a very cogent one, as you mentioned. It has to be empirically tested. You can't in economics -- this is not science, this is social science. It's different. You have to testit. And the tests that have been applied have been, I think, very careful pseudo-experimental kinds of tests, especially more recently, where as much as you can is held constant. And what those tests find is that you don't get the results that Jim and Russ have predicted. So you have to ask yourself what else is going on. And the other things that are going on are what I call the ""three Ps."" There are three other ways that an increase in the minimum wage gets absorbed that have nothing to do with job losses: prices, productivity, and profits. Okay? Profits -- and as Karen mentioned, corporate profitability is soaring at an all time high while compensation, by the way, as a share of national income is at a 50-year low. Profits are redistributed somewhat when minimum wages go up to low wage workers. I think that's a good thing, given the trends that Karen described. A very interesting and very positive impact is that you find that in the low wage labor market, a part of the economy that's fraught with turnover and vacancies, that goes down significantly. So productivity helps absorb some of the increase as well. And there's some price effects, too.",2.0
for,"Yeah. Well, Jared and I agree on something very important, which is economics is not a science. That's good. It's a start. It's more like history with a lot of numbers. It's nothing like physics or the sciences. So to me, the word ""social"" in front of it, it's a very important qualifier. And I think the challenge is the empirical evidence that Jared's talking about, I view as very unpersuasive. And it's -- I know it's unpersuasive because it doesn't persuade the opponents. No one reads these studies that are full of equations, and Greek letters, and lots of fancy statistical work, and go, ""Oh, my gosh --"" John Donvan:But can they be persuaded? ""-- I've been wrong all my life."" I don't know. It doesn't happen. In theory it could, but I -- everybody always says, ""Oh, they left this out. They didn't do this right."" They always have a reason, and that's because of the fundamental complexity of human society. So I want to ask instead of that -- those kinds of studies which = don’t think persuade even economists, and they shouldn't persuade you, = want to ask you to do the following experiment. If you decided to quit your job, you didn't like your job, you were bored, you wanted to try something else, and now you're going to go out in the workplace and find a new job, but the government passes a law that for you to be -- when you go to your new job, your new employer has to pay you, say -- let's pick a small -- relatively small number, 20 percent more than your current job. That's the law. So you've switched jobs, you’ve got to get 20 percent more, do you think that would be good for you or bad for you? You realize -- and my question is to my opponents, do you think that would make it harder for you to find work? They're arguing that, ""Oh, empirically -- it's an empirical question. Empirically, it doesn't have any effect when you artificially raise people's wages."" So you, you have no extra skills, nothing new, you come into the workforce, ""Yay, the government's passed a law. You have to be paid 20 percent more than in your last job."" Would you be happy? Would you be excited about that? I think you'd be scared. I would be. I think it's very difficult.",2.0
against,"But before I respond to that, I just want to lay out another thought experiment, which is that if you are really serious, if you really thought that teenagers couldn't work at the minimum wage, and that it was keeping them out of the workforce, then what you might look at -- and some countries that have very, very high minimum wages have looked at this -- is a separate minimum wage for teens. We have a separate minimumwage for tip workers. I'm not saying those are something that I would -- that's something that I would endorse, but if you're really serious about a separate population needing to get entry, that's what you would do. I mean, we're very lucky. We have an easier case to make, because the proposition on the floor is abolishing the minimum wage. You do not have to go to abolishing the minimum wage to address the arguments that our opponents have brought up even if you take them at face value.",2.0
for,"Yeah, I'll come back to this -- -- moral argument. If you think that people -- Now, I want to come back to this moral argument, because I think it's an important point. The question is whether individuals should be free to choose on their own terms, as long as there's not fraud involved and violence, to make themselves better off as theysee it or whether the government should mandate a wage rate which may put you out of a job. If the government says the employer has to pay you $9 an hour and you're only producing $5 a hour, you're going to lose your job. Now, why is the worker getting $5 an hour? Because he or she doesn't have very many good alternatives. They don't have much education. So the real way you want to increase their income -- you increase the wage rate, they lose their job, their income is zero. How do you increase their real income over time? They have to have a better education. They have to have work habits. They don't get any work experience if they can't find a job. And people do lose their jobs. There's lots of evidence on this. Douglas Adie did a very good study showing that when the real minimum wage rate, that is, adjusted for inflation, increased by 10 percent, he found that there was a almost four percent increase in the unemployment rate for low-skilled workers, in the long run, after firms made adjustments.

I didn't say it wasn't causing any problems. I said the problems are relatively small and they're hard to measure.

And as a result, it's pushed up tuition, and it's allowed colleges to raise their prices, their tuition a great deal. And as a result, many students have borrowed have a lot of money. And as a result, they're in big trouble. And especially in a downtime of economic growth when economic growth is so mediocre.",2.0

And so what we need to do to be competitive, to have productivity, to have the American dream again, to have people earning high wages and being able tosupport their families is investing in people's education. And so we have a big problem in this country in terms of K-12, and we have a big problem in terms of -- That's what we should adjust and not the minimum wage. Oh, no. So what I was saying is that I think the moral argument is on our side because those families need the minimum wage to support their kids. What they were saying is that somehow the minimum wage hurts those families and keeps them out of the workplace. I think the way you deal with people who are out of the workplace is you get education and training. They're saying they care about the same people, but they're saying that the minimum wage hurts them. I'm saying the minimum wage helps them.",2.0
for,"The living wage isn't by the taxpayer. I think it's usually a proposal to just have a higher minimum wage that would be able to support a family more easily. What kind of business do you have? I'll repeat it for those -- since you have the mic. You have a consulting business. And your workers are paid -- you said you have some that are paid $8.25 an hour? So none of your workers earn the minimum wage. No. There are some who do, though, and that's very hard on them, and that's no doubt about it. Right now there's a proposal with the city council of Washington to increase the minimum wage for special stores that have large footprints. This would be stores like Costco and Home Depot and super Wal-Mart. There are very few of those in Washington, D.C. But they want to raise it to 11-something an hour. The Washington Post came out the other day and said it's a horrible idea because Costco will leave. They won't be able to make a living, unfortunately. They have a lot of profit, but at $11.25, it's not clear they'll be able to keep that store in Washington. And The Washington Post thinks that's a bad idea. I do too.

You can't make the assumptions that our opposition does about what happens with living wages or minimum wages. And this has been studied, again, fairly carefully, not as much as minimum wages, but living wages have not been found to have the distortionary effects that Russ suggested. I do think the questioner gets into a very important point that we haven't touched on yet. If you abolish the minimum wage, and it falls a lot -- because by the way, if it doesn't fall a lot, then it can't possibly have the problems that they're suggesting. That was the point Karen made. But if you abolish the minimum wage, and it falls a lot, you will collect fewer payroll taxes. You will have to pay more in food stamps. You will have to pay more in unemployment insurance. You have to pay more in welfare benefits. And it is very much a transfer of the burden of poverty to the taxpayer in ways that minimum wages and living wages help to mitigate.",2.0
for,"Well, I would take just the opposite position. The American dream for most of our grandparents and maybe some of our parents and so forth, was to come to the United States from countries that had repression and so forth. There were no minimum wages. They could get a job. They learned how to speak English. They got on-the-job training, and their families were made better off over time. Immigrants coming over here now, if they're low skilled, they're not going to have that opportunity. And teenage workers without a high school degree that might be going to work and getting a job, these people aren't going to get jobs. The Card-Krueger study did not -- did not look at people that actually lost their jobs from smaller establishments. It was -- they did a survive on franchise restaurants. And they didn't take into account the people that actually lost their jobs. Now, these marginal firms don't make a lot of profits. They're making a normal return on investment over the longer period of time. And if they have to pay a higher wage rate, they're going to either fire some workers, or they're going to have less to reinvest in the firm to expand it. Other workers who -- sure, some workers gain, they keep their job, but other workers will lose their job and either go in the shadow economy or eventually end up on welfare maybe. So I want more opportunities for workers. And the government, just by saying you're going to pay a higher wage, as if there's no effects, is nonsense. It's like the law of gravity. The law of gravity operates even though leaves may blow up in the wind. Thelaw of demand operates. And when prices go up, people buy less, especially in the long run when they make substitutions. It's just common sense. I'm comfortable. I don't see any fruit. I hear the applause, but I don't see any fruit, so I'm feeling pretty good. I think most establishments already pay more than the minimum wage. And if the -- if the wage rate dropped for some workers, the lowest of the lower skilled workers, yeah, their wage rate may go down in the short run, but they'll have a job. And their wage rate's not going to stay at a low level forever if they work hard. That's the point. You're pricing these -- the politicians are pricing these people out of the market in the name of doing good. It's a feel-good policy, and the empirical evidence -- the preponderance of empirical evidence supports the idea that raising the wage rate arbitrarily will reduce jobs more so in the long run. There's just a ton of evidence. So it's not just based on the evidence, it's based on common sense, and just looking -- observing reality. You --",2.0
against,"I'm sorry. You've got to look at the evidence, and we -- the planners of today's event, I think wisely, decided we shouldn't use PowerPoint. That's a -- that's too bad in an evidentiary , but I support -- And it's the radio, too, you know? Graphs don't work as well on the radio. But what I have here in front of me is a graph that I'll show to anybody afterwards and -- that just frankly contradicts this notion that particularly Jim but Jim and Russ have hit on all night, common sense, common sense -- no. It's not common sense because there are lots of different ways. And I articulated them. You mistakenly said, ""These guys think nothing happens when you raise the minimum wage."" I gave you three good Ps as to the different things that happen. So the dynamics of the economy are such that the questioner is exactly right. You would not find a great deal of increased employment because the minimum wage is notcurrently a disemploying mechanism within the economy, but what you would find is a ton more poverty. And you have to consider this in the context of the EITC, Mr. Questioner over there, because if you take a minimum wage that's $7 an hour and you apply a 40 percent EITC to it, you're adding $2.80. Oh, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage subsidy for low wage workers, if you apply the current wage subsidy to a $7 minimum wage hour, it's 40 percent at the max, that's $2.80. Apply that to a $3 wage, which may be where it's going to fall -- Russ doesn't know, but it could be. Now you're talking about one-twenty -- $1.20 subsidy to that wage. So it's a $2.80 subsidy at the current minimum wage level. If that falls by half then the subsidy falls by half. One quick thing. We think that the minimum wage also affects those who earn just above the minimum wage, that it props up wages just above. So if you look at the people who earn at the minimum wage or just above, as I said at the beginning, we have one quarter of all children in the U.S., more than 17 million kids, who have a parent who earns at the minimum wage or just above who we think would be affected.",2.0
for,"Well, I agree. It does -- John Donvan:Russell Roberts. --prop up the minimum wage for -- and it has a bigger effect on the people who just earned it. And that's part of the reason why Wal-Mart, which pays more than the minimum wage, favors the minimum wage, because it makes their competitors more expensive. It raises the cost to other firms that are smaller and won't -- can't afford to pay as much as Wal-Mart does. So, I agree with the questioner, though. The level is relatively small, which means it's hard to measure. And the harm is relatively small. But as I started off by saying, for the people who can't find work, it's not small. For the people who aren't worth it, it's very tragic. Well, with the minimum wage, there are only so many jobs to go around. It's the old lump of labor fallacy since the wage rate is not allowed to go down if there's a surplus. So you're stuck. And the employers have a lot more power to dictate certain things to workers. They would have more flexibility and more freedom for both the employers and the workers if you got rid of the minimum wage. And I think if you got rid of it, the wage rate wouldn't change that much, because we're pretty close to the -- where the market wage rate would be. That's why politicians don't have large increases in the minimum wage. They can get the political brownie points, a feel-good policy, where most people think that the minimum wage is a good thing. That's why they don't increase it by a lot. When they have increased it by a lot, for example, in New York State, the study that was done -- I pointed to earlier -- it led to fairly significant decrease in employment. It is -- also the empirical evidence, it's just not common sense. There's a lot of empirical evidence on our side of the argument. So, I think Jared is unfair to mention that -- he doesn't mention anything about this most recent NBER study, which is much more sophisticated than the John Smith study that they like to cite.",2.0

I just don't get it -- I'm not trying to be cute here. I really don't get the logic that says -- it certainly relates to the last question. It's really a small deal. It doesn't really affect many people. But dammit it should be abolished, because it's a big problem and it causes all this unemployment. And you’ve heard them all night, talk about the damaging unemployment effects of the minimum wage. Yet somehow, it's -- at the same time, this de minimis policy. Those both can't be right. They're logically inconsistent. And I think the reason -- getting to the question, and it was a good question, to me, it's Congress's way of saying, “We're not going to let the market drive wages down on our lowest-wage workers to privation-level wages. We don't want to be Hong Kong. We don't want to be Mexico. We don't want to slide down the” -- In economics terms, we don't want to slide down the demand curve the way our opponents would like us to.

But I think the argument is that when we say it's relatively small, we're not saying it's unimportant, we're saying it's difficult to measure. It's difficult to tease out the independent effects when many things are happening at the same time. So as a result, when some states are doing well, they raise the minimum wage, and therefore it's hard to figure out what the independent effect is of what's going on underneath. But my question for you is, since you reject the logic that we made, and you say it's only an empirical question, I'd like to know why you think employers over the last 30 years have relentlessly punished not deliberately, but through their actions, have relentlessly punished low-skilled workers because they are relatively unattractive compared to workers outside the United States and automation.

The national unemployment rate fell below 4 percent. That was the time of welfare reform. And hundreds of thousands of low-wage, poorly-educated single moms came off welfare, got into the labor market. And with the complimentary boost of the minimum wage and a higher EITC, poverty rates fell very steeply. So, you know, I think you're fundamentally wrong. I'll tell you why employers fight against the minimum wage, because it cuts into their profits.",2.0

The almost 90 percent of Americans earning less than $24,000 a year who support raising the minimum wage, okay? I don't hear an argument from the other side as to why they're wrong and to why they would support, in the interests of their freedom, abolishing a minimum wage that 90 percent of them support. 80 percent of Americans between 18 and 30 support raising the minimum wage. Ten to one among unemployed workers support raising the minimum wage, ten to one. Now, earlier Russ said something about nobody's mind being changed. That's actually not true. It's true that a lot of people's minds don't get changed. But in fact, this research that we've been talking about, particularly these experimental designs where you can really make pretty fine granular comparisons have changed some minds. The Economist magazine now supports increasing the minimum wage. They didn't used to. Bloomberg News, Cranes New -- Cranes New York business is very much a business, a journal; the Costco CEO, the Starbucks CEO, even Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney, during the Republican said we should index the minimum wage to inflation, not abolish it, index to -- which by the way makes sense from -- I think he was speaking like a business guy. What you don't want to see is these surprise increases along the way. You'd like to see it indexed. And that, by the way, is part of the president's proposal.

He begged Congress to stop increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa, a process that had begun in 2007 and was scheduled to increase until it reached the U.S. minimum of $7.25. In 2009, employment on American Samoa fell 19 percent. That's because employment in the tuna canning industry, which was a third of their jobs, had fallen 55 percent. The governor of American Samoa who came to testify blamed that collapse on the minimum wage. And here's a quote from him, his testimony, ""We are watching our economy burn down. We know what to do to stop it. We need to bring the aggressive wage cost decreed by the federal government under control. Our job market is being torched, our businesses are being depressed.

A third of those who would be hurt are parents. One-tenth are single parents. More women than men would be hurt; 55 percent of those who benefit from the minimum wage are female. The average minimum wage worker contributes fully half of her or his household's entire income. Minimum wage laws do not seem to affect employment very much. Studies suggest that other factors, such as the overall state of the economy, how local industries are doing, matter a lot more for employment than the level of the minimum wage does. Several states have minimum wages above the federal minimum. There are no signs that the higher rates lead to higher unemployment. Abolishing the minimum wage would hurt inequality, it would make it worse. And it would hurt social mobility. It would make it harder for children of low-income families to get ahead. This is very personal for me. My grandmother was a single parent. She raised four kids. Fortunately, she had the minimum wage. At that point, it had become the law of the land.
