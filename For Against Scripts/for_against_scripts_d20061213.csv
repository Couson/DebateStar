for,"Good evening. I’d like to, uh, thank Mr. Weinraub and Bob Rosenkranz, uh, Dana and all the IQ staff, IQ2 staff, um, for organizing this event and keeping alive the tradition of civil discourse and debate in New York. Um, it’s, it’s a tradition that is, uh, unfortunately, uh, fallen out of favor in recent years. Um, now, contemplating the motion before us, that Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad, I have to admit that when I first contemplated this I thought of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbs. Maybe some of you know this strip. I’m thinking in particular of that, that, uh, cartoon whose first frame shows the little Calvin – he’s six years old, quite a demon – hammering, furiously, nails into a board. And then in the second frame Calvin’s mother runs into the room, screaming, Calvin, what are you doing to the coffee table? In the third frame, Calvin looks up with a look of extreme bemusement on his face, saying, Is that a trick question? Now, we all know that Hollywood in its current incarnation, uh, boasts a, a large quotient of anti-Americanism. Uh, the names Matt Damon, George Clooney, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, Michael Moore, Susan, Susan, Susan Sarandon – the, the list goes on and on. We also know that anti-Americanism is alive and well in the world today, alas. Now, what is the connection? I want to be clear about what the resolution before us – a resolution, by the way, that I, I hope you will support. It is that Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad. This is, this is where it gets tricky. This is not a referendum about the Bush Administration, the war in Iraq or any, uh, evils, real or supposed, of American society. It is a resolution about the effect of Hollywood movies and the Hollywood mindset on this phenomenon of anti-Americanism abroad. Now, the first thing to note is that anti-Americanism is what we might call a hearty perennial. It does not need Hollywood to thrive. It has a long pedigree, born of wealth and power. One thinks of Pericles and what he had to say about, uh, the way in which distinction bred envy, envy bred resentment and resentment, if not checked, bred hatred. Athens, in her day, was cordially hated. Rome, in her day, was cordially hated. So was the British Empire. As the authors of that great satire, 1066 and All That, reminded, remind us, after the first World War America emerged as what they called top nation. So it, it assumed the mantle of Great Britain’s, uh, pre-eminence and it also has passed the scepter, uh, as it were, of the world’s antipathy. And that has been something that’s been pretty constant from that time on. There have been intervening moments of gratitude, after 1918, for example, after 1945, for example. But basically then the world slips back into disliking us. Um, so that’s, that’s no, uh, just a kind of common reality which we, which we live with. That’s one form of anti-Americanism. In our, in the current form, anti-Americanism, I think, was born domestically of the Sixties. It’s a product in part of what the literary critic Lionel Trilling called the adversary culture of the intellectuals – um, fed by the Vietnam War, fed by the radicalism of the Sixties. We all can remember the students demonstrating in the street, spelling America with a K and so on. Um, something more radical happened abroad. But this is not new either. You go back to the Carter years. There are plenty of people chanting in the streets, down with the great Satan, death to America, burning American flags. Same thing in the Reagan administration, same thing in the Clinton administration. The same thing in both Bush administrations. Hoards shouting “Death to America” is always, seems always to be with us. So anti-Americanism, domestic and foreign, is like a, a kind of rank garden. It thrives. Hollywood merely supplies a layer of what you might call fructified, fructified manure. Anti-Americanism abroad would exist without Hollywood, just as cancer would exist without cigarette smoke. But Hollywood tends to make the malignancy worse. And it does this I think in two ways. One way is what we might call cultural anti-Americanism. By making so many trashy, vacuous movies, Hollywood uh, fosters a view of American life that is really at odds with the reality of American society. It um, shows this society to be largely sex-obsessed, violence-obsessed, a society shot through with cynicism about its founding institutions. And by and large portrays a decadent society in love with nihilism. That’s one way in which Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad, by portraying America as a society that has lost its soul. Another way and perhaps a more virulent way, a more political way, is the way Hollywood, by attacking those institutions of American life uh, shows America to be a bankrupt, corrupt, venal, savage uh, mercenary society. Um these, this side of Hollywood really sort of took off I think in the 1960s during the Vietnam War. Is there a Vietnam film uh, that shows America as anything other than a horrible, savage, misguided society? Maybe one or two. One thinks of the Hanoi Hilton but of course that was instantly savaged by critics. Stanley Kaufman, for example, dismissed it as filth. By and large I think any movie that deals with American society from the 1960s on deals with all of the institutions of American life as something not to be admired but to be disparaged. When was the last time you saw the president of the United States in a movie portrayed in a favorable light, or the military? It’s very rare that this happens. Oliver Stone, I think summed up what, what Hollywood is like now when he says “We have become the enemy.” Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad to such an extent that for example, German schoolteachers show Bowling for Columbine by Michael Moore as an accurate portrayal of American society. One thinks, for example, of the movie Syriana which blends incomprehensibility with anti-American animists to an extraordinary extent. Charles Krauthammer said that this movie could have been scripted by Osama Bin Laden and I believe that movies like this, that the general spirit of Hollywood today actively fuels anti-Americanism abroad. And I hope that you will support that motion. Thank you.",nan
against,"Thank you. You hear it all the time: Hollywood films are corrosive, destructive, decaying. You hear it all, all the time. You hear it from our noble opponents here and you hear it in right-wing talk radio shows. I guess that’s a redundancy if ever there was one. Um I just wonder if it, it worries our friends even just a little bit to find themselves in lock step agreement with Osama Bin Laden. The fact of the matter is there are a lot of bad movies out there. There are also a lot of bad paintings, a lot of bad sculpture. You know, most art sucks, excuse me. But here in New York, I stopped in at the Metropolitan Museum, my favorite museum in the world. And I didn’t see one work of art that wasn’t worthy. And you get the impression in museums that all art is fantastic, is beautiful, is wonderful. When in fact, for every one of those paintings at the museums, there are thousands, indeed tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands that just don’t deserve to be there. With film, because it’s contemporary, even more so in, in television, with television, we don’t have the time to do the culling and the selecting where the best kind of falls away, drops away. People like to look back at the forties and the thirties and say, why don’t they make great films like they did back then? The fact is they made a lot of lousy movies back then as well. I think in 2060 they’ll be saying, why don’t they make great films like they did back there at the beginning of the new millennium? We hear about sex and violence in films as if this was invented by Hollywood. The fact is, dramatic narrative has always been brutal, always been ugly, always been bloody and sexual. Oedipus Rex, he kills his father. You know what he does to his mother. He pokes his eyes out with jagged, rusty spikes. Medea murders her own children in a jealous rage against her philandering and faithless husband Jason. Uh, not just the Greeks but Shakespeare. I'm talking now about the greatest, most venerated, most honorable, the most loved dramatic expression of all time. Hamlet ends up with nine corpses on the stage. We counted them up in class. Some of them had been run through on swords, some of them had been poisoned. Macbeth kills his own king who is a guest in his house, and he does it out of pure ambition, out of pure greed. Richard III killed his own nephews who were boys, nine and eleven years old. Um, this was not invented by eleven Jews at Paramount Studios a couple of weeks ago last Thursday. This is the way dramatic uh, expression operates. It’s all about conflict, and uh, you know nobody wants to see the village of the happy nice people. Rational discourse, even handed discussion has its place, for example right here. But art is not it. Certainly dramatic art is, is not it. Now what you hear about Hollywood all the time is crass commercialism, all they care about is, is making money. Oh Hollywood just obsesses about the bottom line. Now, Hollywood care about the bottom line? Of course it does, but what business doesn’t? That’s not unique to the entertainment business. The dry cleaner at the corner has to make the bottom line. The insurance business has to meet the bottom line, manufacturing, uh, construction. If you don’t make the bottom line, you're out of business. Everything stands on the bottom line, that’s why it’s called the bottom line. And Hollywood’s interest in the bottom line is no different from any other business enterprise. And it’s interesting to me that people who consider themselves conservatives and very pro-business, not what I believe is America’s greatest business, which is information and entertainment, which is what I mean when we talk metaphorically about this thing uh, called Hollywood. So really there is, there’s absolutely nothing unique to that. I think what the problem is has a lot to do with the fact that we are so now inundated with images. We see so much media everywhere you go, even a man at a urinal, excuse me again, will see advertising. I’ve even seen digital screens. Um, a guy my age has plenty of time, let me tell you to look at all of that stuff. And we can’t tell any longer the difference between what’s real and what’s not. There’s no more East and West. You go to Beijing and you can be in, in uh, you know, at Banana Republic and J. Crew. There’s no more men and women, that is to say, women do what men used to do and vice versa. Uh, no more renters and landlords. I know there are but in another generation it was, it, it, it was like that. Now it really, for many of us, maybe most of us in this room, it is not. I think people can’t tell the difference any longer between images and the actual things that the images represent. I was approached by a boxing, the management for a boxer, a very famous prizefighter. It doesn’t matter who it is, his initials are Evander Holyfield. And they wanted him to move into an acting career and they were looking for material because I see a lot of new screenplays by a lot of new writers. And they wanted, they warned me though, they cautioned me that he considers himself a very religious man and a role model for young men and therefore he refuses to be seen in a movie that depicts him as causing damage, as causing harm to anybody. A prizefighter. I mean he’s made, he’s made his living, he’s achieved his fame, he has a management team that’s able to approach the professor because he has literally beat men into unconsciousness with his fist. And this is not a diatribe against the fight game. God forgive me, I love a great prizefight. In Los Angeles, it’s now impossible to, it’s illegal to own a lookalike replica handgun. You can’t tell if it’s real or not. It could be used in a crime. A real one that can actually blow your brains out is absolutely legal. I, I hold this up to you as an example of how people no longer can tell the difference between symbols of things and the things that these symbols represent. And likewise, lets look to anti-American sentiment abroad. What could be causing that? It couldn't be the ruinous policies of this recent administration. It’s got to be Hollywood movies. So much easier to, to believe that. I must tell you I’ve traveled all around the world, I'm privileged to travel all the world and, and to lecture on screen writing issues and talk to film development corporations. And we are very much loved all around the world. I had the privilege of teaching Masters classes last spring in Paris and London and imagine my good fortune that I could stand in front of you and actually truthfully pronounce that, that sentence to you. And in the lobby of the conservatoire in Paris, there are two dozen posters of movies all around the room. And this is in mean old America-loathing France. And twenty-one of the movies are Hollywood movies, are American films. Only three of them were French films. The truth is we are loved all around the world for our, our film. The films show that we’re an open society. Do we want to go back as Jim suggested in the piece that I read to the good ol’ days when everybody was white and women knew their place? I don't think so. Thank you very, very much. wanted to take ten seconds of my time for a nod to my esteemed colleague, Mr. Kimball for the ex-, due expression that I hope that we can all take with us, fructifying manure. And I will try and use it in every one of my speeches. Has Hollywood fueled anti-Americanism abroad? Where’s the evidence that we should be asking this question at all? Yes, there’s a lot of anti-Americanism, yes Hollywood exists. But where’s the connection? What’s the cause and effect? We have the peoples, we have people’s responses to why they’ve become anti-American in the past few years. None of them mention Hollywood. What’s the problem with the data? Now if you were to posit Hollywood as the problem, even though there is no data to support this thesis, what would be the tipping point? In other words, Hollywood has been around since the early twentieth century. Anti-Americanism has peaked in recent years. And in a way we last saw during the Vietnam War. Would anyone wish to argue that Hollywood has fundamentally changed in the past six years? What films would you point to, to support the contention? Well if you didn’t like Fahrenheit 911, what about Flight 92 and the spade of extremely patriotic movies that have recently come out? Men of Honor, Thirteen Days, Saving Private Ryan, Patriot. Well of course Hollywood releases lots of different kinds of films. But where has any reputable study anywhere found a direct tie between the kinds of films being produced at the given moment and a rising anti-American sentiment around the world? In fact, the opposite appears true. Hollywood is frequently what appeals to foreigners about America, even those who detest our foreign policy. It’s called show business. Hollywood Studios are owned by global multinational conglomerates whose goal is to maximize their shareholder value. They do this by trying to produce a product, a product that will appeal to the widest possible audience. To do this, they must do their respective best to appeal to the most broad marketplace, here and abroad. And unless you believe that Hollywood is run by a conspiracy, then all Hollywood is doing is reflecting the values of the people to whom it seeks to appeal. Now if you would argue, again, absent any data or evidence of any kind, that this somehow increases the incidence of anti-Americanism, then what you're really arguing is that American values and the values of the global marketplace are the cause of anti-Americanism. And if that’s the case, and I would contend that it’s not, then you're really objecting both to capitalism itself and to the way that Americans like to think of themselves as citizens and consumers. That sounds kind of anti-American to me, and moreover, it sounds like you're shooting the messenger. In America against the world, how we are different and why we are disliked, based on ninety-one thousand interviews conducted in fifty nations from 2002 to 2005 by the Pew Research Center, the authors write that “while the first hints that the world was becoming troubled by America came soon after the election of George W. Bush, and that whatever global goodwill the United States has in the wake of the September 11th attacks appears to have quickly dissipated after the Iraq invasion. Favorable opinions had more than slipped. They had plummeted.” And it’s grown worse since May when that was published. The most recent Pew finding showed that favorable opinions of the US had gone from eighty-three percent in 2000 to fifty-six percent in 2006 in Britain, seventy-eight to thirty-seven in Germany, sixty-two to thirty nine in France. When one looks at the results of these surveys, you see tremendous international opposition to the War in Iraq and America’s policies on global warming. If you speak with foreign leaders, you hear genuine concerns about specific aspects of US foreign policy, the refusal to agree with the Kyoto Treaty and global warming. The withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, the War in Iraq, difficulty getting visas to visit the United States. Perhaps I'm looking at the wrong polls or talking with the wrong foreigners. But I’ve yet to hear anyone mention Everybody Loves Raymond reruns as the fuel feeding the anti-American fire raging across so much of the globe. And that’s leading the whole world to, I was going to say that word but I guess I can’t say that word since this is on NPR but that’s a different uh, subject. Taking to that place down below in a hand basket.",nan
for,"Now that Pew Poll that uh, was cited by Robin, uh, I have to say has some statistical problems because in terms of France, Germany, and Britain, they over-sampled the Muslim population, sampling them at levels close to fifty percent. And that accounts a great, for a great deal of the change. When considering this motion, whether you're going to support it, the real question is whether the America that you see in the generic Hollywood that constitutes television shows and movies and music, is the same America that we all live in and work in. I mean what if your only glimpse of the United States was the latest report of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton and their boycott of underpants? Um in nations around the globe, there are lots of people who have never been to the United States. Now Richard Walter has traveled the world and he said he was privileged to do so, but there’s lots of people that have not. And they’ve never come here, they’ve never met you. And so their only impression is the export of the pop culture by the Hollywood community. And that includes all of this product. It includes television, and music, and movies. Uh, an appearance on The View by Danny DeVito. And once upon a time, as Richard Walter alluded to talking about the thirties and forties in Hollywood, there’s a nickname for this, it’s called a Golden Age. It’s for a reason because iconic images were sent around the world, images of Henry Fonda, images of Clark Gable, images of John Wayne. And the world fell in love with America, and they fell in love with those Hollywood images. And there was a, a set of values. There was optimism and there was courage. And there was unshakable belief in freedom, and unshakable belief in fairness. To, to show you how much it shifted um, in the period, is it, John Wayne who was made into the symbol of America by director John Ford, the cowboy was rugged and independent and gallant and true. We move forward to 1969 when the first film that was X-rated wins the best picture. Uses the name cowboy, it’s Midnight Cowboy. And here the cowboy’s profession is relegated to that of a male prostitute. The cowboys uh, follow in the long way. But things continued in what Roger Kimball called the cultural anti-Americanism. Since the 1960s, that what people see around the world is an America of extreme violence, of rampant crime, of unapologetic narcissism, of licentious exhibitionism, and self-loathing. And this is misshapen. It’s distorted. It’s a place where even Tony Soprano would run to his therapist. And look at rap lyrics. I mean rap lyrics…not all of it, but a lot of it, have themes of assaulting women, dealing drugs, killing the police. In many cases—well, actually, almost all cases—women are described either as female dogs, or garden utensils. And the—and the export of this pop culture has increased. Um, multiplexes were built in Europe, and, uh, the, the exports have gone up to a level of 40—to 50 percent of film box office, is on foreign shores. That includes the films that my colleagues brought up, uh, Syriana and Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 which has been very popular in the Afghan case. Um, America’s recent film exports, though, took the idea of artistic license in relation to violent scenes to a whole new level. We have a whole new genre of films that are doing big box office abroad, and they deal with nothing but…sadistic, senseless, sickening torture. I’m talking about films like Hostel, which did $33 million abroad, the Saw series, there’s three of them, they did $160 million abroad. These films, Hostel’s plot is a group of young people who are traveling, who are taken prisoner by an organization that allows businessmen to torture and kill for entertainment. There’s no plot. And they lead our neighbors abroad to believe, that America is deviant, and despicable and violent. It’s no wonder that, we have, uh, heard this nickname of Israel as “the little Satan” by some of the people we’re fighting against, and they call us “the great Satan.” As a matter of fact, uh, Robin referred to studies…this isn’t a poll but it certainly is an event when, right after 9/11 one month later, angry mobs went to the local cinemas, and burnt down five of them that contained American films. I guess they gave it a thumbs-down. The, uh…the, the other aspect of Hollywood that’s very disturbing, is the way representatives of free enterprise are depicted. Business people, executives, and corporations. Um, you know, I—I would expect that in a town that, that writes scripts that every once in a while we’d see, uh, a corporate executive as a villain. But it’s almost always that way. Oliver Stone made Wall Street, named his main character Gekko, and he extolled the virtues of greed. In Syriana, as, um…you know, uh, my colleagues have brought up, which, by the way, George Clooney used the Charlize Theron formula to win an Oscar. That’s you pack up the—pack on the pounds and then pick up an Oscar. And in, in that film, there’s a business executive with a suit that explains anti-Americanism. Explains the reason America is successful, he says, “Corruption is why we win.” Hollywood hasn’t even left their remakes alone. When they remade The Fugitive, all of a sudden they have to have a pharmaceutical corporate as a co-conspirator with the one-armed man that was not in the original television show. Uh, my colleague, uh, Josh brought up The Manchurian Candidate. Which inexplicably changed the villainous totalitarian government, into a corporation. The Manchurian Corporation, what do they manufacture? So apparently in Hollywood wealth is taken for granted, it’s a zero-sum game, a finite pie, where if one person wins, then another loses. Uh, last year, there was a remake of a famous American symbol. Superman. And Superman has always been associated with the phrase, “Truth, justice, and the American way.” And if you went to the film, you noticed, there was no American way, or it was taken out. And maybe that’s because, Hollywood has manufactured a new American way that does not fit with either truth, or justice.",nan
against,"Thank you. Somehow it seems that, um… our panelists, some of our panelists have the notion, that the only America people around the world see, is the one in movies and television. Do they truly believe, that these people all over the world are idiots and morons, who have no idea what is going on with this horrific war? Do they really believe that over and over again it’s a Hollywood movie, rather than the killings, the terrorism, the bombings…the friends, the relatives, the relatives that people know, who are being…subjected…and dying in this horrific situation? Do they really think that an hour in front of a TV set counters all of the news, and all of the TV reports, and all of the paper reports? Truly hard for me to imagine. Does Josh really think that the war that he advocated for has less of an effect on people than watching a movie? Or that if we follow his lead and go to war with Iran, that that will in any way…any way do anything but continue to destroy the country that we love? The country that Oliver Stone loves? The country that Michael Moore loves? The people in the community in Los Angeles who love, we may disagree with them, but the notion that we say they hate America, is one I personally find disgusting. Let me go back to 9/11 for a minute. We all remember…I was not in New York, many of you were here, the terrible time, the tragedy. And then this amazing, amazing outpouring, around the world. Embracing us. Supporting us. Offering help to us. The spectrum of countries who came forward and wanted to be with us at this time was truly something to behold. We know it from the information, we know it from the news sources, people I’m sure here have individual stories, when you would call somebody from another country and what they would say and how they would reach out to us. And then that changed, right? And then to use the Pew study which we can argue about endlessly but I think you’re totally wrong on the over-sampling issue. To use the Pew study again we saw, after the Iraq war, a big drop, right? Turkey went from 52% of the country supporting us to 12%. Britain, our ally, 83% to 56%. And Jordan from 20% to 1% had supported us, and now, over a period of years were no longer. Well, I’m absolutely sure that the reason for that was Ocean’s 11. That’s exactly the reason, or maybe it was Shrek, no, I think maybe it was Shrek, that caused that terrible fall-off to happen. That really would explain the statistical drop, right? I mean, it makes perfect sense. This was a war of choice…that our country went into. The world was opposed to us in the world—in this war of choice. Now people can argue we still should’ve done it. But we know the world was opposed to this war of choice. We invaded, we went in, we occupied a country in the Middle East with oil resources. And now, Pew study again, in 14 out of 16 countries, a majority think the world has been made less safe because of that war. I’m sure that those facts are due to Spider Man. There’s no question that that must have been the reason that people changed their thinking. Or maybe it was in Men in Black, I think that probably would’ve made the case more effectively. The war goes on, it continues, the polling numbers around the world continue to get worse and worse for the country we love, for the country we care about. America is not trusted around the world. And as a patriot, that’s a terrible, terrible thing. And that’s not because of any fantasy TV program. That’s not because of a trashy, crappy, awful movie that Hollywood’s made and…I’ve occasionally made some of those movies. That’s not the reason and we know that and I think any rational, sensible, thinking person knows where that comes from. It comes from reality. Hollywood is fantasy, gentlemen. Hollywood makes up stuff. But there’s a reality out there that trumps any kind of bad screenwriter, or salacious material, there’s a reality that’s facing people all over the world, day in and day out. And we have to look at that reality. We have to embrace and deal with the truth of what’s in front of us. This is a diversion. This is, uh, it’s not—it’s beyond shooting the messenger. This is trying to find some simple little answer, rather than looking at, truly, a terrible, terrible situation, which is going to take us amazing years and time and effort, to overcome. Which is this rising and increasing tide of anti-Americanism. And the United States says we’re not in favor of the World Court. And it refuses to sign the global warming agreement. And we hear about Abu Ghraib. And in Britain, 41% of the country says the US is a greater threat than Iran. This is not because of Barbra Streisand. This is not because of Sean Penn. This is not because of the Happy Feet movie. I think that, we must remind ourselves over and over again, what Hollywood does, is fiction. Let’s make sure that we understand that, let’s put fiction its proper place, yes, it can have some influence on people, yes, you can get annoyed at seeing somebody who’s not acting properly. Yes, you can get turned off if there’s free sex or materialism. But is that the reason, compared to this extraordinary situation, again, a war of choice, and a war where we’ve not been able to convince the world for any of the reasons— We’ve not been able to con—remember, we went to this war, the world’s opposed to us, all kinds of reasons, and we’ve not been able to convince the world of any of those reasons. Whatever the reasons of the moment are, from the weapons of mass destruction or Al Qaeda’s connection to Saddam or democracy. And we think Hollywood is in any way causing the rise of un-Americanism? It, in many ways, defies logic, and defies reason. So…I urge all of you to vote your rational selves, not to vote a Hollywood fantasy scriptwriter who might make up a notion, that yes, some silly movie was going to affect people all over the world, rather than what’s going on today. Go ahead. Well, I’ll speak to that, I think, uh, no, I don’t believe that that fuels anti-Americanism. Movies like Michael Moore’s movie, and I think Michael Moore is an overfed, underloved narcissist, I’m not a fan. Uh, but when people abroad look at a movie like that, what they see about America is that America’s a place where people can be critical of the—of their own nation. sponsored a—I try to cut down on some of my activities but I could—as a Jew and as an American I could not turn down the Fulbright Commission when they asked me to, uh, sponsor an Egyptian scholar, I had to reach out to my Arab Muslim brother, particularly at this time, don’t you think. And what he loved about America was its ability to, uh, be critical of the administration, he said if people spoke that way of Mubarek they would be… disappeared, or off the street. American films, uh…they extol, essentially, the American dream, and what is the American dream, the American dream is a certain materialism to be sure, nothing wrong with that. People who can’t get the basic material, food, clothing, shelter for themselves, for their children, they will listen to any tyrant, any dictator. We’ve seen dreadful, dreadful history, uh, throughout history and especially the last 100 years, testifying to the truth of that proposition. So a certain materialism’s okay and people across the world, they, they just love what they see, they love the material stuff that they see in, in Hollywood films, but more to the point… Hollywood films extol the notion of the American dream, and what is the American dream. It’s the notion that if you’re willing to work hard, if you’re willing to get educated, in this country you can do anything. You can move up from your lowly station and achieve anything if you’re just willing to again get educated and, and, uh, and work real hard. Now people will tell you on both sides that that’s a hoax, that’s kind of like the lottery designed to, uh, let people, uh, imagine they can do things that they can’t, but I must tell you from my perch at UCLA and in Hollywood, I see people break through every day, you’ll hear that it’s about connections, who you know. That’s bunk, I know really well-connected people who cannot get arrested in Hollywood and I see absolute fresh faces break through every day. Like it, don’t like it, there’re so many myths, so many hoaxes about Hollywood, one of the biggest among them, is that it is not a meritocracy, it’s all about connections. The fact is that Hollywood is a remarkably democratic place, and truly a meritocracy, people succeed on the basis of their talent, on the basis of their ingenuity and their, their discipline, and it’s a great credit to this nation, I think it’s the greatest industry that we have. Joshua— Joshua, you scare me. I mean you’re, you are scaring me. And, and that’s fueling my anti-Americanism right now. But— So are you asking for a, uh, a completely whitewashed export, export? So we should all go back to the days of June Cleaver and, and promote the wear – maybe we should all be wearing pearls and vacuuming. Is that, is that what you want? It’s not clear. He’s asking for censorship. He’s saying, Censor things that I don’t agree with. Of course you are.",nan
for,Josh did not say that.,nan
against,"Well, make a documentary and pour your contempt on him. Well, I, I, I quite disagree. Uh, I don’t think it’s fair at all what you say, respectfully. Uh, we’re, we know there is a rise around the world, uh, in anti-American sentiment. Um, we’re arguing that’s it not, not, uh, Hollywood fueling that. Aren’t we allowed to say what we think, uh, just might have something to do with that? Can anybody doubt, if you read the papers, what it is that, uh, that, that fuels this – these wrongheaded and disastrous policies that represent the opposite of the American ideal and the American tradition? If, if it was, if it was a le – If it was a court case and Hollywood was being tried as, you know, the guilty one for the crime we’re saying, No, we know who the guilty one for the crime is. We know what that guilty is and it’s the war. There’s no, no question about it. I understand your point and we could parse the words. What does fuel mean? How much fuel? But I actually think it’s much more substantive to go to the real, the real question -- or the real question behind the question, from my point of view, maybe not yours – and say, Here is why anti-Americanism is being fueled a…abroad. We know the reason. MAN Yes, but that --",nan
for,"Yes, but that would assume that, that anti-Americanism is a new phenomenon. It’s not. We’ve had it – No.",nan
against,"No, not new. But the numbers are – Uh, there’s no – Do you doubt that the numbers are increasing?",nan
for,"Yes, I do. I do.",nan
against,Since – Wait a minute. You don’t think since the Iraqi War that it’s not increased?,nan
for,"Well, I, I, I can – …that it’s not increasing numbers because you questioned whether we could debate the statistics.",nan
against,"Yes, and I’ve got the…",nan
for,"The Pew poll, um, yeah, okay. Good. The Pew poll sampled – …sampled, uh, nine hundred and two people in Great Britain. Four hundred and twelve of them were Muslim. Nine hundred and five in France, four hundred were Muslim.",nan
against,That’s…,nan
for,"Nine hundred and two in Germany, four hundred and thirteen are Muslim. That does not reflect the percentages of the populations in those countries. That poll, that poll is statistically invalid. Well, wait, wait, wait. I, I want to get in on this, please.",nan
against,"The, the, yeah. Well, let me respond. First of all, you did see the sentence here. I know you did not intentionally leave it out – which is clearly marked, “Sample is weighed to be representative of the general population. “ So you’re not just quoting the first – Let me finish. So you’re not just quoting – So I understand -- Okay, but it says that. You got the percentages from here and it says, We know the percentages are too large and like good statisticians did, we adjusted for it. But let me go back to the substantive point, cause you’re just wrong on that one. The substantive point is, I think, goes back to what Bernie said. Yes, Michael Moore has three best selling books in Germany. But it doesn’t compare to The Titanic, Star Wars, E.T., Pirates…and Lord of the Rings. It’s not even close. And how do we make the case that those movies that are loved around the world, they’re embraced around the world, that people fight to get in and see around the world – how do we say that is fueling anti-Americanism? And, and your –",nan
for,We don’t. Nobody says that.,nan
against,"And, and your question is – and what we’re saying is – So you’re agreeing with us. Thank you. No, Hollywood is not a factor, is not a significant factor. Yes, there are many reasons. I mean, it could be the proliferation of trans fats across the world. There are many reasons. But Hollywood is not the most significant reason why anti-Americanism is growing around the world.",nan
for,"Okay, good question. I think it’s the degree of specialization that Hollywood has had in villainizing and demonizing the representatives of free enterprise. And why, and why do I even talk about free enterprise? Because America in the world represents the greatest experiment in free enterprise in the history of man. I mean, Western civilization generally – and America specifically – is an aberration in human history. And part of the whole class warfare concept, really, is to make success something that you should feel guilty for. And you see this theme running through. And it, and it’s, and it becomes more prevalent when Oliver Stone names a character after a lizard. It becomes more prevalent when we have this series of movies where the plot line involves the evil corporation and the crusading worker or journalist, or single mother with a push-up bra. It, it, it’s the same pattern but what it does is, it takes away from a great part of this country. Instead of something that could be told which is sort of the entrepreneurial cowboys in this country, going back to the luminaries like Thomas Edison to national treasures like Steve Jobs. Who creates prosperity around the world through innovation that is fostered by a system that didn’t happen by accident. I think that that, that is a significant and more subtle point of anti-Americanism though I, I say it’s not exclusive to the period after the decline of the studio system in the sixties. But then again, Frank Capra also made films, a series of films called Why We Fight that were made specifically during a time of war to bolster our side and demoralize their side. Instead today, as we brought up with Syriana and other films of that elk, films are being made to bolster their side – and to demoralize our side. And the, the short word is the 1960s. I mean why is it that today you can never hear the word corporation? This is now, it’s, it’s synonymous with evil. And if you prefix the word corporation with multinational, it becomes kind of the, the epitome of all evil. Why is that? I mean sure there were plenty of movies in the past that may have represented this or that businessman, this or that politician as corrupt or evil, but now it’s always the case. I mean some of my colleagues mentioned movies that, where they’ve changed the plot. I mean, and I’ll just mention one more, The Bourne Identity. In the book, the bad guy was Carlos the Jackal. In the movie, it’s the CIA and this is consistent. I mean it’s just every kind of thriller that you see these days uh, the United States government, the United States military, the United States commercial enterprise. It’s always presented as somehow corrupt, venal, savage.",nan
against,"Richard Walter. Now Hollywood takes on corporations because it’s David and Goliath. I have nothing against the corporations, I'm a free enterprise capitalist myself. And um, the reason they uh, these, these stories treat them the way they do is because it’s the little guy versus the, versus the big guy. Nothing new about it at all. You know American film is world film. Films made outside the United States, only one in ten will be shown outside the country of its origin, but all American films are shown outside the country of their origin. Some as you know are, are shown only outside the country of their origin. That is to say, they can’t win domestic distribution deals and instead are released on cable and direct to video. What can explain this? The answer is the quality of American film and I also I believe the diversity of American films, the immigrant heritage of the American uh, nation and of the American film business in particular. When you look at American films, you’re looking at the world because you're seeing people of every race, of every creed, of every persuasion. American films are the single biggest export in the nation. They contribute more affirmatively to the reduction of the unfavorable balance of trade. They are a blessing upon us and should be celebrated by people who really love this country, who really consider them to be patriotic, rather than constantly besmirching them and caviling about them.",nan
for,"Well I remember when I was in uh, high school. My Jesuit teachers would drum various things into us. And one saying they had was “Never deny, seldom affirm, always distinguish.” It pains me to observe that the speakers against this motion tonight seem to be unable to appreciate that the motion does not say that Hollywood causes anti-Americanism. It is not a referendum on the Bush administration or the war in Iraq. It simply says that Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad. It seems to me that um, my team has supplied numerous examples of how this, how this happens. And we could certainly spend the entire night providing examples. One of the people on the opposing side remarked on the remarkable outpouring sympathy for the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Well I, I would, and then its quick evaporation. Um I would say that that outpouring of sympathy was basically a version of sentimentality lodged upon the United States in its you know, unusual posture as victim. As soon as the United States began standing up for itself, that sympathy vanished. And I think that tells us a lot about the world opinion and how we can depend upon it. But in terms of Hollywood which is really a mindset, as James Hirsen said, it’s not just the movies. It’s really, we’re talking about a way of looking at the world, pop culture in general. I think this is a mindset that has given up on America in many ways, given up on those traditional virtues. James mentioned free enterprise but there are many other things. Individual liberty, belief in the, in the future, really. And – Done? I will finish then, or stop.",nan
against,"Um I guess the only thing I can say is that if American movies uh, bred anti-American sentiment, I'm not sure why Iran and North Korea don’t have compulsory Sunday matinees. , . Well it’s slightly off subject, but I want to know why Josh was one of only two Americans at this conference. Now I am scared for our country and the impression they get, and have somebody over there who advocated for the war and wants us to bomb Iran. But going back to the primary subject, lets not confuse bad movies or even critical movies. The assumption here is, if it’s a movie critical of something in the United States, therefore that will fuel anti-Americans. Not true, not accurate. To use Jo-, to use Josh’s words, common sense can tell us that many people all over the world and many people here have seen movies that are critical. That does not turn you into anti-American. And I would argue that the movies, the popular movies, the ones that are being seen in overwhelming numbers, as Bernie helpfully provided this list, far outweigh – and if we go back to the, the woman’s question about fueling, you know I don't want to get into technical what is fuel and what’s not fuel. But lets say for a moment, Titanic, Star Wars, E.T., that’s building tremendous goodwill which would and therefore there would be no fuel for the couple of incidents which might possibly, on a given day, encourage somebody to be against us. Thank you.",nan
for,"Um - Yeah I mentioned uh, you know I, I live close to Los Angeles and I love Hollywood, but I love America more. And uh, I’ll tell you, Richard Dreyfuss, who used to speak differently about America until he went on a campaign to teach civics and he read some himself, has called this country a miracle. And the innovations and advancements that we’ve had here were because of a system where for the very first time, rights and powers were viewed as implanted in individuals. And some of those were transferred, pursuant to a social contract we call the Constitution, to a government. That had never happened before. Um this motion is, is about free speech. And uh, to address an audience member who asked about responsibility today, the responsibility is greater for two reasons. One is because of what Thomas Freedman calls the flat earth. Because Hollywood exports more instantly, and two is because of the greater war. We were attacked in the city, it was the greatest attack on continental soil in our history. The greater war continues, even many of those who opposed the war in Iraq are still cognizant of the fact that there is a war on terror. The reason I, I had asked you to vote for the motion was simply to raise awareness that this output of pop culture coming out of Hollywood matters. And it’s not only for our domestic consumption, it’s being consumed by the world, it shapes the way they view us. And Hollywood ought to use its power to help America prosper. I mean in that way, in the world’s eyes, they’d be a winner.",nan
