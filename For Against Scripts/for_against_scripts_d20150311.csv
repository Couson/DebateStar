for,"Thank you very much. Thank you. So let me say, first of all, I'm not here on an official mission from the European Commission to turn America to this notion of law. It's more the academic pleasure and the opportunity to come to Manhattan and discuss with these g reat American thinkers. And I will just report to you how this works in Europe and where it comes from. So, first of all, the ""Right to Be Forgotten,"" the words , the natural words, they don't tell you the whole story , because actually it is about a deletion right . I t is about you exercising control over personal data, you asking big corporations or the state to delete this data which they have about you. Why this is important? It is important because it allows you to control your own life. In the language of the German constitutional court, already from the '70s, this was called informational self -determination, and the judges said in a democracy, in a free country, you as an individual must have the right to control what others know about y ou. You must be able to ask “ What do you have?” and you must be able to ask for deletion, of course within reason. You cannot ask a doctor to delete the medical records, because the doctor must keep them either to show what he has done or she has done i n terms of liability. Of course you can't ask the press to delete a bad review if you are a concert pianist, or for that matter if you are someone who has done malpractice or if you are a politician. There are limits to this, which are limits which are i mportant in a democratic society, because that's what you will hear from the other side, that this is an attack on democracy. We see that differently in Europe. We believe democracy needs both. It needs privacy. It needs the ability of the individual to decide himself or herself what the state in particular knows about them, because if you don't have the privacy , how can you organize disse nt? How can you organize a new political party, which maybe wants to , if already the government always knows everything about you. So, we need privacy in a free society as we need free speech, and therefore, and now I turn to the recent judgment. First of all, you have to understand this just doesn't fall from the sky like this, but it is application of existing law which we have in Europe since 1995. And it is basically a right to ask a big corporation to delete information about you. Google argued in the case,“T his doesn't apply to us. We are not what we call in Europe a data controller.” Our judges saw that differently. They said sure, you control data about individuals and you profile them . When you put in the name of an individual, Google gives you more than anything else, any other source of information about this person , and our law requires that in the same way that our people can ask data brokers, the bank, you know, they can ask in school after a certain time for things to be deleted, they should be able to ask Google for deletion. Now, t he person in question who brought this case from Spain, he had not paid some social contributions and therefore his house had been confiscated and it was a legal obligation in Spain to have a publication in a newspaper of this fact in order to make the auc tioning of the house to cover the social contributions better and attractive for the Spanish state, because if it's in the newspaper there will be more people bidding for this house. So , the court said you cannot ask the newspaper to take down t he information because they have a legal obligation to publish, but Google you can ask. And this is a principle which also applies when it comes to free speech and democracy. It may well be that Google has to put things -- take things down, but it doesn' t mean the information disappears. It will stay in the newspaper. It stays on the website of the newspaper of the BBC, of the television station, all this stays around, but Google is subject to the same law of self -control of information, of self-determi nation of individuals, which allows them to ask first what do you have about me and second, please delete. Does it work? Yes, it works well. I just last week met the chief privacy officer of Google. He told me that now they are dealing with these reque sts in real time. In the beginning there were around 200,000 requests and they had to employ a number of new staff to deal with this, but now it works well. There are practically no complaints which do go to the court. Google has understood t he European law of balance between privacy and free speech. The decisions, you know, in the beginning very contested. I think in the meantime everybody says this is working well. And finally, this is something which is important for the future, because more and more data about you will be collected in the digital age, in the internet age, in the age of ever stronger censors, wearables, internet of things and so on. So, when you think tonight about the motion, think about these new censors. Think about the Apple watch. Think about the department store in Manhattan which now follows you on your mobile phone wherever you stand. All this is collected and recorded and there areaddress dealers and information dealers which have files o n you with between 200 and 2,000 parameters, about every person. And these files, they are sold . For example, in a political campaign. Those who have more money, they can buy these files and target you as a voter. If you say, ""I as an individual want to have control over my data and what's happening to them and I want my children to have control, and I want to have, as a parent, control over what happens to data of my children, then you should vote in favor of the motion: ""The U.S. Should Adopt the 'Right to Be Forgotten' Online."" Last remark: You already have it in some parts of the United States, in some parts of law. For example, in California, there is now a law which gives the po ssibility for parents to say, and children when they become 18, to wipe out everything until they were 18. In the Fair Credit and Reporting Act about your credit, information which is older than seven years, you can ask to be deleted. So it is already there in part, and the federal trade commissioner, Julie Brill just yesterday said, “ Wes, this is what we need in America, a right to obscurity. ” Thank you very much.",
against,"Thank you very much. My mission here tonight is not to persuade you that the internet is perfect the way that it is. My mission is to urge you to vote against the resolution. And unlike Paul, I am of the view that this so -called ""right to be forgotten"" in the EU is an epically bad decision, a travesty, an example of great moral and institutional failure on the part of the European Union itself. But my mission here tonight is somewhat more narrow, which is to secure your vote against the motion. As Jonathan alluded to, the emotional underpinnings of this motion, the emotional rationale that lies be hind the ""right to be forgotten"" is powerful. And it is understandable. There are many people on this planet that have made mistakes in their past, and the internet for them acts as some kind of a permanent record that follows them everywhere. And the fear that it generates is that you will forever be defined by that one mistake that you made, that ended up on the internet or in the press. The problem, though, is the following. And this is what I'm going to try to persuade you of. First, the ""right to be forgotten"" is, no matter how you try to construct it, censorship. Censorship has to clear a very high bar in order to be justified in a free and democratic society. The ""right to be forgotten"" does not clear that bar. There are vastly better ways to accommodate the emotional rationale for the ""right to be forgotten"". And that doesn't even really get into the implementation dilemmas, all of the different practical reasons why this thing will never, in any meaningful sense, become a right. So that's the outline of the argument that I'm going to make. Let me just begin with a key point, which is the ""right to be forgotten"" is censorship. Note the odd passive voice in the construction of the right: ""The right to be forgotten."" We call it a right, but really, it's a duty. And Paul owned up to this very directly in his opening statement. The ""right to be forgotten"" is a duty to be able to force other people to forg et what they would otherwise remember. That ability, that right to remember is one of the most fundamental rights I think of being a human being. By suppressing true information -- and let's be very clear, that is what we're talking about here. We're talking about the suppression of true information, not libel , not defamation, not hate speech. True information intrudes into our collective memory by trying to suppress the documents that constitute that memory. So, we're talking about the regulation of speech and, really, the regulation of thought which is ultimately what memory is. So, this is the right to force people to forg et true information. Paul said that this is a -- the way he framed it was that this is a right to control your ow n life, the right to demand deletion. The problem, though, is that I have the right to control what I remember. I have the right to control what I say. I do not have the right to control what you remember. I do not have the right to control what you say . And so for that reason, we must treat the ""right to be forgotten"" as it is, which is a form of censorship. So, as I said, censorship in a free and democratic society needs to clear a very high bar to be -- to be justified. The ""right to be forgotten"" does not meet that bar. First of all, it's way too prone to abuse. It is vague, it is subjective. The language in the European courts' decision is that information should be deleted from searches about the person if it is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer irrelevant or excessive. I challenge you to find a more vague and subjective legal standard anywhere in the law of a free society. It's very clear, by the way, as a practical matter, that this law favors the interests of well -conne cted elites in Europe, those who are wealthy, those who are in office, those who would like to suppress embarrassing facts about their lives. And -- contrary to Paul's claim that it's working kind of well, you can Google -- well, you can Google while you can -- any number of articles. The ones that I found were in the English language press in the UK outlining all of the articles that have been suppressed , because Google g ives notification to the publisher when an article has been suppressed. And so you will find crimes, you will find criticism, you'll find the case of the piano player who didn't like a 2010 Washington Post unflattering review of a concert that he gave. But there are many, many examples : a lecturer who was suspended got an article about that discipline -- disciplinary action suppressed; a man who tried to kill members of his own family was able to have those articles suppressed in searches about his name. And the se are from like 2010, 2011. These are not ancient history. So, one other point that I want to make is that the ""right to be forgotten"" undermines our moral standing, vis -a -vis dictatorships. In a society with steady rule of law, I suppose it's conceiva ble that you could have some kind of court mechanism adjudicate the ""right to be forgotten"" and come up with a body of case law that would define the bounds of the right, flush it out and so forth. But in most of the world, that's not the case. I guarantee you that the dictators in many parts of the world have a different view about what is relevant and irrelevant about their pasts than we have, and they would gladly use this right to suppress speech and to justify it in their own countries. S o , as I said before, there are better ways to accommodate this right. For example, in the American tradition, we believe in not censorship, but more speech. So, for example, if there are links on Google, a better solution might be to say that the subject of the search could add a link, add a comment, or add a symbol that would click you through to whatever you want to say about that link. You might have a right to respond as opposed to a right to censor. Moreover, we've seen that the internet adapts. We've seen the rise of applications like Snapchat , Wuut, W-U -U -T, which are applications that are designed to not be searchable and to facilitate communication without a permanent record being compiled and assembled. In other words, rather than scrubbing information embarrassing to a person, we might even think more broadly about, as a society, how do we treat past mistakes and past errors? Can we learn to broaden andembrace and allow for the self -reinvention that in so many ways define s what it is to be American ? That space for personal development and trial and error as you grow up can be accommodated if, as a society, we learn perhaps not to disenfranchise ex -felons for the rest of their lives, not to penalize them by ma king it difficult to get a job and so forth. And so finally, I'll just end on this note, which is that, you know, as George Orwell said, ""He who controls the past controls the future ."" G iving any number of individuals a vague standard by which to contro l their own pasts and thereby try to control their own futures has incredibly negative effects. This right is not necessary. I urge you to vote against the motion.",1.0
for,"I'd like to ask you to cast your minds back 25 years, 30 years. For those of you who are old enough, or some of the younger people here, I'll just have to tell you what it was like then, when we enjoyed something called ""privacy."" And privacy is a complicated concept, so I want to convey it to you with a few examples. So, imagine a 17 -year -old boy, he's arrested for selling drugs. A news item appears in the local pape r. The police then realize they made a mistake, and they let him go. That's not published in the newspaper. Now, the people around him in his neighborhood may know about this, they may not know about it. They know a lot about this kid. He moves on with his life. It's not a big deal. Second example: A single mom is depressed, she has -- her kids -- her hands full with her kids. S he sees a psychotherapist, she misses some credit card bills, files for bankruptcy. But bankruptcy gives her a fresh start. She gets back on her feet, and she's able to continue with her life. Now, again, her friends and neighbors might know a bit about this, but they also know about her and what she's like and how she is a good mother. So, they know a li ttle bit about what's going on but they still have a relatively complete image of who she is. A third example, a married couple has a terrible divorce. They file for divorce in court. They say terrible things to each other, flinging wild accusations, so me of which may contain an element of truth, some of which is exaggerated. They might refer to each other's infidelity. They might allege that the other spouse neglected the children or said bad things about them. Eventually the divorce is settled, and they move on with their lives. So, in all these cases, these events happened. They were public to some extent but at the same time they're private. Not everybody in the world or even outside this area hears about these events. And the law p rotects them. There are privacy laws -- there were privacy laws, they still exist. There are even laws called, ""expungement statutes,"" that would have allowed the teenager, for example, to erase his arrest record after a period of time had passed. And a lthough free speech was robust at that time, so were privacy rights. People understood that while other people would have an interest in knowing things about you and talking about you, individuals also have an interest in controlling information about the mselves, not necessarily political information, it could just be personal information, things that are embarrassing. Now, I want you to imagine back then in 1990 that an academic -- a kooky academic like me or Jonathan came up with the following proposal. We would say, ""This is a terrible state of affairs that we have,"" because, after all, if a stranger meets someone -- let's say it could be an employer or a creditor or a future romantic partner -- it's really in the stranger's interest to be able to know as much about this person as possible. Maybe a future employer would want to know that this kid had been arrested. Even if he wasn't convicted, it's still information that would be useful. So to solve this problem of massive social ignoranc e, what we should do is record everything that everybody does, put it onto a searchable database, and make this database available to everybody in the world. Okay, so if somebody had made a proposal, even someone like Jonathan, smart guy, or me, not so smart guy, we would have been laughed out of the room, that -- ""What a ridiculous proposal, what a tremendous invasion of people's privacy."" But, of course, this is what's happened. It's happened over the last 20 or 30 years, not because of a conscious dec ision by the publicor by the government to implement this crazy recording system, but because of the development of the Internet. Now, what happened? The law has remained the same, but a very important element of privacy back in the '80s and '90s and before then was simply the physical configuration of the environment. It was just very difficult to collect information about people and disseminate it. Okay . That's completely changed. Technology has changed. So the law at the time -- th e privacy laws at the time could be relatively weak, and yet people's privacy was adequately protected, but now, with this technological change, this old balance between my interest in controlling information about myself and your interest in knowing about me has been upset. And all that the ""Right to Be Forgotten"" would do is restore this balance . Okay, so, if we go through these three people again, this kid, 10, 15 years later -- let's suppose all of this happened, you know, in the last few years -- he applies for a job, the employer puts his name in Goo gle, first thing that comes up is this arrest. Now, the employer might understand that this is not important, but he might. This is the only thing that comes up about this guy. Why not pass him by and hire somebody else? Maybe the single mother's friends, you know, in the '90s they would have gossiped when maybe today they would write about it on Facebook. Maybe she would've written about it on Facebook or on a blog. Now a potential romantic partner, employer, neighbor, colleague puts her name in -- maybe she moves to a new city -- puts her name in and immediately finds out that she had a mental illness. That's how she's going to be defined to the public. And in the case of the divorced couple, in the old days divorce would be public. It's public information. But it was, you know, put in a file that was stored in the basement of a courthouse. If you wanted to, you could find out about that information, but nobody had any interest at least with respect to ordinary people. Nowadays, you know, their children could type their paren ts ’ names into Google and out comes these allegations. And, of course, not only their children, but future employers, romantic partners, friends, colleagues, anybody in the world, anywhere they go. So , they've lost control over this information about th emselves and it's not just that they've lost this control, they've lost the important context. You know, the neighbors, the people in the neighborhood, they know the context of these events. The strangers who do the Google search do not. So, the right to be forgotten would simply restore us, at least partly, to this older period of time. People were happy with the balance between privacy and speech in those days, and I think people would be happy with thisbalance again if privacy were improved somewhat. So, for that reason you should vote in favor of the motion for the ""Right to be Forgotten"" Online in the United States. Thank you very much.",1.0
against,"Thank you very much, John, and thank you all. I guess I should start with some points of agreement. So, if the question is are there problems with privacy ? Y es , there are. And if that were the motion I would hope you would join us in voting for it. If the question were have problems of privacy gotten more difficult over time ? We'd vote for that motion, too. I think I'm comfortable saying Andrew would vote for it. If the motion were should everything be recorded at all times and if so, should we do something about that? I would also be in favor, but none of these is the motion. The question is about a right to be forgotten and I want to explain my opening statement that that's a very bad solution to a very real problem. So, let's take an example. Imagine t hat there was something that I could say right now that would be not felicitous for someone in the world. That's not that hard to imagine. And this debate gets recorded, the podcast goes up, and at some point that aggrieved person files a dispute with Go ogle over the existence of this recording, the web page hosting it. Google will receive that request, that complaint, and it is bound not to tell anybody about it. Google then thinks about it. How does Google think? Companies don't think except with AI. Eventually this will be AI, but not yet. So, they have I assume some interns ? S omebody making $10 an hour that is just getting a stream of those 100,000 requests, it's like time to make the donuts, you're like yes, no, no, and Paul's like, you know, they've really learned. They've gotten good at this, and that's because if they don't grant the request, the aggrieved person can appeal in Europe to a data protection authority. I presume ther e'd be something similar here. That's bad. That's more process. If Google grants the request, that's it. Intelligence Squared wou ldn't be informed that their page is no longer findable through the world's most powerful information resource? There'd be no appeal by anyone else . A t the moment w hen it is granted Google notifies the Telegraph, for example, if a story on the Teleg raph is taken out of the Google index as a result of this right . The European Union is fighting that notification, because it observes when the Telegraph puts it out, here's what was deleted today, it kind of defeats the purpose of deleting it from Google. It has to be built into this right that we have no idea what we're actually talking about, which is why, oddly enough, as much as Google hates this gift, they're like looking at the box and it's ticking, I'm hoping they don't open it. I'm hoping they continue to fight it, because at some point they may make accommodation with it and when they do it will mean that the one protection we have had, apologies, Andrew, to your former employer, against Google basically running the world is that even Google doesn't know what comes up in Google sea rch results. It's a roulette wheel even to them, but once they cross that blood- brain barrier and start hand -tweaking results on request, like a DJ taking in what somebody wants, well, why shouldn't they just do it generally to improve things? And at that point the reality we experience will be one set by this company. And that's what's so strange. If there's going to be something taken out, let a court adjudicate it. Let it do so i n camera. That is to say in secret so the fact that it's adjudicating doesn't spill the beans. That should be extremely rare. It should be for corner cases, maybe for cases of the sort that Eric was br inging up. But it cannot be hundreds of thousands of things getting processed because it won't just be AI on Google ’s side taking it out, it'll be AI on the complainant's side. I'll write a check to somebody every month, a company that will go ahead, and every time it sees my name in what might not be a good light, it'll automatically file a request on my behalf, and I don't even need to be any thewiser. This starts to be eliminating the middle man so much that it eliminates us from the process of under standing the world. Now, I think I should end, then, by talking a little bit about the ecosystem in which this ill -considered proposal has its best shot at succeeding. And it's today's ecosystem. And basically, it's just Google. I'm like , “Bing , how many of you are getting ?” They’re like, “We can't tell you. ” It's like, “ Y ou can't tell us because there's so many or because nobody is bothering to take anything out of Bing? ” Apologies to Microsoft. But if we ended up with Wikisearch -- with -- do you remember Dogpile? It would do searches of multiple search engines at once. Does each company now have to start fronting a system to start taking stuff down? What if it is Wiki? What if it's a nonprof it? In fact, what if it's a Wiki page of Wikipedia that's taken down, and the page gets changed so the objectionable material is gone, it's been e dited out, it's been improved? Who goes back to undelete the hole in the Swiss cheese? The answer is no one. Until these questions can be answered, and maybe they can, back to you guys, I say, please vote against this motion even as you pluck a violin along with us for the very real problems that the for side is rightfully bringing up. We 've got to work on this stuff. Maybe court records shouldn't be immediately Google searchable. There should be some frame that keeps that cat a little bit in the bag. We can go case by case and try to come up with categories of information. But if we just stick with a generalized right for, in the words of the decision by the European court of justice, ""No longer relevant in the view of the complainant,"" information to be taken out and procedures that must, by their nature, be secret, we will be betrayi ng all of the great things that the information revolution has brought us along with the bad. Thank you very much.",1.0
for,"I heard this very clearly. This would be a tool for dictators. And our moral standing would be undermined if we allow this right to be exercised in democratic societies. I would see it exactly the other way around. History has taught Europeans, whether fascistic dictators or communist dictators they don't want any privacy. They wanted to know everything about you. There was a block reporter in every block of housing. And that is the history of this right you have to think about. Dictators don't want anybody to have privacy. So, I think the understanding where we are coming from is d ifferent, and I would like to , like Jonathan, distinguish this notion from other things you might be thinking about. The notion here tonight is not the US should adopt the EU ""right to be forgotten"" as ruled by the European C ourt of J ustice exactly.",2.0
against,"Well, that is censorship, right? So in this case, the law, which is an instrument of the state, is saying that the individual has the right to force deletion of true information published by ot hers. That's censorship. That is correct. I mean, I grant that the Google search result is different from the underly ing information, but unless you can find it, it may as well not exist. And search is how people get at things. Let me just give one example, which is one of the ones which was reported by the daily mail. They took out a link to a 2002 story that reported somewhat amusingly on a dispute between two families in the north of England over a terrier dog . And so that search result is now deleted as to that person mentioned in the story. So, again, this is true information. It did happen. The story reported on it, and now the EU says the individual mentioned in the story had the right to force the deletion as to them of that story. That's correct.",2.0
for,"You can just sue them and get money. And -- As a consequence -- As a consequence of that, journalists do not do this. Many of you have seen, on reality TV shows and other places that faces are blurred out. Well, that's a kind of censorship as well.",2.0

against,But that's not censorship. That’s a court action--,2.0
for,"the original -- Yeah, just that the -- there is censorship in the sense that the government prohibits you from reporting true facts. And the reason for that censorship is that there's also a strong interest in privacy.",2.0
against,"I wouldn't get too hung up on the word ""censorship."" I think that it's -- it should be starting a conversation rather than ending it. The key distinction in the examples Eric was giving was that these are adjudicated instances where the state is like, what that person h as said is so terrible they owe money. It might be a further move by the state with some trepidation to say, and you must say that again, and what you said must be, you know, stricken from the public record. That should be done very rarely and after a lo t of process. What's happening here, in a ""right to be forgotten"" implemented online is exactly the opposite. And in that sense, it's very different from the e xamples you're coming up with. The fact, too, that it's only coming out of Google' s index rather than the root thing being taken down, I would just see that as part of the paradox. If the thing is okay enough to stay up, it's not so bad that it needs to come down, it's like saying the book can stay in the library. We just have to set fire to the card catalog, like go to down, enjoy the stacks, to use an example from the '90s that you might relate to. That's just seems Borgesian.",2.0
for,"I can -- Here is another metaphor, so -- Well, for example -- Okay. So the -- so -- I agree -- I agree with Jonathan. I agree with Jonathan that the word ""censorship"" is not helpful here. What the""Right to Be Forgotten"" does is it raises the cost for strangers to find out information about you. It doesn't make it impossible. So, if you turn out to be a famous important person, become a politician, journalist s, biographers can dig it out. It just makes it difficult. But that's the way things work. That's the way we secure our homes, for example. We don't make it impossible to break into our house. That would be far too expensive. We put in a lock that will deter most people. It won't deter people who are extremely interested in getting into our house. That's -- so yo u raise the cost without making something impossible. That's a way of putting a thumb on the scale for privacy.",2.0
against,"I think what's -- you know, what's interesting about this to me is I regularly hear EU officials, you know, say, ""Look, there's just nothing much to see here,"" like this is -- only if you search for the person's name directly will that search result not ap pear. It's just a very small thing. And to me that actually highlights the kind of moral bankruptcy of this whole thing because they are essentially validating the notion that an individual, a dictator, a politician, a rich person can secure the deletion of irrelevant information, whatever that means, in this one very narrow way. And, believe me, I am confident that, that principle will expand. There's no way that it's just going to be left -- -- limited to search engines --",2.0
for,"Yes, I think what Andrew and Jonathan are do ing here is they're pretending that everybody who makes use of this right is someone with some public interest to know actually what this person has been doing and what it is about. But that's not the case. Most of these requests have -- more than 70 percent -- have nothing to do with public interest. So , I would like to say very clearly here, whenever there is a public interest of the nature which is impo rtant in a democracy to know, an interest in someone who stepped out, him or herself, into the public, the ""Right to Be Forgotten"" doesn't apply. The example,for example, which Andrew gave, from the Washington Post, namely that a concert pianist was asking for a takedown of the critique -- the bad critique of his piano performance here in America, yes, the person ask ed for it, but under our law it would never be right to take this down because this person ha ssteppe d into the public arena. So, I think hon estly we have a fake debate here. What we need to debate is the chilling effect on democracy and on public discussion. What chilling effect is bigger, if we are able to know everything about you and even in a way which you wouldn't even think of or whether we allow individuals to have control over the data. I give you one example what you're not thinking of today. You're not a very political person maybe but from time to time you push a like button on Facebook. Okay? Because you have political thinking and a little bit -- but you don't want to go out in public and say, ""I'm a Democrat,"" ""I'm a Republican."" Tomorrow Facebook will aggregate and map and link to your person the political profile from your Facebook buttons, whether you want it or not. That's the chilling effect.

for,"These complaints are generic in legal debates. Every legal standard is ambiguous, so these old privacy rights, for example, require the government or the courts or juries to balance the public's interest in something, a vague term. Relevance is a term that comes up over and again. So, this happens and what happens is through repeated decision making it becomes clearer and clearer what the actual rules are. Now, the rules as they're st ated are vague, but when you actually read the cases it becomes pretty clear what's going on. Ordinary people, non -famous people are the ones who win. F amous people don't win. Ordinary people, and not ordinary people who commit crimes or serious crimes, and there's frequently a time component, you know, five, 10 years ago, and you can, by reading these things, get a pretty good sense of what the standard is and be able to make predictions about how Google will apply these standards in the future . It's just something that happens over and over again in the law and people are able to work with it. Jonathan Zittrain : It happens over and over again in the law. That's what happens when cases are heard by courts. In public session decisions are reported and things evolve. Eric, I want to ask you directly, in this right to be forgotten when you have a private company making the decision at the insistence of the government it must keep its secret, the cases we hear about are happenstance, how do es that evolution take place?John Donvan: Let's -- can you defer to Paul? Paul Nemitz. I mean, these decisions have taken place since decade s in normal press law in Europe. Because before the Google case, as I explained to y ou, we had the right to deletion and, for example, you know, newspapers they have to make on a daily basis a decision do we publish something or not, and if they get a request, for example, to correct or to take down from a website some information, they have to make this decision. So, it's true that if you only read this one judgment, and that's normal in the law, you don't understand what these criteria mean. But if you go to European court of human rights, f or example, the Von Hannover case, very clear criteria. What are they? A) whenever the information is of relevant, of public interest in a democracy as a contribution to public debate, it cannot be taken down. Second, when the person in question has made himself or herself the dec ision to go public, into a public sphere like, for example, the concert artist, the information cannot be taken down. So, I would say Eric has said it right. All the many examples which you invoke of people who tried, I've heard here some examp les, the guy who did the professional the concert pianist who asked for critique to be taken down, all this under the law should not be taken down. On the other hand -- It is not different from any other newspaper previously. Newspapers have to make these decisions --",2.0
against,"Well, the heart of my argument is not that somehow it's only going to be used by the elite. I have no idea whether the majority of cases are being used by famous people or not famous people. I have no idea. My point is that this right is, in my judgment, a typical kind of like EU elite construction dressed up as a privacy right, but in fact designed to allow the well -connected, t he politicians, the business people to suppress embarrassing facts about their past. The record is -- wel l, it's part of my sort of cynical experience with the institutions of EU, to be quite honest with you. Let me say -- but let me say. And it's not like the US is any better, by the way. It's just the way that it take s form over there. What I would urge e verybody to do, while you still can, is Google ""right to be forgotten horror stories."" That was my search, and I produced a bunch of articles, the Guardian, the Daily Mail, that are absolutely contrary to Paul's assurances that this is somehow only being used in cases which are not in the public interest. Footnote, what is in the public interest, of course, depends on who you ask. So, for example, there is a story -- I'm just taking one at random here, where a Scottish premier league referee named “Dougie” McDonald -- there was an article from 2010 about how he was found to have lied about a penalty call that he made in a Celtics versus Dundee United match, the backlash to which prompted his resignation. That story is now subject to the Europe an ""right to be forgotten."" Jonathan Zittrain :Well, there goes this debate. It's now going to be deleted again. Thanks a lot. Let me make just one other point, though. So -- which is that I very much agree with Paul that what is in front of us here is a sort of a false choice. I disagree on what those false choices are. Paul has set it up so that we've got censorship and surveillance, or if you want to say it the other way around, free speech and privacy, and that these two things are intentioned and that we have to betray fr eedom of expression in order to vindicate privacy. I don't agree with that.

If somehow our exchange blew up and went viral, and then I felt bad about it. What are you going to do? But the idea that the recourse should take the form of going in front of Google and, in fact, I don't know, calling a few friends at Google and saying, hey, just so you know, I shot a request over. I'd really like you guys to give it its fullest consideration, there's no accountability.

If my social security number were published in a newspaper, I would have the right to go and ge t that deleted from the newspaper.

for,"It's not unconstitutional. So, the right of privacy already does this. It already has the effect of deterring newspapers and other people from publishing true facts about you. Expungement laws are statutes in most states that allow people's criminal records to be erased that, you kno w, the facts are gone. All of these statutes and legal norms have standards and criteria. This is something that we can debate about, how strict the criteria would be, and I suspect Jonathan and I, you know, are very close together, meaning that he's on our side. For the -- -- you make a -- you know, for example, I would completely rule out public figures from using the ""Right to Be Forgotten,"" only private individuals, and only private individuals who didn't commit a crime, that sort of thing. So , I do think we can -- that there are administrative criteria. Now, often it's very difficul t to set up in advance precisely because we're in a new world with new technology. And so you have to build it up through decisions. That 's how our legal system works. And I expect that's how it would work if the ""Right to Be Forgotten"" were implemented. Well, those are different context. That's in -- the Fourth Amendment is in the context of criminal investigations. And, yeah, there's a Supreme Court opinion which says what you said but I suspect will be revise d over time. These constitutional norms are not fixed, they are basically made up by the Supreme Court over time. And the Supreme Court has already signaled that it's going to reconsider many of these constitutional norms in light of new technology. There's a case inv olving GPS, for example, where the courts understand that their old norms don't work in a world in which the police can tail people with GPS rather than physically tailing them with cars. So , what the Supreme Court will need to do, going forward, is balan ce interests and free speech with interests in privacy.

And indeed, for your question on the NSA, the data protection law applies without difference to the state and to private search engines.

But of course, within reason national security limitations and so on, you know, there we are no t so far apart. Well, the answer is he described a case where he would, you know, as a developer for his private purposes design his own web engi ne, so this constellation would mean that you are not a controller, you would not be treated like Google and therefore the right to be forgotten would not apply in relation to you, because you're doing this as an i ndividual.

We need to have the internet evolve. I'll like to see Google evolve, to add a more direc t right to respond. And by the way, footnote, they've tried.

What he is trying to push is a right to force others to forget true information that they m ay wish to remember. It's that simple. It is an extreme solution to a very real problem. It's the wrong solution to a very real problem, particularly where there are other paths, more speech, a right to respond, new tools, the evolution of th e social understanding of past mistakes, to deal with embarrassing mistakes that come out on the internet.

We censor copyright infringement, we censor sexual abuse images of children, we censor a lot of differentkinds of information. But it's justified and overcomes a very high bar in order to stand as an exception to the right of free speech.

But you can see photo graphs where Stalin would fall out with one of his politburo members and, sure enough, the next time they published the yearbook or the history book or the textbook, the new edition would have them completely etched out.
