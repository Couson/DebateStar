I was very impressed, almost awed by what they were doing, the skill with which they were doing it, and the national service that I thought they were doing by supporting the First Amendment. My partner, I am very honored to be with one of the great civil liberties lawyers, and I mean this, in the country's history, Nadine Strossen. ",nan
against,"Well, maybe they're not getting it wrong. This is an issue that divides the free speech community, and it's a very, very hard one.

Oh, my teammate is my colleague at Fordham Law School, Zephyr Teachout.",nan
for,"  I'm delighted to be here at the National Constitution Center defending a proposition that is supported by the constitution's grand opening words. You all know them. ""We the people."" As those words underscore, we individuals are sovereign. Therefore, we have no right more essential than the right to engage in our own politicalspeech -- speech about public affairs, speech about political campaigns. As the Supreme Court put it, speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression. It is the essence of self-government. Especially essential is our right to criticize candidates, officials, and policies. Therefore, it's hard to imagine a greater violation of our precious free speech rights than for the government -- in other words, incumbent officials -- to limit our right to criticize them and their policies or to limit our right to advocate alternatives. It's likewise anathema for government to limit our right to band together with other like-minded individuals to amplify our voices. The Supreme Court first so held in landmark cases from the civil rights area involving the NAACP, which was a corporation. And from them, what I've said so far, individuals and our organizations clearly have a constitutional right to unlimited political speech. So, that means there's only one aspect of tonight's resolution that's really at issue. And that is whether we also have a constitutional right to unlimited spending in support of our political speech. But logically, the answer to that question clearly has to be yes, because unlimited spending is a pre-requisite for unlimited speech. When the government limits how much we may spend on our speech, it necessarily limits the speech itself, in quantity and or quality. Think about it. Suppose the government imposed maximum spending limits on IQ Squared or on the National Constitution Center or -- dare I say, on the Brennan Center for Justice? All of which are corporations, by the way. Those spending limits would clearly limit the amount that could be said by any of those fine organizations. Every communication requires some spending. And since costly TV ads are so important in election campaigns, you have to spend a lot to reach a critical mass of the voters. So, for government to limit what we may spend on our own political speech, including our criticism and our dissent, is for the government to limit our criticism and dissent. And that violates not only the rights of all of us dissidents, but also the rights of everyone to hear us. That point was well-made back in 1957 by three of the greatest, most liberal egalitarian justices ever to grace the Supreme Court bench -- Chief Justice Earl Warren, Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas. They were reviewing the very first federal law to limit spending on political speech. It banned such spending by corporations, and by labor unions on a rationale that we continue to hear, including from our esteemed opponents tonight, namely that these organizations are so rich and so powerful that they could be unduly influential. They could drown out others. But these justices resoundingly rejected that rationale as anti-democratic. As they explained It is we the people who are sovereign. It is there are vitally important that we the people have access to every view of every group in the community. After all, if there are any groups that are disproportionately powerful in the political process, it's the Constitutional media with their unique impact on public opinion. Yet we wouldn't even dream of letting the government limit what even the most powerful media company could spend on its political views. Even those who want to limit what the rest of us spend draw the line at the media even when they're part of conglomerates. But since media moguls have the right to unlimited spending on their political speech, surely it follows that the rest of us must have the very same right, otherwise it unfairly amplifies the voices of the rich and powerful people in groups who can afford to buy a media outlet. So that's just one of the reasons why spending limits actually undermine their stated goal, namely of leveling the playing field. Another reason is that spending limits favor incumbents and the two major particular parties, which should hardly surprise us because after all it's the incumbents who pass these laws. Now, our opponents are going to argue, and they already have, that these limits promote equality and integrity in our political system. Certainly these are extremely worthy goals. But as I've already noted, the goals are not in fact served. They are underserved by spending limits as Floyd will amplify on that further. For these reasons, please vote yes on the motion for unlimited political speech and therefore the unlimited spending that facilitates it and against government limits on what we the people may say and hear about it.",nan
against,"Thank you, John. I too am delighted to be at the National Constitutional Center. I too care about we the people. I like to think I care about we, all the people, not just the people that have enough money to be able to engage in the kind of speech that occurs when you have utterly unlimited amounts of spending. We can't consider this in a vacuum. We have to look at facts. We can't think about this in a bubble. In the last election cycle, $6 billion we spent on campaigning. Of that $6 billion, almost 99 percent came from 1 percent of the population with the capacity to spend enough money to be able to bring their views into powerful play in the electoral process. Of that, 1/10 of 1 percent contributed vast amounts, about $6 billion, many of it unreported because of loopholes in the discovery laws. And of that 569 billionaires maxed out in a way in which they contributed vast sums and spent vast sums in impressing the rest of us with their views. Now, that means a small group of Americans, super citizens, I call them, has the ability to decide who gets to run for office because there's a wealth primary. Unless you can convince the rich to support you, you cannot run for office. They have a disproportionate effect on who wins because they can control the speech patterns in ways that allow them to speak to the community in an effective way even though their opponents may not be able to do so. And they control what we see and hear because they set the agenda because if they don't agree, then they simply don't support the candidate in the first place. Now, every election is turned into a one dollar, one vote election unless there are some restrictions, some restrictions on what people can spend in asserting their own views. Now, it doesn't have to be this way. It's correct for us to talk about Constitutional law. What does the First Amendment actually say about the proposition that we're talking about tonight? It says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. We can't read it literally because that would mean only Congress would be president, not the governor, not the cop on the beat. So we don't -- we can't read it literally. And then it says, ""Shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,"" not abridging speech, but abridging the freedom of speech. Some human being must make a judgment about what goes in that protected category and what does not. So what fundamental mistakes have we made in saying that the freedom of speech gives the richest 1/10 of 1 percent of this country the capacity to dominate a democracy that is supposed to be one person, one vote? First, the -- we said that equality doesn't matter, that trying to equalize the rough ability of all of us to affect the political process is not an adequate basis for justifying limits, not saying thatyou can't spend anything, not saying that you can't even spend a lot, but saying that there is absolutely no limit. The sky is the limit on what you can spend. And if you have a regime like that, forget about any idea of equal political participation because it's a fiction. Secondly, the idea that spending money at astronomical levels, it equals speech instead of power I think is a fiction. When you start spending money above a hundred thousand, 200,000, 500,000, a million, 5 million, to push your ideas into the public, at some point you have got a loudspeaker that is louder than anybody else's. And everybody, I think, would say that the volume of the speech is not the same thing as the speech so that there has to be some limit on the up side or else forget about any idea of egalitarian democracy. And we don't have to say that speech equals -- that money equals speech. That was a mistake we made in 1976, and we can fix it. Third, the idea that corporations, profit making corporations -- and we have to distinguish here between nonprofit corporations that are essentially just a group of people that gather together to advance their politics in a corporate form and corporations like Citicorp or pharmaceuticals or the oil companies that are essentially collections of individuals designed to sell things for a profit where the money comes from investors, it comes from consumers, and it comes from shareholders. Why should the management of those companies that assemble vast amounts of money in connection with their commercial activity -- why should the managements of those companies be able to tap that money to advance their own political views in the give and take of an election? We made it much worse in 2010 when we took a system that said, very rich people could do that, and we parachuted in on top of it. Large corporations, profit making corporations without any attempt at distinguishing between a small corporation, a membership corporation like the NAACP or the Brennan Center or the ACLU, which is not in it for profit, and which has people that share their views and a huge corporation like General Motors.",1.0
for,"Good evening. I want to start with a point that Nadine made, which I don't think was responded to, and that is that without the ability to spend money, we don't have political speech, at least we don't have enough political speech to have a chance to win most elections. Look around this room. Imagine that this was not the national Constitution center but a political hall, but otherwise just the same, with all you people here. We couldn't have this event, we couldn't have a debate without paying for the lights, the microphones, the cameras, everything in the room. There are people here, I want to assure you not the speakers, who are being here tonight. And none of this could occur if people didn't spend money to back it up, to make it happen, to allow it to happen. Now, Burt talked about -- he used the phrase about ""One man, one vote."" We have never ever lived in a system of one speech, one person, or limited speech per person. We don't say that. We wouldn't imagine saying that to our newspapers or our media entities, however large they are. If you were to take Burt's point literally, you would say, ""It is -- we cannot persist in the notion that Rupert Murdoch can have all the money and power he has,"" or that the Philadelphia Inquirer could have all the power that at least it once had in Philadelphia and that it certainly does to a significant degree today. It's perfectly true to say that people with money have more influence and power than people who don't. That's the way of the world. How do we deal with that? We can deal with equality as best we can as a public. We can have laws. Some of them we have already. We can have better laws about people being able to vote instead of closing polls early in the day. We can limit the money if that's what we're after. We can have higher taxes. I'm not advocating anything today. I'm just saying it doesn't violate the First Amendment to have a wealth tax. It doesn't violate the First Amendment to crackdown on banks. It doesn't violate the First Amendment to have tougher antitrust laws. It does violate the First Amendment to limit speech. And that is what the negative side of this proposition necessarily is urging on you. Indeed, Burt did it. He is always straightforward. He was straightforward tonight. What is the argument? Too few people have too much power. And, therefore, what? They should not be allowed to speak as much as their money might allow, or, to put it differently, because they have more money and are prepared to spend it on political speech, our Congress, the very people who as Nadine pointed out have the most direct personal interest in passing legislation which will keep them in power -- that the Congress can pass Constitutional legislation limiting the amount of their speech. The Supreme Court put it very well in 1976 in the Buckley case referred to by Burt. I want to read you one line. The court said, ""The concept that the government may restrict the speech of some elements in our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment."" That's what the court said. That's what the law is right now. And I think it is a glorious articulation of First Amendment principle. And these were not the five supposedly rabid rightwing conservatives who gave us Citizens United. This was Justice Brennan, this was Justice Thurgood Marshall, this was Justice Potter Stewart, three of the most stalwart defenders of the First Amendment in our history. And what they were saying is, ""You can deal with problems in a lot of ways, you can deal with the equality problem in lots of ways, but the one way you can't deal with it is by shutting up the voices of others or limiting the voices of others, wholly foreign to the First Amendment."" This is one of the things that makes us so special in the world. I mean, it's only we, and we should be proud of it, but only we have a first amendment as strong, as totally controlling over what Congress can do as we do. So I would urge on you that while to some degree I understand that it seems not fair that people who have more money should have more power, if you want to deal with it, and we should sometimes, if you want to deal with that, don't deal with speech. One of the First Amendment principles that's first is hurt speech last. So, I urge you to vote yes on this resolution.  Floyd Abrams. And the resolution is this: Individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. And here to argue against this motion -- Zephyr Teachout. She is an associate professor of law at Fordham Law School and a former National Director of the Sunlight Foundation. Ladies and gentlemen, Zephyr Teachout.",1.0
against,"Thank you so much. I want to point out, first of all, that my worthy opponents both relied heavily on arguments about limiting the press from speaking. That's an interesting debate, but that is not the debate we are having tonight. There is a separate clause in the constitution, a freedom of the press clause, which is put in there to protect especially particular kinds of institutions that play particular roles in our democracy. What I do think we are debating is we're having a debate about reality and we're having a debate about history. Both of my opponents, very persuasively argue, but I would argue they mostly argue from abstraction. Burt started his argument talking about money and how it actually influences politics. And I want to talk about history, because I think this is a constitutional debate in the most fundamental sense. It's about who we are, how we want to constitute ourselves, and what our most fundamental principles are. So, instead of starting with a text of the First Amendment, sort of separated from its own purpose and principles, I want to return to the Constitutional Convention across the street, 230 years ago and look at the core purposes of the constitution itself, because only once we really understand the constitution and what it is for, and what it was for, can we understand the place of the First Amendment in it. I've spent a lot of time reading the transcripts of the debates of the Constitutional Convention. And I'll tell you, there's one fear -- the core principle is representative democracy. Figuring out a system where the public good could be represented. It's a really difficult puzzle. And there's one fear that dominated over every fear, and that was the fear of corruption. They talked about corruption more often than they talked about violence, more often than they talked about the threat of faction, more often than they even talked about this -- current problems of the day. The threat was that this beautiful new country would fall victim to the power of money to distract representatives from their job to tend to the public good, the same way that they had seen Britain do. Pierce Butler said, ""Look at Britain. You know, there we've built the fairest society ever. And yet, corruption has destroyed that fabric."" So, they weren't worried about some technical question of non-representative democracy. They were worried about how money -- in all these different guises -- could come in and take away this sort of precious young country. At the time, the concerns were focused around gifts from kings -- the king of France kept giving these really luxurious snuff boxes to diplomats. And there was a lot of anxiety that that would lead people like Benjamin Franklin to forget that his obligation was to this country and not to France. Another major concern was that people would go into office in order to get good jobs later -- or at the same time. Butler also said, ""A man takes a seat to get an office for himself, for his friends. This is the source from which flows venality and corruption."" If you look at the constitution, there's not just the First Amendment when it comes to money and politics. There's dozens of clauses. And each of these clauses is communicating that what the founders cared about was protecting against this thing which is the danger to all republics. So, when Alexander Hamilton was asked, ""What were you doing at the convention?"" he said, you know, ""Our job was to protect against -- but to create every practicable obstacle against corruption."" And Mason said, ""If we do not provide against corruption, we will soon be at an end."" For the next 200 years in this -- Courts understood that protecting against corruption was one of the core jobs of law itself. And so you would never see a lobbying case, lobbying was illegal in this country for a long time -- a lobbying case or a money in politics case without a serious investigation about -- of whether the laws that issue -- or the structures that issue might lead representatives to forget their obligations to the public and instead serve other masters. 200 years after 1776, in 1976, you saw courts starting to forget that. I'm not going to go into the full history here, but my objection to the proposition is not what's in it, it's what's not in it. If you can't talk about the First Amendment without also talking about why it's there and without also talking about the ways in which it might lead to money taking over this extremely precious and rare thing, which is representative democracy. So starting in 1976, the character of money in politics has gradually dwindled and become smaller and smaller in all our court cases until recently, in Citizens United and McCutcheon vs. FECwhere the great tradition of the First Amendment is weighed against basically a corruption which the justices call the same as bribery law instead of the old corruption that our founders understood. So I urge you to reject this proposition because so much is at stake; representative democracy itself.",1.0
against,"Well, the First Amendment is the central thing we have to think about. It is the text that the Constitution has that gives us the answer. But the answer is not self-evident in the First Amendment. It's not as though God spoke from the mountaintop, and we know that the First Amendment says that unlimited spending is protected under the First Amendment. The text itself doesn't say so. Our history for 200 years doesn't say so. The Constitutional convention doesn't say so. And representative democracy doesn't say so. So it's not that the First Amendment -- it's not that we have to get around the First Amendment. It's that they're misreading the First Amendment. Read directly, the First Amendment is democracy's best friend. And they are reading it as a kind of conspiracy to destroy it, and therefore --",2.0
for,"We apparently have very different views of democracy and -- And I think there's something extremely paternalistic and antidemocratic in the assumptions that both of my esteemed colleagues are making, that they're assuming that just because somebody spends a lot of money on ads that we the people are going to be duped and necessarily vote for that person? Or if information gets out that somebody has received a lot of campaign contributions and is voting accordingly that we the people are going to support that politician? The record speaks to the contrary. Look at Eric Cantor, Exhibit A, very recently vastly outspent his unknown opponent, was supported by all of the big corporate interests and yet that money was drowned out by the local grassroots people.John Donvan: Nadine, you're acting the pragmatics of what your opponents are saying, but they're also making the point that the text doesn't actually -- the text doesn't actually protect spending. But the text talks about ""Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech."" The Supreme Court consistently and correctly has said that any measure that abridges, i.e., cuts back on speech, makes it more difficult and burdensome to engage in speech is an abridgment. If you are told that you cannot spend as much money as you would like to speak as much and effectively as you would like, that clearly is an abridgment.",2.0
against,"Yeah, no, and I want to be just very precise about the way in which we imagine political reform working. It's not political reform mandated by the Supreme Court, but the public demanding a set of rules, Congress enacting those rules, and then the court, I would say, should only then intervene in these democratically demanded rules when there is something truly disturbing, some violation of the First Amendment which requires it, because the court itself -- It's not clearcut. She left out the three most important words. The First Amendment doesn't say ""Congress shall not -- shall pass no law abridging speech."" If that's what it said, they couldn't outlaw extortion, they couldn't outlaw bribery, they couldn't outlaw threats. It says ""Congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of speech."" The freedom of speech is not a self-evident idea. You have to figure out what goes inside the freedom of speech and what goes outside the freedom of speech otherwise why are those three words there?",2.0
for,"What you're missing is that the one area of speech which is most protected is political speech. There's nothing that we protect more than that. There's no area in which we give the Congress less leeway to act for a variety of reasons, not least that the single most important purpose for adopting the First Amendment was as a protection against the government, against the government influencing, affecting, limiting, chilling speech. That's why Thomas Jefferson, sitting in Paris, said he wouldn't support the Constitution at all unless there was a Bill of Rights which contained a clear, unambiguous -- what became the First Amendment.",2.0
against,"No, but Floyd, you're making two different arguments, and I want to separate them out, because one is a very important argument that I think we should pay attention to. When Congress passes laws that increase their own power or entrench their own power, we should be very wary of them, and we should be wary of them because it's abasic democratic principle against corruption, not because it's a first free speech principle but because it's an anticorruption principle. And then there's a separate principle which is embodied in the First Amendment totally distinct, which is the principle that we should be free from government censorship and government telling us what to think, whether or not we can say something about a particular invasion, what we think about a particular policy issue. And that is not threatened when -- That is not threatened when Congress passes a law saying that a corporation cannot spend more than $60,000.  I concede -- there's no speech here, you can't have speech anywhere. It costs money to run a democracy. The question is since it costs money to run a democracy, are we going to essentially say that the people with the money get to control the democracy -- -- or are we going to try to pass laws that say, ""Look, we have to figure out how to fund this thing""? But the way we don't want to fund it is to let the top 1/10 of 1 percent of the population have a disproportionate say in what democracy is --",2.0

And we're telling you, we, the government, the Congress, we're telling you we're not going to allow that. And it's in your interest. It's really pro-democratic that we're doing that.

That's their articulation of the problem. It just cannot, in my view, be plausibly argued that this is not a speech issue or not a freedom of speech issue. If you wanted to say to us, there are other interests you're not thinking enough about, or sometimes freedom of speech gets trumped by some national security issue or something like that, you know, we could have that debate.

And I think your question goes to this, if the First Amendment is for protecting dissent, let's talk about what unlimited money in politics is already really doing in the last four years and what it is really doing in the last four years is corrupting our system so it makes it impossible for candidates to actually do their best job and serve the public. And that's the reality, not the word dissent, but the reality, the political reality.",2.0
for,"And I don't -- I don't think the last four years reflect anything of the sort. I think we've had a lot of unpleasant disagreeable and, from my own political perspective, outrageous speech, but we haven't lacked for speech, and we haven't lacked for all sides being represented in a public debate. And indeed that happens more and more with the internet and more and more because it is easier for less and less money to get messages out. That's the reality. And more competition. No, and, first of all, there is a right to shout, ""Fire,"" in a theater if the theater is on fire. You want people to shout it. And by paraphrasing that the way 99 percent of people do wrongly, you miss the central point which answers your question, which is that only if the speech in that case is false and, therefore, it leads to a harm -- directly leads to a harm that can't be averted in any other way, then and only then may you restrict speech as a last resort. So if we could show that there was some harm that is definitely going to occur and can only be averted by restricting speech, then we can do so. That is exactly why we can have laws against bribery even though bribery is committed through speech, laws against extortion. But there has -- with all the trials there is no evidence that there is undue influence that causes this enormous harm that is positive. It's all speculative, that's why the Supreme Court has talked about the appearance of corruption. It's because there's no evidence of actual corruption.John Donvan: All right. Nadine, let's let Burt Neuborne respond to your point.",2.0
against,"So let me tell you the two harms, Nadine. The first harm is the destruction of political equality, the fact that we all know we live in a country now where it is a sham to say that we have a fundamental egalitarian democracy. We have a plutocracy that's run by the rich, and that harm seeps into every piece of our democratic fiber, including the alienation that turns people off from democracy and keeps people from voting in the first place. And the second harm is corruption, the corruption that Zephyr talked about, the fact that we have representatives -- who don't have to be bribed. They don't have to be in the same room and get a quid pro quo. A wink and a nod and a day at the country club is plenty of time to send the message that, ""We expect you to support us on this."" And I'll ask the last thing, whose telephone call do they take after the election, your telephone call or the guy that gave him $2 million? That's the corruption.",2.0
for,"And if you -- -- and I disagree with both of them. And let me say that -- so, again, we've had all these trials, there is no evidence, we're just hearing conclusory allegations here, but in 100,000 pages of testimony, and in these cases not a single instance could be proven ofthat kind of alleged harm, which is exactly why the Supreme Court has said, ""Well, we can recognize just the potential appearance or the risk of harm."" Another requirement, prerequisite, before limiting speech, as I said, is that the limitation is necessary. If there is a less restrictive alternative that will protect the values that are being asserted, prevent the harm, that's less restrictive of speech, you have to use that. And what we advocate, and the Supreme Court has upheld, is disclosure, immediately disclose, fully disclose where the money is. And we, the people, can be trusted to hold people -- politicians accountable accordingly. The -- well, my -- I'm sorry. I thought you were addressing it to us.",2.0
against," No, I would -- I also took some issue with the framing of the question. And actually, Floyd alluded to this. He said we might take a -- I might take a different stance if I saw that there was another value that was outweighed. So, I would -- might maybe frame it, you know, ""Do the people, through their representative electives, have the power to protect against corruption in ways that don't then infringe upon the core right to dissent and express one's views? or something else -- that I do think these framing questions matter a great deal. I understood the question to cover for-profit as well, and to be framed in a way to be -- for-profit, non-profit, and individual.",2.0
for,"Well, and it also covers not-for-profit, because I think I heard Burt trying to carve that out. And we --",2.0
against, I don't -- I don't have a problem with not-for-profits speaking.,2.0

for,"I want to answer that by saying -- -- if the government had a law saying that the amount of time for each of us must be equal because otherwise it just wouldn't be fair, that would be a terribly and obviously unconstitutional law. It isn't fair -- it isn't fair to have a situation in which we get -- I want to posit it in our favor now -- in which we get all the time and they get just a bit. But the purpose of the First Amendment I think is different than you think. One of the results of the First Amendment is more things are said, hopefully more people get educated. But we don't limit the First Amendment if people don't get educated or if less is said. The First Amendment is designed to protect us first from the Congress, the entity that they think should pass laws limiting speech. That's the beginning and almost the end of it.",2.0
for,"Tonight's debate ultimately turns on the following question: How much faith do we have in our democratic egalitarian ideals? Are we willing to assume, as our Constitution does, that our fellow citizens can be entrusted with the right to decide which speakers and ideas to accept and which to reject? Are we really going to trust we the people? Sure, many of us have a healthy distrust of powerful, wealthy people in groups. But no one has anything approaching the power or wealth of the United States government. Here's what--one judge put it this way: The government has unlimited resources for touting its agenda. Those on the outside must rely on private wealth to make their voices heard. So it violates democratic egalitarian ideals that we hear our opponents espouse for incumbents to limit what the rest of us may spend to make our voices heard. Basically you have government insiders trying to justify these limits on all of us, the outsiders, by speculating, well, maybe some people will have dangerous ideas, or they're suspect speakers because they happen to be organized in corporate form. And that might lead to some potential appearance of corruption. But that kind of paternalism has always been rejected in our free speech tradition. We can't say because speech might lead to a risk of crime that it can be suppressed, much less to anappearance of a risk of crime. And we've cited many examples where people -- it's as inaccurate as it is insulting and condescending to say that we are automatically going to vote for the candidate who spends the most money or trust the candidate who's in the pocket of high financiers. So please show your trust in the people by voting for the proposition.",3.0
against,"Please, show your support for the people by voting, because the people want these laws. Every single law that we're talking about are laws that were overwhelmingly supported by the people and overwhelmingly passed by a representative democracy. It is five members of the Supreme Court and a group of ideologues who are telling us that we cannot have these laws because there is some magic formula in the Supreme Court that tells us that our democracy has to be dominated by the rich. Floyd correctly -- because Floyd is -- has values that I share. We've worked together so many times. Floyd says there's many things wrong with this country, and we should fix it. We should fix our tax system, we should fix all sorts of things that are desperately wrong. And I tell you, we can't fix it. There is no way that fixing a system that is rigged in favor of the rich -- and if you allow the rich to control who gets elected to fix that system. Our system is broken. It's broken because a few of us have so much power that we can control what the rest of us do, not every time, of course not every election is dealt that way. But over time, and through most of what we do, the rich have an immensely larger political influence than any of the rest of us. And unless we can do something about dealing with that, unless we the people can pass legislation that will limit their ability to spend unlimited amounts to carry out their policies, those are the policies that you had better learn to live with because there will never be a representative democracy in this country that will change those policies until we change the power structure of how we run our elections.",3.0
for,"I want to close with a story and I hypothetical. Suppose we had a situation in which a not for profit or for profit company made a movie denouncing a leading candidate for the presidency of the United States. Suppose it were a crime for that movie to be shown on television, a crime for that to be shown on cable, a crime for it to be financed and shown in either of those places. That is what the Citizens United case was about. Those are the facts of the Citizens United case. It was a not for profit. It could have been a for profit. That doesn't change what this is about. This is a situation in which once you say that, look, we'll leave it to Congress to draw some lines, and they represent the people. Congress after all is doing the people's work in a representative democracy. Sometimes they are. The view of the First Amendment of Congress is Congress is dangerous. Congress is something we need protection against. Congress is something we have to be really sure doesn't get involved with speech of anyone. And in this respect, speech includes not just individuals but institutions, labor unions, corporations or the like. So I would urge you that we have really a wonderfully representative audience here tonight. And it is very important that that audience focus on the underlying value of the First Amendment. That value is keep the government out of speech areas. That's what the First Amendment is about. And I urge to you vote yes on this proposition.",3.0
against," I urge to you oppose the proposition, and I'm also going to tell a story, but it's a much more recent story. I started running for governor in New York on the Democratic party line about two months ago. And so I'm sitting in my office, and I have a staff of six. And some of our job is getting on the fundraising, and some of our job is talking to the press, but there's something that we talk about a lot. I happen to -- I was excited to hear you mention antitrust. I happen to care a lot about taking on the monopolies in our current system. So I am actively opposing the Comcast merger. So because it is 2014 and not 1973, what we talk about is what the risk in my opposing that Comcast merger means because of the potential millions of dollars that could be spent against my campaign, defaming me, telling all kinds of barely true things about me. So we sit in fear while we talk about that. And because it is not 1972, I'm not -- or I'm not Jack Kennedy, I have to worry about these things. I have to think about, ""What is it that I could say that the Koch Brothers could spend unlimited money on?"" I'd like to think it's not influencing me, but I will tell you it is hard for it not to influence you, it is hard not to say, ""I'm just going to pick one target and not tell the truth about those other targets,"" because you can feel the potential power of those incredibly wealthy interests wanting to spend money to keep me quiet. So I have a commitment in the campaign, but I have an emotional experience right now of the effect of money in politics, and that's the thing the founders talked about is, ""How do we make our representatives care about the public? And if we don't figure out the right relationship between money and power, we are moving towards an oligarchy, not a democracy, and that is the most unconstitutional thing we could move towards.""",3.0
