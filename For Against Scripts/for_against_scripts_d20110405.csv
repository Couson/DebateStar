for,"It is time to clip America's global wings. America's global ambitions, particularly in the last decade, have far exceeded our capabilities. It is more than we can afford, more than a trillion dollars on two wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. But beyond the fact that we can't afford it -- and my colleague, Larry Korb, will make that case, it is that we are not capable of doing it. We do not need to sit here and debate the rights and wrongs, the moral correctness or the lack of correctness of the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war. The fact is we undertook massive nation building exercises, and we did not succeed. In fact, I will argue to you that we have not only not helped the United States, we have undermined America’s national security. Now I want to be clear. Larry Korb and I are not isolationists, we are not against U.S. -- use of U.S. power in the world. When I served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia, I argued strongly for U.S. airstrikes against the Serbs who were attacking Sarajevo and civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and when those airstrikes took place, they combined with intense diplomacy, they brought a four-year war that had claimed more than 100,000 lives to an end. It was effective. Larry Korb and I support the intervention in Libya, and it is -- for the same reason that it is working in Bosnia -- it was in Bosnia and in Libya we had limited ambitions. In Bosnia it was to end the war, in Libya to protect civilians. We had allies in Bosnia, the Europeans picked up more than two-thirds of the cost of reconstruction. They’re doing much of the heavy lifting in Libya, and we had partners on the ground. That is not the case in Iraq or in Afghanistan. In the case of Iraq, we went in not appreciating the complexities of the government, and in the end, who ended up as the victor? Iran. For eight years, the Ayatollah Khomeini and the clerical government in Iran fought the Iran-Iraq War, at a cost of a half a million Iranian soldiers for the goal of installing, of getting rid of Saddam Hussein, and of installing in power Dawa and SCIRI, two Iranian-supported Shiite parties. They failed. In 2003, the U.S. went in, and who is it that is in power in Iraq but the Dawa has the prime ministership, SCIRI plays a major role. Talk about unintended consequences. In Afghanistan, the United States is embarked on a counterinsurgency, I want to be clear about the operation we took to remove the Taliban, to drive out -- to try to kill and capture Al-Qaeda was correct, morally justified, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, but that mission has now morphed into an exercise aimed at building a central government in a country that has never had a strong central government and a counterinsurgency strategy that requires -- if General Petraeus were here, its architect, he would say just what I’m going to say -- it requires a local partner for it to work. Our partner in Afghanistan is Hamid Karzai who presides over what transparency internationals described as the second-most corrupt country in the world -- number one is Somalia which doesn’t have a government at all -- is ineffective, illegitimate, having stolen his last election through massive fraud, and as a result, the strategy doesn’t work. We have invested billions in training an Afghan police force. Our idea is that by training an Afghan police force, they'll be partners who can provide security, and why do we train the police? Because that’s what we know how to do, but the problem in Afghanistan is the police are the visible face of a corrupt Afghan regime. The money that we’ve spent building roads so farmers can bring their products to market in Afghanistan isn’t working because, yes, the roads are there, farmers don’t bring their product to market because the police rip them off by more than the value of the market. We can train the police to be policemen, but we cannot make them honest. Afghanistan is also another case of the unintended consequences of our actions. We are spending this year $117 billion on the Afghanistan war. To fight an enemy, the Taliban, whose budget is estimated between $70 million and $200 million, and how do the Taliban fund themselves? From the United States. Why? Because to supply our military in Afghanistan, we bring in supplies to the Pakistani port of Karachi, they go throughTaliban-controlled territory. The contractors pay off the Taliban. And with the money used to pay for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, we ourselves are financing the Taliban. Now look at this from the point of view from the extremists. We can spend $70 million and get the U.S. to spend $117 billion. That is a pretty good investment. So, our position is simple. We need to scale back what the United States is doing in the world. Yes, to continue global engagements. Yes, to working with allies. But no to this ambitious overreaching. Yes to being smart. So, please join me in supporting the proposition that it is time to clip America’s global wings.",1.0

for,"What's not adding up is that the Republican Party has changed tremendously since the days of Reagan. Remember when -- in the Reagan administration, when we got into Lebanon, it didn't work, Reagan got out. He raised taxes 11 times when he recognized that supply-side economics was not working. He worked with members of Congress to reform the Social Security system that kept it in balance until this year. Well, I thought I would take advantage of it. My point is that even if you think the United States should be more involved in the world, the problem is right now we're broke. We borrow 41 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends. We borrow -- put it another way -- $4 billion a day. Now, if you go back and you take a look -- and I know our opponents don't want to talk about the previous administration. Go back to the beginning of this century. The beginning of this century, the United States accounted for one-third of the world's Gross Domestic Product. We spent one-third of what the world spends on military. Here we are today, we account for only one quarter of the world's Gross Domestic Product, but yet we account for half of the world's military expenditures. Five percent of the world's population, which is us, spends half of what the rest of the world spends on defense. Now, remember at the beginning of this century, we had a budget surplus. You may remember the lockbox and all of those debates back in 2000. That surplus was supposed to make sure that Social Security would not run out of money quicker than it has. Where did we end up at the end of this decade? Not with a surplus of about five trillion, but with a deficit of five trillion. And then, of course, when the global economic crisis hit, we had to increase the deficit even more. Now, the question becomes, how do we get there? Defense played a part. The war has played a part. It wasn't the only part, but I think it's important to keep in mind, in 1968, when we had 540,000 people in Vietnam, we balanced the budget. How did we do it? We had a surtax, a war surtax. What happened this time? You can be for or against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the fact of the matter is we went to war, and we didn't pay for it. In fact, what we did is we cut taxes. We've never done that in our -- in our history. And what happened? The wars cost -- the direct cost a little over a trillion dollars so far. But the indirect costs, as a lot of economists will tell us, we'll be paying for a long time. And Joe Stiglitz up here, a Columbia economist, estimates it'll cost three to $5 trillion. We compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget, what we call the baseline budget. General McChrystal, who everybody knows, I had the privilege of working with at the Council on Foreign Relations about 10 years ago. Before he went to Afghanistan, basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget. And he told me, when I spoke to him the last time, he said, we didn't have to make any choices. We could have everything. The baseline budget also went up during this particular period. Again, during Vietnam and during Korea which had war costs, we looked into the baseline budget of the programs that didn't contribute to our national security. Now, you don't think the deficit's a problem? Admiral Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it's the biggest threat to national security. And he says unless we get our economic house in order at home, we can't be strong abroad. Now, the defense and I agree with it. Wasn't the only thing. We as individuals live beyond our means. We all assume that housing prices were going to go up 30 percent a year. And, you know, we made our decisions on that basis. States right now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for the policemen, the firemen, the teachers, they assumed they would grow eight percent a year. Well, that didn't happen, and they're having problems. Now, the question becomes, okay,now we have these problems. Maybe we should still do a lot more in the world. And again, we're not against involvement. But it has to be selective engagement. You can't deal with every situation. But we've got a lot of challenges at home. You probably have seen all of the statistics. We're 15th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math. These are our children. Our infrastructure is falling apart. We're 27th in life expectancy. You know, right now, but we are ahead in a couple of things. Obesity is one, and we're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and the number of people who are below the poverty -- poverty line. And what we're doing, as a country, we're living off our past investments. If you go back and look where we are today, these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s. Now, can you cut defense? Yeah, you sure can. If you take a look at what we're spending on defense, and you put it in constant dollars, go back and look at the Cold War average, it was 450 billion. Right now it's 550 billion. How do I know it's too much? Secretary of Defense says $150 billion in inefficiencies. Well, we could take that money and use it to deal with some of the problems at home. And a couple of things, you know, that we could take a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are -- Secretary Gates, Secretary of Defense goes to West Point. We’re not going to send large land armies into Muslim countries again, okay? This is a man who worked for President Reagan, worked for President Bush, is now working for President Obama. Well, if you’re not going to do that, let’s take a look at the size of the Army and the Marine Corps. This is something that you can do. We also have to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved, nor can we solve them all. And I think, as Peter pointed out, I think Libya’s the perfect example of the way to do that. We used our unique capabilities, we got other people involved, and you know who’s a great example for this, the first President Bush. You may remember in the campaign, President Obama said, “I like President Bush,” and everybody said, “You do?” and he said, “Well, the first President Bush.” The first Persian Gulf War we got over 200,000 troops from other nations, and those who couldn’t send troops, we collected money. We collected so much, we actually made a profit on the war. So it didn’t cost us anything and, in conclusion, we’ve done it before. Eisenhower got us out of Korea, wouldn’t go into Hungary and Poland, or into Vietnam. Nixon got us out of Vietnam, started arms control with the Soviet Union, recognized China, and even Reagan, when he started negotiating with the Russians, you know what Newt Gingrich called him? Neville Chamberlain. Thank you very much.",1.0
against,"Personality counts because in any given time there are three or four or 10 heads of government around the world who are certifiably insane. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Listening to these presentations, here I am, batting cleanup here, and I’ve only got seven minutes to correct so many mistakes. You know the joke, the old, old, old joke about the guy who is looking for his keys under the lamppost and the man says to him, “Did you drop your keys here?” and the guy says, “No, but the light’s better here.” Why are we cutting the military budget? We’re cutting the military budget apparently because the military budget got us into the fiscal mess we’re in? Wrong, it didn’t. Let’s start with the fact that we are cutting the military budget already. It isn’t as if we’re in a situation where these global wings are spreading, and the military budget is becoming a gigantic -- I mean, Defense News, February, ""U.S. Air Force Budget Shrinks."" The Air Force, since we’re talking about wings, has been shrinking decade after decade. Armed Forces Journal, ""Tactical Inventory of the Air Force is as Small Today as at any Point Since World War II."" Many of you no doubt read every morning the website entitled, “War is Boring.” It exists. And it's said of the 2010 budget, the new budget includes cuts and additions. The Air Force took the biggest hits. Now, if you’re going to clip our wings, and in fact many of those wings are being clipped, you have to make some assumptions about the world. You have to assume that there will be no war on the Korean Peninsula. You have to assume there'll be no war between Israel and Iran. You have to assume absolute stability in Asia despite the rise of China. You have to assume no 9/11 attack on the United States again, that we wish to respond to. Are you absolutely confident about all of that, confident enough to reduce American power, that in one, or two, or five, or 10 years we may need? You know, the person who summed this up best was actually President Obama in his Nobel speech. “The world must remember that it was not simply international institutions, not just treaties and declarations that brought stability to a post-World War II world. Whatever mistakes we’ve made, the plain fact is this: the United States of America has under -- has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens, and the strength of our arms. The position the other side is taking is a very radical position, I mean, well to the left of President Obama. Now, we have been spreading our wings for some decades as Eliot mentioned. The world is a better place for it. Peter mentioned some of the places where it is a better place. Bosnia was, I think, the example he used. Take a look at Asia today. It’s an interesting thing. You don’t hear the South Koreans, the Taiwanese, the Vietnamese, the Singaporeans, the Indians saying, “Hey, it’s time to clip your global wings,” because they’re afraid of China. And they want our help in balancing a rising China. Look at Vietnam. Some of you will remember the Cam Ranh Bay Naval Base that we had during the Vietnam War. Now -- now, the government of Vietnam has asked us to come back. Their defense minister was quoted as saying, “This port should be a fuel stop for aircraft carriers.” Well, they don’t have any aircraft carriers. He means our aircraft carriers, that they weren’t stopping there to counterbalance China. The idea that we need to diminish the size of our military -- let me quote from a famous American. Getting the Democratic nomination in 2004, John Kerry said, “I will nevergive any nation or institution a veto over our national security, and I will build a stronger military. We will add 40,000 active duty troops.” That’s John Kerry. These guys are taking a position well to the extreme on these questions. Now the finances. “We have to cut the military budget because we’re broke.” Bill Clinton’s budget director, Alice Rivlin, wrote last week -- last month, excuse me -- quote, “Defense spending is not a cause of the growing projected deficits. It’s the entitlement programs that drive future spending up faster than GDP can grow.” Clinton budget director. The deputy secretary of the Treasury for Bill Clinton, Roger Altman, “Imperial overstretch is not the real issue here. It is fiscal, economic, and political failures at home that are threatening the ability of the United States to exert global influence.” The defense budget has been falling as a percentage of GDP for decades. It’s falling under four percent now. It is scheduled in the next five years to go under three percent of GDP. So what’s the argument they’re making? Really, it’s ideological. American power is bad. Well, that’s not exactly the argument. Peter tells us American power in Bosnia was good. So I guess what it comes down to is this: When is American power bad and when is American power good? Just ask them. And they’ll tell you where we need to intervene and where we don’t. Doesn’t work. If the United States is going to reduce our global wings, if we’re going to reduce our power, we’re going to put ourselves in a situation where we cannot do what we need to do around the globe. Now, who benefits from this? Who benefits? Who benefits if there are more Srebrenicas and Darfurs and Rwandas? The answer is people like Gaddafi and Milosevic and Bashar al-Assad and Saddam Hussein. They benefit. We do not and the people who depend on us and our power for their safety in a very dangerous world, 300 million Americans and hundreds of millions more around the globe. We’ll lose. Do not buy this picture of America that doesn’t exist, with a people and a military and a president just lusting for intervention everywhere, and a military budget that must be decimated if we are to be safe. On the contrary, if we are to be safe, and if the world is to be safe, those global wings need to be strong. Thank you.",1.0

You’re committing American prestige and money. But I don’t think that can be an argument for inaction. It can’t be an argument for saying, “We don’t really know what’s going to happen tomorrow in Srebrenica. Let’s not go in. We don't really know if Saddam Hussein will massacre the Kurds. Let's leave it alone. It takes you too far.”",2.0
for,"Well, I think the question of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan's a very good one because we simply allowed the Pakistani dictator, Zia-ul-Haq under the Reagan administration, to decide who to fund. And he funded the most extreme elements. And we are now living with the consequences of that. I want to come to the question of, you know, should web in the business of nation building, building democracies? Yes. We had an interest in removing the Taliban. We had an interest in trying to kill or capture al-Qaeda. What interest did we have in trying to build a strong central government in Afghanistan, a place that has never had one and will not have one in the lifetime of anybody sitting in this room, even young people? John Donvan:Okay. I -- What interest did we have in -- Since you used a metaphor here, there's a great book written by a professor here at this wonderful university, Peter Beinart. It's called “The Icarus Syndrome.” And he said throughout our history, we get carried away thinking that because of who we are we can solve all the world's problems. And he goes back, and he talks about Vietnam where we went in, we thought the domino theory and all of that type of thing, found out we even -- when our economy was much better, we still could not achieve the objective that we wanted. And that's what -- you used the term, you've got to be smart about it, there are certain things you've got to do, other things you realize that they're beyond your capacity. And I think that's the key thing. Now, at this particular time, we talk about the fact that defense has nothing to do with it. No. We added $2 trillion to the deficit in the last decade because of actions that happened from 2001 to 2008, okay? If we had those $2 trillion, the other problems would not be as bad. And so that's the point I'm making.",2.0

And Churchill said -- wise thing. He said, ""You know, my view is the eagle's head should be mounted on a swivel."" So it can look either at the olive branch or at the arrows as is necessary.

for,"I was -- I'm glad you asked the question because I was just writing down some bullet points on exactly this. First, I think when we intervene, it's very important that we operate with the vision of the people on whose behalf we are intervening, not ours. I think that's my main critique of what we've done in Iraq and Afghanistan. Why did we want to disassemble Kurdistan and Iraq? It worked. Why build a central government? But that would, to me, be the most important point. Second -- And finally -- finally, as a Vermonter, I have to say, turkeys have very strong wings. We have lots of wild turkeys.",2.0
against,"Yeah. I -- First thing I think when you're talking about the use of force, the question is always, are we going to avoid something worse. And I think that it's important to be very serious about this. Using force is a terrible thing. You're going to kill innocent civilians. You're going to make mistakes. You'll probably get some of your own people killed. And those are real people. Are you going to avoid something worse? That's really the fundamental reason why we do go to war, and we should go to war. Is this doable as far as we can -- as far as we can guess? And it is a guess. Is it in our self-interest? And is it in our broader interest as Americans? From the very founding of this country, we're caught between the tension between the same kind of interest that other countries have and our ideals. That's what it is to be an American. And it's incumbent upon our leaders to wrestle with that and to lay it out for us. But above all, at the end of it, don't think that any of us can come up with a set of rules which we can, you know, give you, and that's a sort of a decision making guide that any president can take with him or her to make a decision. I would critical question here. And I think Elliott is right in saying when we intervene militarily, the chances are that some innocent people and some American servicemen and women will be killed. So the question is to what end? And if the answer is, I'm not sure, you don't do it. If the answer is, to save a million lives, or 500,000 lives, to stop Darfur, to stop Srebrenica, then the balance may shift.",2.0

They don’t get to that level if they were easy, and so there are always going to be -- there’s going to be an element of guesswork, and then an element of risk. The other thing, by the way, is we have really focused, because this is the preoccupation of the other team, on these high end interventions. There are other kinds of things. Let’s talk about the Sudan peace process, let’s talk about what’s been really quite a tremendous success in Columbia which has been an exercise of American power in many dimensions including the nonmilitary, this is not a debate about American military power, it’s America’s global wings, and those wings include a lot of nonmilitary elements which have been tremendously successful.

They would love us to be there forever, keep spending all of this money and help their a foreign policy objectives. They’re a free rider in the Middle East. We’re doing -- what’s China doing? Sitting back and taking advantage of it. So I think our point is that, you know, when you say clip your wings, you’ve got to work with the rest of the community. We can’t have too many free riders. It’s very interesting when the deficit came up in Britain and France, they cut their defense spending. They cut it. And then, of course, who has to pick up the thing? We do. Well, I’m glad that President Obama said, “Wait a second. You have more interest in Libya than we do.” And I’m glad that the international community did it. So, I think you’re going to look at China.

And the main thing we were talking about, particularly with the defense and foreign policy people are these little islands called the Senkakus, which have been Japanese territory for a very, very long time. The Chinese have a claim. And, of course, it’s not so much that they care about the islands. They care about the territorial waters and so forth. And the Japanese are under a lot of pressure, and they are actually quite fearful about the possibility of a Chinese grab for those islands. By the way, the Chinese really do say, “That water is ours.” Japanese do not – then most certainly do not want to see America’s global wings clipped. And I assure you that today they want it even less, when 18,000 American servicemen and women, 22 warships of the United States Navy are helping that country deal with the worst catastrophe that it’s faced since World War II.

for,"Well, the problem is that national security resources -- money, troops -- are not unlimited. And so you have to make choices. And if you make choices to deploy them in Afghanistan in pursuit of a strategy that, on the face of it, isn’t working, those resources are not available to deal with other threats or other national security issues, be it China, be it North Korea, be it Iran. And so, when we talk about clipping America’s wings, what we’re really talking about is not making -- removing American from the world stage. We’re talking about moving away from very ambitious exercises in nation building -- Afghanistan, Iraq are two cases in point -- to a selective use of power so that we can -- a selective use of these scarce resources so that we can focus on the real challenges. That’s all. I think you make actually quite an important point, which is that we’ve had this go-it-alone policy in the world, which has been very expensive as Larry Korb has made the point. We’ve had a lot of free riders on it. And the end result has been diminishing, particularly in the last -- in the previous administration, diminishing America’s influence in the world. And so one of the ideas of not doing these kinds of things, being selective, having a sensible defense budget is we might actually be able to devote resources in ways that would increase our influence in the world. You know, we were totally isolated on the issue of global warming. Everybody else recognizes this as a problem. But the previous administration didn't. Now, you know, the U.S. is back in the mainstream. We didn't need to pull out of Kyoto. We could have consulted. And there are all sorts of other issues, free flow of technology, things that are very much in our interest where, if we go it alone, other people aren't just -- aren't going to go along with us.",2.0

Another thing that's going to hurt the influence of this country is if we are fiscally irresponsible, and we are broke, and we are borrowing billions and billions of dollars. But I don't know what else I can do except to quote all those wonderful Clinton officials who say it isn't the military budget that is exploding. It is the entitlements that are exploding. Nobody wants to hear that, but it's a fact. And we have to deal with it. Least of all, do politicians in Washington want to hear it. That's what we need to deal with to make our economy sound. We've gone it alone. I visited German soldiers, British soldiers, Canadian soldiers, Norwegian soldiers, for that matter, New Zealanders, Australians and Danes in Afghanistan.",2.0
for,"No. And I think basically Obama did it exactly right. The cost to put ground troops on there was too great. The cost to the American defense budget and the taxpayer in terms of doing it all by ourselves was too great. So basically, this operation after the first week is costing us $40 million a month. Basically, that's affordable. How much is Afghanistan costing? How much is Iraq costing? That's what I'm talking about, you've got to do the -- you know, do the cost benefits. And he decided that, yes, we would like Gaddafi to be gone. Every -- we'd like a lot of these people to be gone. But in terms of the cost to do that, it would -- to put ground troops on and all that was just too great. And I think we have actually moved away in our military strategy the way we were doing it in Yemen with the Special Forces and the drones, the way we're doing it in Pakistan and the drones. That is a cost benefit way to do it rather than sending in large numbers of ground troops. Well, here is the problem. We have this huge investment in Afghanistan which is because, as actually happened, the September 11th tax began there. However, we're not really -- we're not fighting al-Qaeda there. We're fighting a Pashtun insurgency. Al-Qaeda is now present in Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen and probably certainly more present in probably in Europe than it is -- Yeah. You've got to confront these violent extremists basically not by killing them. Rumsfeld said you can't kill all the terrorists. Basically, what you have to do is undermine their narrative. And by going into Iraq, which turned out to be for the wrong reasons, you enhance the al-Qaeda narrative. And so I think what we have to do is live up to our values at home, and that will help. I mean, Peter was talking about the fact that the American opinion around the world has gone up. That's important. That's how you're going -- you're not going to be able to kill them all. You have to undermine their narrative. You know the American opinion in the Muslim world went up when we -- after we helped the people in Indonesia. John Donvan:But how does that relate to a more modest exertion of power? Well, it means you don't use your military to do it. It's basically you live at home -- Yes, yes, I am saying that, yeah.",2.0
against,"Well, I guess my first thought is, a moment ago you were all in favor of targeted killing in Pakistan and Yemen, so, I mean, that’s -- I’m in favor of living up to our ideals at home, but you were in favor of drones, let’s remember what those drones do. Secondly, I very much believe in American soft power, and that’s what we should be exercising to the best we can in places that are likely to be the incubators of radical Islam, that means being more involved in places like Indonesia to take just one case, rather than less. I mean, again, remember what this proposition’s about. This is not a debate about the use of military power; it’s about America’s global role. I would just add here, you know, living up to our ideals at home is not going to end the threat of Islamic extremism. One of our ideals at home is equality for women, and the more we live up to that, the more they’re going to hate us because they don’t believe in it. So that is not a solution. I think there is a one solution, but a key part of it as Eliot just said, is what we do in those countries. I can’t think of a better thing to do than support the expansion of democracy through soft power, not by invading 15 countries, but I think that what is happening now in the Middle East with the Arab revolts, is just killing al-Qaeda because we see what people in those countries want, they want democracy, they want free elections, they wantan end to censorship and the secret police, and al-Qaeda isn’t even addressing any of those things. So the expansion of democracy in the Arab world is one of the best things we can do to fight al-Qaeda.

Well, guess what, it wasn’t America’s decision to be made. It had been made a decade before by the Iraqis, and that really comes to my point. This world, it’s not all about us. It’s about -- what’s happening in the Middle East is not because they sat down and they read Jefferson or the Federalist Papers. It is an indigenous movement of people in the Arab world, and it’s terrific. But it isn’t because of something that we’ve done or not done. But we have the potential by intervening, as we did in Iraq with an expansive nation-building exercise, as we’ve done in Afghanistan, as we’re still doing, try and build a central government where none has existed, of undermining our credibility of wasting our resources. We have to remember that military power is not the end-all and be-all of power. Power is a lot of things. Influence doesn’t always come at the point of a gun. It may relate to your prestige. In 2000, America’s prestige was sky-high, again, after Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. We had a lot of influence in the world. We exercised a lot of military power in this last decade.

I just want to read five sentences. “There will be times when our safety is not directly threatened, but our interests and values are. Sometimes the course of history poses challenges that threaten our common humanity and our common security: responding to natural disasters, preventing genocide, keeping the peace, ensuring regional security, maintaining the flow of commerce. These may not be America’s problems alone, but they are important to us. They are problems worth solving. And in these circumstances we know that the United States as the world’s most powerful nation will often be called upon to help. But let us also remember that for generations we have done the hard work of protecting our own people as well as millions around the globe.” That’s President Obama, and he’s right. If we are to be safe, if we are to be free, we really can’t escape the world as it is. We cannot escape the need to have and sometimes to use military power. On the wings that you’re being asked to clip ride the hopes of hundreds of millions of Americans and many more people all over the globe, hopes for freedom and security, hopes for a better future -- for the sake of those people, for the sake of their freedom as well as ours, reject this proposition.

You remember the humble foreign policy. That’s the point we’re trying to make. Let me quote from another Republican. “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signified in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” If you take a look at what the Republican Party today, if you look at Paul Ryan and what he’s proposing, he wants to increase defense spending and then cut the things that are not going to help us improve our standing in science, are not going to help us be more competitive in the world. And what we’re opposed to, by clipping the wings, is to get over these reckless military adventures that we’ve undertaken in the first part of this century, something we hadn’t really done since Vietnam. And let me conclude with this. You’ve heard all the apocalyptic scenarios. I remember when people said, if you got out of Vietnam, all Southeast Asia and Communism and all that kind of stuff. Elliott meant you were going back to Cam Ranh Bay. I spent a little bit of time there, you know, about 40 years ago. Why are we going back? This is the people that we basically recognized we could not make them what we would like them to be. But they're doing okay now. And I think that's the point we want to make. We can't do it all. We're going to have to clip our wings when something happens. But look inside all your clothes and things like that. Go down to Nike and find out where your running shoes are made.
