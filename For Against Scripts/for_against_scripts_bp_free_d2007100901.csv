for,"John, thank you very much, and thank you for coming tonight, and Bloomberg, thank you for hosting the debate on the issues. Ideas have consequences, and debating ideas isalways important for a free society. Since the Enlightenment it has generally been accepted that limited government is the key to freedom and that freedom is the key to unleashing human potential. Freedom has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things, and America is proof that freedom works. Across time and across nations the countries that were freest have tended to create more jobs, more growth, more opportunity, and more human happiness. Within our own country states that spend less, tax less, and do a better job of providing the rule of law have tended to grow fastest, to create the most jobs, and to have the most end migration where people vote with their feet for less government and more freedom. When economic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes. And our argument tonight is pretty simple. Our economic freedom is imperiled. Just two years ago the national debt of our country was 40 percent of our annual production. Two years later our national debt is 60 percent of annual production and under the current budget that Congress is operating on by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90 cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually by America. Interest payments on our national debt will quadruple in the next decade, and even if every assumption of the Obama budget proves valid, within 10 years it will take 40 cents out of every dollar of income taxes collected in America just to pay interest on the federal debt. If the Obama assumptions prove invalid, it could take as much as half of all income taxes collected in America in the year 2020, just to pay interest on the debt. If this is not a threat to our economic freedom, what is? What could be? This is big government stifling the American spirit. But the crisis is so much greater than these frightening numbers would lead you to believe. If you listen to Washington, this problem is easy to solve. All you’ve got to do is tax rich people. Well rich people already pay more of the taxes than at any time in American history. And the problem is there are just not enough of them. Our problem is if you every penny earned by every person or entity in the top one percent of the tax bracket, you couldn’t deal with our deficit, much less our debt. And it’s not reassuring to look at the fact that with tax rates as high as 70 percent we have never collected more than 19 percent of gross domestic product in taxes in peacetime in American history. You often hear the discussion about the top one percent as if these were rich people. But the reality is that since 1980, when we lowered marginal tax rates, small and medium size businesses have changed the way they’re taxed from corporate entities to being taxed as individuals. The finance committee has estimated that as much as two-thirds of all theincome of all the tax returns filed in the top one percent of income earners comes from partnerships, proprietorships, pass-through structures, and sub-chapter S. In short, from small businesses filing as individuals. The policy that we’re told will tax John Q. Astor in reality will tax Joe Brown and Son Hardware Store, and here’s the rub: in recoveries, small businesses create two-thirds of the jobs. It is simply not feasible, given where we are in the economic cycle, to be raising taxes on small business. The solution to excess spending is not excess taxes; it’s less spending. If you’re in a hole and you can’t get out, the first thing you need to do is stop digging and stop digging now means stop spending. But if we can’t get our government to stop spending, how are we ever going to get them to reduce spending, to reform entitlements, to address Social Security, to address Medicare, to address Medicaid? Well let me suggest that we not give up on America and that we not give up our own confidence in the system. It’s important to remember that we overcame 10 percent unemployment, double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, economic stagnation, malaise, self-doubt and the Soviet Union in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. It seems like an eternity ago but remember, a Republican congress worked with Bill Clinton to reform welfare and to balance the budget and to put America to work. We did it once. We can do it again. But we can’t do it with the same old programs and the same old politics as usual. Thank you all very much.",
against,"Thank you, and I’m honored to be part of this debate. And I should say that I was inspired to a world of debate by my son, who’s in the audience, who has devoted much ofhis college and high school career to debate. So I hope I do a good job as a debater. How big should the government be, is my question. And I think that depends. It depends upon the tasks and the challenges that government undertakes. It depends upon what its citizens want the government to do. The government in a democracy is us. We cannot blame the government. We have to look to ourselves. And one of the main points I want to make tonight is we don't do it. We refuse to do the arithmetic. We want the government to do a lot, and we don't want the government to pay for it. Now, let me start with the government and the tasks right now, because part of the introduction here was, is the government stifling the American spirit right now? I suggest we be students of history here. The U.S. has just gone through one of the world's largest financial crises in economic history. We know a lot about financial crises across our own economy over time and around the world. And we know that they are the result of a failure, a collapse, a mess created by the private sector, created by overleveraged banks, created by people who take on debt they cannot finance, created by people who engage in sophisticated trading, buy a credit default swap, don't even know what a credit default swap is. Think I'll buy one; it's an innovation. When you have a major financial crisis and the recession which follows, the government has to help clean up the mess. And we know this over time from the tulip crisis of several hundred years ago to today's financial crisis. And we know -- you know what we know? That when government's clean up the mess, that is stabilize the banking system, that is make sure demand deposits are there when you go to the bank, make sure your money market funds don't fall below a dollar, the government has to supply capital to the financial institutions to do that. The government has to also deal with the slowdown in the economy, the recession, the loss of job, the bankruptcies, the closures of plants. And that is what economic stimulus is meant to do. And does it work perfectly?  Does it work?  If you look at what government has done, and you look at the projections of any macro model in the U.S. economy, you will see that the stimulus was projected to produce about 3.5 million jobs. And that's exactly what it has done. So one thing I will say is that we are dealing right at a moment in time where we have a mess that has to be cleaned up. It's a little bit -- I think of it more broadly as governments have to clean up messes occasionally. For example, let's take Katrina. Let's take Hurricane Katrina. There was a failure to clean up a mess that was a government responsibility to clean up. And by the way, one of the reasons Hurricane Katrina caused so much damage, there was another government failure. The government didn't spendenough on the levees. The American Civil Engineering Society warned, D minus, for U.S. infrastructure on the levees. We failed to spend. We invited a natural disaster. We failed to clean up the mess. Second area where the government, I think, has a role to play. Think about the innovative spirit of the United States. Think about technology. Think about higher education. Think about NYU. Think about the University of California. You will see that education, higher education, investments in technology, the things that build America's innovative spirit, these are big parts of what the federal government should and does do. You love social networking? Trace it back to DARPA. You love the latest biotech drug? Trace it back to the National Institute of Health. You like traveling on jet aircraft? Trace it back to the Department of Defense. There are many ways in which the U.S. government has spent over many years to build education infrastructure and technology which play into the spirit of America. They are part of the innovative spirit of America. Now, there is a problem. A problem is that the government has, over time, been spending less on that as a share of total government spending. And it's been spending less on that as a share of our economy. Our economy's gotten bigger. Those kinds of government investments have become less important as a share of the economy.  What's going on? Well, one -- let's look for a minute at defense, because when we're thinking about the size of government, think about defense in the U.S. The U.S. has 4.3 percent of the world's population and spends 43 percent of global defense spending, 43 percent, almost half of the world's defense spending is spent right here in the U.S. We are defending the U.S. And we're not just defending the U.S. We are defending much of the rest of the world. We don't hear about that from the critics of the size of government. We need to talk about the government spending almost 20 percent of its total budget on defense, it spending much less on innovation, education, infrastructure, failing infrastructure. Now, let me just get to a couple facts about the size of government comparatively speaking, because you might say, God, the U.S. government's so big. U.S. government as a share of GDP has really not changed very much in the last 20 years. Actually, I heard the applause for Ronald Reagan, President Reagan. Government spending under his term actually rose to about almost 24.5 percent of GDP. It fell under President Clinton and under President George W. Bush. So, presidents do have different ways ofhandling this. But the point is the U.S. has been spending in the past 20 years about 20 percent. The government has not gotten bigger. And by the way, government spending as a share of GDP or government tax revenues as a share of GDP, if you look at the most competitive nations in the world, and you line up the U.S., you will see that the U.S. is one of the most competitive nations in the world. But -- there are many other nations that do as well as the U.S., but they do it with much higher levels of government spending and taxes as a share of their GDP. They're innovative, they have spirit. They're competitive. They're growing rapidly. Their governments are a whole lot bigger. I see I'm running out of time, so let me say the final thing because I think this is very important to think about. I'll bring this up in my comments. I started with the view that the government is us. The biggest area of growth in the U.S. government is entitlement spending. Entitlement spending is Social Security and Medicare. You ask Americans if they like it -- Yes. I will say they like it. They don't want to pay for it. ",1.0
for,"The first thing I have to do is lower this microphone a little bit. You're pretty tall, Phil, but -- and in the other sense, I'll keep my comments short, if you know what I mean. Now, you told me I had to start off with a little light something or other. And I was talking to my granddaughter, Maggie Rembert, about saying something light, and I didn't really know what to say. And she said, ""Papa, you can always tell them about the invisible man who married the invisible woman. The kids weren't much to look at either."" Let me, if I can -- I'm going to stick with -- sorry. Let me just start with -- I'm going to let Phil's facts speak for themselves. And I agree with them whole-heartedly on the road to prosperity. I want to just say -- and again I want to agree with Laura that it's not partisan. It's not Republican. It's not Democrat. It's not liberal. It's not conservative. It's not left wing, it's not right wing. It's economics. And that's where we really are. And it's really not partisan ideology. It's plain business. And if you look at today's economy -- and I do want to look at today's economy -- when you look at what the government has done and is doing, I think they truly are stifling the American spirit today. It reminds me very much of what happened in the 1930s when you got that, whenever people make decisions -- whenever people make decisions when they're either panicked or drunk the consequences are rarely attractive. We have had a panic decision here in the United States, and I believe it was wrong. I believe the government intervened dramatically when they should not have. They should have had a brown paper bag and gotten the feelings out of them. They should not have moved. But they did. We had TARP. We had the interventions there, the stimulus packages. They don't work. Now, what Laura is correct about is that they sure worked for the beneficiaries of the stimulus programs. That's true. The transfer recipients were stimulated, and they did spend more. No question about it. But the people from whom the resources were taken, they spent less. And as we all know in economics, and if you go to the Slutsky Equations in an economy, the income effects always sum to zero, bingo. While the transfer recipients are stimulated, the transfer payers are de-stimulated, and there is no net stimulus from these packages purely. Now, the substitution effects aggregate. And what has happened is we've led the huge deficits, huge tax rates, and output employment production. I mean, let me just take you through quickly what they did in the Great Depression. I mean, 1929, we passed Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the largest tax on traded products in the world. Then in 1930 it was signed into law, you got the crash in the markets. 1932, under a Republican president, they raised the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S., from 25 percent to 63 percent. Now, wasn't that smart? By the way, I'm not mentioning any of the others, inheritance tax, the gift taxes, you know, all these other taxes, excise, et cetera. 1936, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democrat this time, they raised the highest marginal tax rate from 63 percent to 79 percent and then on up the next year to 81 percent. You wonder why it was the longest deepest depression in U.S. history, that's why. I mean, they raised the estate tax up to 90 percent. I mean, it's amazing what happened there. What you're seeing today in the United States is an exact pattern following that. When interventionist people get going, you can't stop it, and that is precisely what's happening in the U.S. In part it's because of the agency problem, and the agency problem is very simply that the people in government don't bear the consequences of their own actions. They are not compensated for their success or their failures. They're compensated. It's very different than what happens in the private sector. And that's why you get a misbehavior there. Just on the stimulus, let me just try it, if something doesn't work in a two-person economy, it's not good economics. Take two farmers, that's the whole world. If one of those farmers gets unemployment benefits, guess who pays for it? The other farmer. You know, it is -- there is no tooth fairy in government. There is no -- you know, there is no Father Christmas working on the Treasury staff. My colleague, Milton Friedman, was correct when he said, ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch."" If you look at tax rates on the upper income groups, anyone who looks at these data from the statistics of income, these people know how to get around taxes. If you raise their tax rates, they shift their income, they shift the location of their income, they shift the timing of their income, they shift the volume of their income, and they pay less in taxes. The only group that consistently pays less when you raise their tax rates and more when you lower them are the top one percent of income earners. That is literally what happens. Again, just to finish my comments, and I'm going to finish my comments early if I can, John, but I don't want to go way over your head on this, but if you tax people who work and you pay people who don't, do I need to say the next sentence to you? Help me, if you tax rich people, and you give the money to poor people, you're going to get lots and lots of poor people and no rich people. The dream in America has always been to make the poor rich, not to make the rich -- the rich poor. I mean, if I can quote John F. Kennedy here, and I'm a Kennedy Democrat from the '60s, I've worked with Democrats as much or more -- I mean, I started with Phil Gramm, can you believe that? When he was a Democrat. But, you know, Kennedy put it beautifully when he said, ""The best form of welfare is still a good high paying job."" I mean, Benjamin Hooks I thought did it wonderfully when he said that “Blacks are hired last, and they're fired first. The only way we're ever going to get jobs and keep them is there's so darn many jobs around they got to hire us."" I want to tell you very seriously, there is only one solution to the economic problem that we're facing, that's economic growth, and to get that economic growth you've got to realign incentives both in government and in the private sector to make sure that you produce the way you should in this country. And with that I'd like to say thank you to the groups that are putting on this debate. You guys are all wonderful. ",1.0
against,"Good evening, everyone. It's great being here on this NYU stage. I'm a professor at NYU, so great being here at home. Is big government stifling the American spirit? My answer is no. You heard the Gramm and Laffer bashing the government. They’re the two high priests of supply-side economics, what is also referred to as voodoo economics. Actually the term voodoo economics was first used by George Bush when he was campaigning against Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign. It’s a religionbecause it’s based not on facts or science but on faith. They have ten commandments. Big government and most government spending are always wasteful and stifles the American spirit, first. Second, free markets always know best, they never fail, they never experience a national crisis. Three, it’s best to have no regulation or supervision of markets, especially financial markets. Four, high taxes are bad especially for the rich and the very rich. Five, lowering tax rates increases revenues overall, the Laffer Curve doesn’t work. Even if lower taxes lead to higher deficits, higher deficits don’t matter. Seven, even if lower tax rates cause higher deficits, that’s good because you’ve got to starve the beast, you’ve got to force the government to cut back its own size. That doesn’t work either. Eight, government spending is always wasteful unless it’s for foreign wars that cost trillions of dollars. Nine, subsidies are bad but subsidies and tax breaks for big business are always good even if they bust the budget. Ten, income and wealth inequality are good; as Gordon Gekko said, greed is good. In capitalism it is the survival of the fittest or the richest. Big government should have nothing to do with income inequality. Now these are the principles, but with a bunch of experiments in the ’80s and the last ten years which means 2001 to 2008 during the Bush administration -- we had the system of free markets and laissez-faire economics, no regulation, supervision of the financial system, lower tax rates and supply-side voodoo economics and a rhetoric of bashing big government while increasingly spending on government spending, discretionary spending and on the military. What did we end up with? We ended up with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, two expensive foreign wars financed with two trillion dollars worth of debt, with budget deficits that were already over a trillion dollars when Obama became president. So who bailed out Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, AIG, Citi, Goldman-Sachs, an entire financial system with 700 billion TARP money? Was it the Democrats? No, it was during the Bush administration. So who are the culprits of this economic, fiscal, and financial mess? Is it big government?  The culprits are here, by the way, two of them are here, Mr. Laffer, Mr. Gramm. And I mean it literally. Paul Krugman listed Mr. Gramm as the number two person responsible for the economic crisis after Alan Greenspan. If you believe that Krugman is biased, both CNN and Time Magazine put them in the list of the top 20 people to blame for the financial crisis. What his record is is he has been bashing big government forever, for decades, but he was a leading author by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that essentially repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, that led to what is called the CitiGroup Relief Act, that led to the merger, the disastrous merger, of CitiCorp and the Travelers group. Now they’re under government control, these financial institutions. And as we know, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was one of the many causes of the recent financial crisis. Gramm was also one of the five co-sponsors of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 that essentially limited any regulation of credit derivatives and other derivatives, with even an Enron loop hole in it that essentially limited any regulation of energy futures. You know what ended up happening with Enron. It went to a scandal and bankruptcy. Other parts of this act limited regulation and supervision of credit derivatives, of CDSs and other derivatives as well at the center of this financial crisis. Warren Buffet calls these derivatives weapons of mass destruction. So that’s the record. Does he think he’s responsible for some of the financial crisis? Not only doesn’t he, but in a July 2008 interview, when he was advisor to McCain, he said that the nation was not even in a recession. He said, you’ve heard of mental depression. This is a mental recession. We’ve sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear the constant whining, complaining about the loss of competitiveness, American decline. During this mental recession, 8.5 million people lost their jobs, unemployment went to 10 percent, 17 percent including discouraged workers or partially-employed workers. And of course Mr. Gramm and Mr. Laffer believe that giving unemployment benefits because of loss of jobs and income is bad because it reduces the incentive to find new work. Now what’s the record instead of Mr. Laffer? He is the father of the Laffer Curve, the idea that if you lower tax rates, revenue is eventually going to be become higher. Now, there is zero, zero evidence that tax rates pay for themselves. I could cite hundreds of economic studies, but I will cite just one person, Greg Mankiw, who was the main economic advisor of George Bush, W. He is also a professor at Harvard. He said the following thing about the idea of a Laffer Curve working, in a part of his textbook called Charlatans and Cranks. “When politicians rely on the advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the desirable results they anticipate. After Reagan's election, Congress passed the cut in tax rates that Reagan advocated. But the tax cut did not cause tax revenue to rise.” And I could cite hundreds of other studies suggesting that there is absolutely no evidence that reducing tax rates increases revenues. David Stockman, who was the budget director for Reagan, most recently in an op-ed in the New York Times titled “How My Republican Party Destroyed the American Economy.” And he started his op-ed by saying, “If there was such a thing as a chapter 11 for politicians, the Republican push to extend unaffordable Bush tax cuts would amount to bankruptcy filing. That's the lesson.” Now, we realize that tax cuts do not reduce budget deficits. They increase them sharply. So they change the argument in favor of tax cuts. They realize that tax cuts are to budget deficit. But they say, first of all, it doesn't matter. Or if does matter, it's going to starve the beast. To have low tax rates is going to force the government to cut government spending. That was the argument. The result was just the opposite. When Bush came to power in 2001, discretionary spending was 260 billion at that time. By the time he left the administration eight years later, it was 420 billion, twice as much.  Could I make a final point?",1.0
for,"When you can't debate issues, you attack people personally.  Let's -- First of all, my confidence in freedom is not based on faith. It's based on evidence. Two, it's true that Bill Clinton spent the whole campaign attacking me and attacking Gramm-Leach-Bliley. But when he became president, and he proposed reforming the banking system, how many changes do you think he made in Gramm-Leach-Bliley?  In fact, he strengthened Gramm-Leach-Bliley to require systemically significant companies to become financial services holding companies under Gramm-Leach-Bliley. So the plain truth is Gramm-Leach-Bliley broad based organizations did better during the financial crisis. There would have been more failures without the law. Obama had a chance to change the law, and he didn't do it. Now, some people would say, well, maybe he wasn't telling the truth to begin with.  I think he just learned something. Not everybody did.",1.0
against,"Well, I'm not sure I would agree it is the core of their argument, because I want to say that I think the issue that we need to discuss more is that as a country, we actually, as I said, want the government to spend money. But then we don't want to pay for it. And one of the words that was only used here once tonight, but needs to be brought back, is the word entitlement. And I think it's important to point out right now that according to the CBO, within 15 years entitlements plus net interest will absorb all of the tax revenues of the US government. We could not do anything else, no education, no technology, no infrastructure, no other government whatsoever. So I think that as we debate what kind of tax system we're going to have, and I think that's a legitimate area of debate, we also have to address the fact that 78 percent of Americans will say growing costs of entitlements pose a major problem for the United States. But if you ask them what to do about it, 56 percent say no tax increases to solve the problem. 66 percent say no benefit cuts to solve the problem. A third of the people say no change whatsoever to solve the problem, a big problem, but not my problem. And I do think we have to ask ourselves the question of if we want to spend on programs, how are we going to finance them? But I think -- I'm happy to answer that question -- but I honestly think it's -- Yes, go ahead. There is absolutely no evidence that increasing tax rates when they're at normal levels is going to reduce labor efforts. When Clinton came to power, he raised the marginal tax rate from 35 to 39 percent. Everybody, including these gentlemen, said it's going to be a disaster, a recession.  We had eight years of the highest economic growth in the U.S. economy, and no effect on the tax burden of anybody. And then -- and then, when Bush came to power, he reduced these taxes. We lost $2 trillion of revenues. We had a huge budget deficit. We eventually ended up with the worst financial crisis and economic recession since The Great Depression. So where is the evidence?",2.0
for," I'll try to get to the evidence. Let's take Bill Clinton. And Laura, I think you did a great job with Bill Clinton. And I voted for Bill Clinton twice, and God knows I didn't vote in that party's primary. So I voted for him twice, and I thought he was a great president. Little bit of a problem as a person. But he was a great president. But he pushed NAFTA through Congress against his own party, against the unions. I thought that was just wonderful. I took my hat off to him there. As some of you know, he got rid of the retirement test on Social Security. If you were between the ages of 65 and 72, every dollar you earned in Social Security -- is earned, you lost 50 cents in Social Security benefits. Clinton got rid of that. If you look at it, Clinton reappointed Reagan's Fed chairman twice, brought the long-term bond yield way,way down. I thought that was spectacular. If you look at what Clinton did, he passed welfare reform, signed into law welfare reform, that you actually have to look for a job to get welfare. Now, there's a concept. Clinton also had the biggest capital gains tax cut in our nation's history. If you know, he exempted -- got rid of all capital gains taxes on owner-occupied homes, couples and -- I mean virtually all. If you look at Clinton, the one thing I really like most of all about Bill Clinton is he cut government spending as a share of GDP by the largest amount of any American president ever. In fact, it was he cut it by four times -- by as much as the next four best presidents combined. There is a supply side president, in my view. Yes, he did raise tax rates on the -- .

And if you ask people, and I've already said this, ""Are you willing to cut benefits or raise taxes to bring this cost situation under control?"" the answer is no. So one of the things we actually have to do as public figures is to educate people. I think that Phil Gramm has put out some interesting ideas; I think that those are ideas which a lot of people would disagree with. I think that -- but nonetheless, those are the kinds of things we have to discuss, not some sort of fantasy about size of government, forget it -- about the particulars of the big programs that are driving the government debt. And on the issue of -- just on the issue of making Social Security solvent, the 75-year actuarial hole is basically the same size as the Bush tax cuts. So there's a nice choice for people, all right? And remember, as Nouriel said, going back to the Clinton level tax rates would go back to levels of rates that coincided with the most prosperous peacetime period in U.S. economic history. So those are not tax rates that are going to stifle the American spirit. It is a way to pay for the actuarial shortfall of Social Security. You might not want to do it that way, but at least recognize, that's a choice.",2.0
for,"Yeah, first I'd like to ask Nouriel not to quote me when it's incorrect. I never thought the Clinton tax increases would lead to a recession, depression. Never wrote it, never said it. I was a huge fan of Bill Clinton’s overall economic package. I didn’t think those rates were the right things to do but I didn’t. And I would agree with Laura. I mean, come on. Let’s go back to the Clinton era. If you could bring government spending down to theshare of GDP to where it was under Clinton, I think I’d take that along with the other ones going there. I’d love to see freer trade. I mean you really can’t have a prosperous economy, people. You can’t when the government’s way overspending, when it’s raising tax rates, when it’s printing too much money, when it’s over-regulating the private sector and when it’s restricting the free-flow of goods and services. Of course. Let me go first with this. When we talk -- you know, the question you asked Laura which I think is the right question about taxes. I mean, what I’d do is what Jerry Brown did about taxes when he ran for president in 1992. I’d get rid of all federal taxes except for sin taxes, and have two flat-rate taxes, one on business net sales and one on personal and adjusted gross income. If you did that, you could have Jerry Brown flat tax of 13 percent. Now if I remember correctly Jerry was not a right-wing Republican. Did I miss that somewhere?",2.0

Then you get the growth or you will get the revenue gains, Nouriel. Frankly, you really will get them. Well then you go to the spending side and I would put it on a balanced budget and vote for if you’re going to have more spending, you’ve got to vote to debit tax rates, go step in step. You can’t do it separately. And if people want more taxes and more government, once you get an efficient system, god bless them, it’s their country. But my view is I’d rather see it go the other way. I think the other way would be better but it’s their country and they deserve it. I mean, people deserve the governments they get and that’s for sure. But it isn’t just let it go at all times and Nouriel, I thought, in the debate at least when you were introduced, was that you won the debate last time you were here, Nouriel, by saying it was Washington’s fault, not Wall Street’s fault.",2.0
against,"First of all it wasn’t Wall Street’s fault as much as government. The point is that we have a huge budget deficit that everybody knows is unsustainable. It’s trillion dollars. But the question is how did we get here, and by the time Obama came to power, the deficit was already a trillion dollars. First of all, it happened because we had totally unsustainable tax cuts in 2001, 2003. Two, we had these laissez-faire policies that led to the worst economic and financial crisis and we had to bail out the banks. The collapse of income led to the collapse of revenues. And that’s the situation we started from. Now we have a budget deficit that’s 10 percent of GDP. Do we really think that we are going to be able to reduce spending by 10 percent of GDP? Everybody agrees we need entitlement spending reform. We have to restructure social security, Medicare. We have to cut entitlement spending. But how are you going to fix this gap? How are you going to go to a zero budget balance? When Bush left the administration, the tax rate in the United States as a share of GDP, revenues of the federal government were 15 percent, the lowest in the last 60 years. The average has been 20 percent because of his reckless tax cuts. So we need to reduce the budget deficit. We have to cut spending, but we also have to raise gradually over time revenues. There’s not going to be any way in which the American people are going to decide to slash Social Security, to slash Medicare, to slash military spending and not to have any revenue increase. So we have to find way in the middle, but you guys are always on the side of lower taxes that every time they’re implemented during the Reagan years, was in the Bush years, led to bigger budget deficits and lead to economic and financial disasters.",2.0
for,"Well, first of all, I don’t defend spending under George Bush. Neither do I. I thought we had an unnecessary deficit. I thought we let spending get out of control, especially after the House became Democrat and you had Pelosi as Speaker. No, it’s just a plain fact. In seeking consensus, George W. Bush spent money. We should have forced the defense build up as we fought wars to be offset against weapons procurement. But the plain truth is Obama has proposed to expand or to extend the Bush tax cut except for $30 billion. Nobody is proposing to take that tax cut back. And look, let me tell you, having looked a long time at Social Security and Medicare, you can't deal with these problems by raising taxes. You have got to be willing to change these systems and make them more actuarially balanced. When people started getting Social Security, the average American didn't live to be 65. The world is changed. The system didn't chan67ge. There was never a trust fund. It's a financial Ponzi scheme of the worst sort.Laura Tyson: It was -- We've got to go back and fix these things. And doing polls, Americans will always say they don't want to fight a battle intellectually as long as it's a choice. But when you give them effective leadership, they're willing to fight those battles. And what both parties need to do is give people a way of solving the problem instead of just simply saying, well, the people don't want to solve the problem.",2.0
against,"My response would be that I do agree that we need to give the American people a choice. But I do want to say the American people, through poll after poll, are not willing to do basic arithmetic. This is not a size of government problem. It's an arithmetic problem. If we never had the great financial crisis of 2008 and ’9, we didn't have it at all, we would still face unsustainable deficits and debt driven by our programs that are the most popular programs with Americans. We haven't talked about healthcare reform tonight. I try sometimes to link what we're talking about to the experience of other countries. I mentioned that we have a relatively small government by other countries' standards, that are very, very competitive growing economies with satisfied people who have suffered less from the great recession. Most of these countries have very different healthcare systems than we do. And let's be clear about this. Medicare itself as an entitlement problem is because of healthcare cost growth. But it's not because Medicare grows faster than private healthcare. It's because we have a private healthcare cost problem in this country. We spend three times as much as any other country on a per capita basis on health. Our healthcare costs grow most rapidly. And we do not have better quality. We do not have better outcomes. We do not have more choice. Americans don't want to hear this, but they need to hear it because you cannot solve the deficit and debt problem, which would exist independent of the crisis, as I said, if we don't -- if we're not serious about healthcare reform. And you knowhow this was discussed by the critics of big government in the debate about healthcare reform? Controlling costs was described as death panels, death panels. That's how you take a serious issue and you make it an ideological debate, which precludes making tough choices.",2.0
for," Any time is a good time to be young. I think the link between marginal tax rates and the exertion of human energy is one of the best documented links of any economic observation in history. Secondly, we do need to create more jobs. And that's what this debate is really about, even though, quite frankly, Ididn't realize till you said it, that we hadn't been talking about it. And what does your future depend on? Does it depend on government getting bigger? Does it depend on half of all income taxes going just to service the debt on government? Or does it depend on more opportunity and more freedom, where ordinary people are empowered to do extraordinary things? America is not a great and powerful country because the most brilliant people in the world came to live here. It's a great and powerful country because ordinary people like us have been able to do extraordinary things with our freedom. And that's what I believe is in peril. That's why these numbers scare me.",2.0
against," Let me say a little bit about that because I think we can also relate it to jobs. Imean, I think -- when I think about the American spirit, and I think about the current situation, I do worry most about young people. We haven't -- we've talked about the government tonight. We haven't talked about state government. State governments do have balanced budgets. One of the reasons that you don't feel so much of the federal stimulus effect is because states have had to contract a lot. And do you know where they contract? They contract in education. That's where they have to contract. So if you think of the American spirit as art programs, if you think of it as music programs, if you think of it as athletic programs, if you think of it as foreign language programs, if you think of it as your child going to school in a safe building structure that's energy efficient, all of those things are being stifled, because the state revenues have collapsed because we are in a major recession. And the major recession was caused by a major financial shock. And frankly, again, there is no easy way out of this. And I for one think because the federal government can afford to borrow at very attractive very low interest rates near record low interest rates, we should be helping those who are unemployed get training, we should be helping teachers stay in school, we should be providing aid so that every single kid who wants to go to college right now can afford to go to college. What better time to go to college than right now? So those are the ways in which I think the debt we inherited, the concern about deficits, the unwillingness to let the government help as it does -- as it's helped throughout history in this kind of crisis, to help ordinary Americans achieve their spirit, that this is a real problem. I think the American spirit has been -- the confidence in the U.S. has been shaken by the depth of the crisis we are in, and I think the way we are forcing cuts on basic services like education is certainly stifling the spirit and perhaps the life prospects of kids who are five, six, seven years old. Remember, we have 25 percent now -- almost 25 percent of children in poverty in the United States.",2.0
for,"Well, let me first say I agree with you, you asked about how many people had it, theanswer is ""not enough."" To me the American spirit is a belief that based on your own merit, based on your own hard work, no matter who your daddy was or who he wasn't, or who your mama was, that people are going to judge you on your ability, and that you have it within your power to succeed. Now, obviously it's better to be -- -- it's better to be clever, and pretty, and rich. But being plain, and ordinary, and poor, those things are not insurmountable obstacles in America. And it's that belief of what we can do, but you can't have unlimited government and unlimited opportunity. You have to make a choice. Art and I aren't against government, but we believe that it has got to be limited if we're going to have that kind of opportunity. And Americans are optimistic people because of who we are and what our history has been. We can't have France's government and be Americans.",2.0
against," You know, when I was last here I argued that both the government and the private sector was to be blamed for the crisis and it was a crisis caused by many policy mistakes by those who -- by reckless risk taking, leverage, and debt of the private sector -- so it's always a complicated story. But if the American spirit is stifled today, it is because this is not a mental recession, this is a real recession, this is the worst recession we have had since the Great Depression with unemployment rate now at 17 percent. We have nine million people out of work that have lost their jobs, and unless we address this problem, we're not going to resolve this mental, and physical, and economic, and financial depression. Now, what can we do about jobs? The CBO, Congressional Budget Office, did a study that suggested that of all the types of stimulus, the one that has the least effect on economic growth and job creation is reducing taxes for the rich. And the one that has the strongest effect on raising the demand for labor is to reduce the payroll tax both for employers and employees. And I proposed in an article recently a reduction temporarily in the payroll tax for employers and employees to be paid by the expiration of the tax cuts for the rich. They are expiring at the end of the year, so it’s not a budget busting reduction in taxes, it’s revenue neutral. We’re not going to increase the budget deficit that’s already one trillion and a half and stimulate economic growth. We have to stop subsidizing the rich. We have to start stimulating demand for labor for workers. That’s what we need to do.",2.0
for,"Let me just carry Nouriel’s comments a little further and I do agree with him on that. Is when you look at a firm’s decision to hire a worker, that firm that makes its decision based upon the gross wages paid to the worker. The marginal product they have to get out of that worker has to cover the gross wages paid, inclusive of all costs. When youlook at a worker’s decision to work, they look at net wages received. They couldn’t care less how much the firm pays. They care how much they get net. And there’s a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received, one on the demand curve and one on the supply curve of labor. What you’ve got to do is reduce that wedge to make it more attractive for firms to hire workers and more attractive for workers to work. One way of doing that is Nouriel’s comment here to lower the payroll taxes. That would work very well. Where I do disagree with him totally is on raising tax rates on the rich who are the people who do the employment. Let me tell you, these guys don’t employ workers for altruistic reasons. They employ the workers to get an after-tax profit of their own. And if you make it discouraging for them to employ workers, they’re not going to employ them. These people are the decision makers and that’s what you’ve really got to worry about. It’s not an equity argument of whether the rich can afford it or not. It’s whether they’ll disemploy people or not. Just look at their behavior. That’s what you’ve got to do. But he’s right. It’s the wedge between the wages paid and wages received and that is the key to bringing employment back. Everything we’re not doing today.",2.0
against,"Can I ask Art a question that actually combines something? So Nouriel is suggesting, and it’s something I also support, thinking about bringing the top two Bush tax cuts for the top two percent down back to the Clinton era and using the money which is 30 to 40 billion dollars next year either for a payroll tax deduction or for more aid to the states or for a number of other things. Now you suggested that, Art, that you were concerned about raising taxes on the rich. This would basically be bringing them back to the Clinton level, which you thought was fine. It actually worked really well.",2.0

against,"So we need the revenue -- no but that was a key part of his program. Give me -- that was the first -- as Nouriel has already said, that was the first thing that he did. The reason that the Democrats lost control of the Congress in 1994 is because the Republicans claimed that the Democrats were responsible for the largest middle class tax increase in history. Do you know what that was? A four and a half cent gasoline tax, okay? So I say you think those taxes of the Clinton administration were fine, let’s go back to them, take the money which is 40 billion dollars next year and my goodness we could find several ways, the CBO listed about 10 different ways of using that money to create more jobs.",2.0

Do we want to pay it?  The problem is they’ll go to work for somebody else. That's what's called competition. And when we start setting our value judgment as the standard by which we're going to gauge value, we start making a mistake.

As our dear colleague argued when he was last here, this was a crisis made in Washington. I also think it's important to note -- and I'm not here to defend a bank bailout.

You know, frankly, it was not for tears for Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns or any of the banks that received federal money. It was because credit markets had closed down. It is because money market funds were about to go under. Itwas because things that you relied upon as you put your money in the money market, and it was worth -- put in $500, when you went, there was $500. There wasn't going to be $500. So this was a bailout of the financial system. There was a run on the financial system. Capitalist economies cannot run without finance. There was no solution -- I'm saying the government had to act. It had to get bigger. We can debate the cause, but we may as well deal with the reality. That was the reality. Can I -- can I say that I thought --",2.0

We have dramatically increased spending in education, and quality has fallen because we let education be dominated by a monopoly, the teacher's union. So we need to make some dramatic reforms. But look, here is the problem, and I agree with Laura, we do have a special circumstance. We have a crisis. But when you're looking at the debt burden that we're piling up now, that's not going to go away when the crisis goes away, the problem with saying let's do this later -- Through government. Well, first of all, I think the best investment government can make is to put its financial house in order so that we can have a functioning private system so that we can have more private investment and more job creation. So the first thing I'd invest in is deficit reduction. The second thing that I would invest in is science. Science -- basic science, not taking an idea and commercializing it, something government knows absolutely nothing about, and where every day somewhere in the world we see some huge program where the Japanese invested in high definition television, invested huge amounts of money, and it ended up the market went the other direction, it was all lost. So basic science, basic knowledge, basic ability to do things -- not just to cure people quicker and better, but to do it cheaper. We have virtually no investment in healthcare ineconomy. If I bought groceries the way I buy healthcare, where somebody else pays 95 cents out of every dollar, I'd eat different, and so would my dog. And that -- That's the problem in healthcare.",2.0
against,"I just feel like I need to repeat, and maybe I have indeed failed as a debater -- My comment in my opening statement was precisely that. I identified exactly where I thought the government should invest. The government used to spend much more on basic science and research. It used to spend much more on infrastructure. Those are areas. And it used -- and it must spend much more on higher education. This is not -- federal government doesn't spend much on K through 12. Higher education. So I look at the research. 90 percent of the growth in labor productivity, which is the driving force of how productive the nation is and what we can afford to pay ourselves, 90 percent comes from investments in those three areas, higher education, research and science, and infrastructure, and the U.S. government used to spend 69 percent of its budget on it, and now it only spends 32 percent. And what is squeezing that out? What's squeezing that out is entitlements and interest on the debt, because we are unwilling to pay for the things we need to pay for. So that's the tradeoff, yes, the U.S. government is not investing enough in your future, in our future. But it's very clear where it should be making those investments. I just need a clarification. The one trillion dollars -- are you referring to healthcare reform? Okay, so what we know about this is that again the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has basically determined that that package if put in place will actually reduce the deficit. It will reduce the deficit. Now -- -- all right. The reason you don't -- No. The reason you don't believe that if you're laughing -- the reason you don't believe that if you're laughing is because you don't believe that healthcare costs in the United States in the private sector are going to slow down, because the only way, the only way we can get control over the federal government's healthcare spending, which is now more than half of all healthcare spending in the United States, is if private healthcare costs slow down. Remember, we're spending three times as much as any other advanced industrial country. There are lots of other models out there. They're not all socialized medicine. We are doing a lousy job in the healthcare sector. So I think that the one trillion dollars has basically been credited as something that will pay for itself if we get healthcare costs down.

I was always amazed when I was in government at all of the empathy that went to people who were riding in the wagon that were benefiting from government, but no empathy for people that were pulling the wagon. On welfare you can get $17,500 of benefits per child, and under the federal tax code, if you work for a living, you get $1,000 tax credit per child.

That the share of income going to the top one percent the top 0.01 percent is larger than it’s ever been in our country and we need to just think about that. Now that goes to the issue and I ended a comment I made before about we need to also think about the fact that now about a quarter of our children live in poverty. This is about the kind of society one wants. It’s not actually about freedom or lack of freedom. It’s about what kind of society one wants.

Right now the government has been forced to do more than it normally does because of the crisis. I believe the government will get smaller once the crisis -- we’ve gotten through the crisis but I think it’s important to do that. I think it is important for the government to invest in our future and I’ve made that clear how the government should do that. I’ve noted that we haven’t talked at all tonight about, amazingly enough, defense.  If we really want to make the U.S. government smaller, do we really want to spend 20 percent of the government’s budget on defense and 43 percent of the world’s spending on weapons? Do we really want -- do we think that’s fair? And finally I would say that I do think that we need to, as a society, ask ourselves the question about what kinds of benefits we want, what are we willing to pay for. Because what has happened in the starving the beast mentality is we actually have made the tax base smaller. We don’t tax even at the levels of the Clinton administration, but we’ve made the government bigger. You know, notonly did we fight two wars without financing them under President George W. Bush, but we also passed the Medicare prescription drug benefit program. That was more than a trillion dollars. No funding.  The CBO said that would cost a trillion dollars with no funding. The CBO in the trillion-dollar bill that was just passed said it paid for itself. So where was the big entitlement with no funding? It came under George W. Bush. My point is if we want that kind of benefit, we’d better be serious about how to pay for it because right now, our government is not that big. It’s not that big. of GDP but we’re funding it -- help from the rest of the world. ",3.0

We’ve got to explain to America what is at stake. And I don’t want to dwell on the past. I was asked about the past versus the future but the past is the only thing we know about the future. When Ronald Reagan became president, people sensed that we had a crisis. We had wasted ten years of economic growth with stagnation, double digit inflation, high unemployment. And we had to make hard decisions. America made those decisions because they believed there was a crisis. I believe there's a crisis today. And more importantly, I believe that Americans believe it. But what they're waiting on is leadership to show them the alternative. It's just like at the end with the medical analogy, you get sick, you go to the doctor. The options he gives you are often not very palatable, especially if you're very sick. But you do it because you believe that you will get better if you do those things.

Because we tried twice in the ’80s and again in the last decade an experiment in voodoo economics.

Should we be in Iraq? Should we be in Afghanistan? That's a big government intervention, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Should we socialize all the -- no, but I -- hold that. Should we socialize all the losses for these companies? Absolutely not. But you can't have a profit and loss system without losses. For people who overborrowed on their income, for banks that were undercapitalized, if they made a play, and it's wrong, let them lose. Just let it go and let the system work and go. Government is way too big. Should we invest in a flat rate tax where the government's not meddling in every single person? Yes, we should. We should do all of that. Government is way too big, and it is stifling the American spirit as these two and the two of us all agree. If I can -- You know, I think Phil Gramm, a little story is the correct story. I think his facts are great, but I think you can't have more people sitting in the wagon than you have pulling it. I used to tell my students that if I ran this class like your government runs your country, what I'd do is I'd flunk all the A students out, and I'd give all the F students scholarships. So before you laugh, think about it for a second before you laugh. My A students are a little bit smarter than my F students. So once I changed the rules, my A students are ableto get lower grades than my F students because they don't randomly make the mistake of ever guessing a correct answer. The distribution of grades is unchanged, period. There's not one change. But what have I done? I've destroyed the entire quality of the educational process. You cannot change the distribution of income with taxes. But you can change the volume. Government is too big, and it's stifling the American spirit, as we all agree up here. ",3.0
