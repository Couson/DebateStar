for," It's a great honor to be able to share a table with a man I've admired all my life, in support of a man who I've come to admire tremendously over the last eight months. On June 7th of last year, following the publication of the first NSA stories in the Washington Post and the Guardian, but before Edward Snowden had revealed his identity to us, President Obama addressed the revelations. And he said, ""I welcome this debate, and I think it is healthy for our democracy."" The president was right. This debate has been healthy for our democracy and for democracies around the world. In fact, it's the extraordinary global debate that Edward Snowden launched -- a debate about the threat that mass surveillance poses to free societies, about how surveillance technologies have outpaced democratic controls, about whether the Internet will be an instrument of democratic liberation or authoritarian control -- that provides the best answer to tonight's debate. Edward Snowden is justified because he provided to journalists and through them to us information that we had a right to know and that we had a need to know. The government had not just concealed this information, it had lied to us about it. And the debate that we've had and that we're still having would not have happened any other way. Now, in those same June 7th remarks, President Obama also defended the government's surveillance practices. He said that those practices had been blessed and approved by all three branches of government: within the executive branch, by the courts, and by the Congress. Now, in making that point, President Obama probably would have said that he was joining our opponents' table. I would respectfully submit that exactly the opposite is true. And why do I say that? I say it because the same oversight bodies that had blessed these activities in the dark have dramatically challenged them and changed course in the light. Now, all three branches of government are engaged in a historicreevaluation of the NSA's surveillance practices. And we're virtually certain to see the first new limits on intelligence surveillance since the 1970s. What a difference an informed public can make. In short, our traditional democratic oversight mechanisms failed miserably before Snowden's revelations. Now, they're doing their jobs. Let's begin with Congress. When the Guardian revealed that the NSA had been -- collected the phone records of every American on a daily basis, many members of Congress expressed shock -- even though that program was purportedly authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Now, there's been a lot of debate since then about whether Congress did or did not know, or what they knew or did not know. But does it really matter? Either way, this was a colossal failure of oversight. Either they knew and did nothing, or they didn't know what the NSA was doing in collecting all the Americans' information on a daily basis. Now, we're all familiar with Congress's most dramatic oversight failure. And this was in the notorious exchange between Senator Ron Wyden and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Wyden had asked, did the NSA collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? Clapper's answer was, ""No, sir."" Now, this brazen falsehood is most often described as Clapper's lie to Congress, but that's not what it was. Wyden knew that Clapper was lying. Only we didn't know. And Congress lacked the courage to correct the record -- allowed us to be deceived by the Director of National Intelligence. To me, that is the very definition of failed oversight. And Edward Snowden was watching. Now, what about our courts? The court that had blessed the NSA's mass surveillance of Americans is a specialized court that meets in secret and hears only from the government. It was designed to grant warrants for foreign intelligence collection. It makes sense that such a court would hear only from the government. Over the last decade, it expanded its role to rule on the legality and constitutionality of programmatic surveillance. Judicial review of those programs amounted to a secret court upholding secret programs by secretly reinterpreting American -- federal laws. Now, when groups like the ACLU tried to challenge the NSA's activities in open federal courts, an interesting thing happened. The government didn't say to those courts that the programs were illegal. The government said that we had no right to be in court. And the courts exceeded to that demand. The government's argument was, we couldn't prove that we had been surveilled. Therefore, we had no standing to even raise these challenges. And in a 5 to 4 decision last year, the Supreme Court accepted that rationale and dismissed the case withouteven considering the legality of these programs. Edward Snowden was watching that too. Now, when critics say that Edward Snowden should have gone through the system, that's the system they're talking about. Courts and a Congress that had abdicated their constitutional oversight role. Now, what's happened since Edward Snowden's act of conscience -- since he brought the public into this discussion? Well, two federal judges have now considered whether the NSA's mass collection of Americans' phone data is legal. One said it's almost certainly unconstitutional, almost Orwellian. Another disagreed, but the key point is that both of these judges heard the challenge. They both agreed that we had standing to challenge the program, which was a remarkable development in itself. Finally, these courts are doing their job and more challenges are on the way. What about Congress? A newly energized Congress has held dozens of oversight hearings -- public ones -- And is considering sweeping intelligence reforms that we haven't seen in nearly half a century -- to end bulk collection of Americans' phone records, to reform that secret FISA court so that it doesn't only hear from the government and others. Even the executive branch has undergone an extraordinary reevaluation of these programs. An NSA review panel appointed by the president -- which included very, very senior former intelligence officials -- the number two at the CIA -- concluded that the NSA had allowed its technological capabilities to dictate its surveillance practices, rather than ensuring that its practices conform to our laws and values. None of this would have happened without Edward Snowden. For that reason alone, he was justified.",nan
against," I was honored to be asked to be here tonight, with this distinguished group. But, to tell you the truth, since I spent 22 years as a Washington lawyer, and then some time out at the CIA in the Clinton administration, I'm actually honored to be invited into any polite company for any purpose at all. I am going to be relying on the blog, the Lawfare blog, which publishes material usually a few days after it's released to press, and much of the Snowden material has come into the public media in that way. A couple of introductory points: Once you release material that had been classified or restricted for any other contractual or any other reason, you release it to the world. Mr. Snowden pledged to protect the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic, but he didn't do that. What he did was release -- steal and release -- material that went to, among others, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, Hamas, Pyongyang, Tehran and so on. In the real world, you can't have a principle that it is really important to release material, but you're only going to release it to nice people; you're not going to let terrorists and dictators peruse it and use it. But that's what they do, and that's what they are doing, because Mr. Snowden decided to let them do that. Also, it is important, I think, that what Mr. Snowden did must be viewed in the context of an overall approach toward dealing with these tremendous issues of privacy versus security. He looked at this question, apparently, from the point of view of one who can pick and choose those portions of an obligation that he wants to maintain. He did not stay with the proposition that he had to fulfill his obligation to the United States across the board. He ignored some duties and did not ignore others. But he did not fulfill his obligations overall. What are the consequences of this? I'm going to mention five cases that have come to light from Snowden materials and printed in the blogs, about what the consequences are of dealing with international relations in this way, and forcing your country to do it by the leaks that you have sponsored or undertaken. For example, China is the bad boy of cyber attacks. Throughout the world, Chinese cyber attacks -- theft of information and material, malware, on and on -- are a nuisance at best and a potential tragedy at worst to a huge range of countries and individuals. We had figured out a way, pre-Snowden -- the United States government had -- to essentially have a bit of a jiu-jitsu operation against the Chinese and to create a possibility whereby we could take their malware in a cyber world and send it back tothem after make some adjustments and create problems for them rather than they creating problems for us. It's a clever operation. Mr. Snowden, of course, ended it by explicitly turning loose material that dealt with it precisely. We have an organization in the Middle East -- the Islamic State of Iraq -- a terrorist organization of the worst kind. Pre-Snowden, we were reading not only their emails, but their preparation, their early-stage drafts of emails. Had we been reading fully the emails of al-Qaeda before 9/11, we might well have saved thousands of lives. But here, our ability to read ISI's emails has been now obliterated by having been made public to the terrorist group itself. In the defense department, working together with the intelligence community, it has come to be possible to utilize cell phones, and their operation, with some very clever software in such a way that you can help an individual member of the military or an individual CIA operations officer know whether he or she is being followed or not. A very clever system, one that saves people's lives. That also is no longer with us because Snowden betrayed it, and it's now known to our adversaries. In Latin America, we have come to find how to penetrate the communication networks of some of the worst organizations and groups that are selling women, principally women, into sexual slavery. We had a very good handle on how that was being done, working with other Latin American countries in dealing with it. And that trafficking, that human trafficking network and our knowledge of their capabilities is, of course, now gone, with Snowden having released that to those who are enslaving women in that part of the world. ",1.0
for," Yes, I believe that Edward Snowden was fully justified in what he did. That does not cause me to support or make a judgment on any particular thing which has not yet been released or which has been released, exactly, but a question of whether he has served the public interest, on balance, in a way that could not have happened otherwise. I don't know the details that Ambassador, former DCI, James Woolsey, has told about. And I'm not sure how you know, actually, unless you are privy in a way that has not been announced here. I do know what has been released by the papers so far. Snowden, of course, has not released a single page by himself. He has explicitly said, over and over, that his own -- he doesn't trust his own bias in terms of transparency here. He wanted a judgment to be made of public interest by journalists that he trusted, and I think with right. And that is what has come out so far. I think that he was justified to the same degree, and in the same way, that I believe I was justified in releasing 4,000 or 7,000 pages of top secret documents 40 years ago, the Pentagon Papers. I believe that I had been mistaken earlier to keep silent about what I knew to be lies by my president, Lyndon Johnson, and later the president Richard Nixon, for whom I'd also worked, about what they were doing, what was happening, what the costs were, what the prospects were in Vietnam. I was concerned at that moment not so much about the Constitution, which had clearly been violated in terms of lying us into that war, but I was concerned at the people who were dying on both sides wrongly, I thought, by our escalations and by those lies. I'm saying that Snowden, I believe, did what needed to be done, what the public needed to know. I think there was no other way -- no better way and almost no other way -- for that information to get out; that it was worth, as he said, taking the utmost risks to his freedom and even his life. And, of course, we've heard exaltations, actually, by Mike Rogers of the House Intelligence Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, that he should be extralegally assassinated. Others have suggested by due process of law -- I give Ambassador Woolsey credit for talking about the need for due process here. But the fact is had I believed the motives that were described by the people, you know, at the beginning of the supposed opposition to Snowden, and we haven't heard that precisely from these two people yet, but -- or at all -- but if I'd believed that he had done this for some other country, for Russia, for China, to their benefit and -- or even to major benefit to them, outweighing any benefit to the public interest -- I would not be supporting him now. I believe firmly that Edward Snowden is no more a traitor than I am or that I was.  I was called that by the president and the vice president at the time, 40 years ago -- 43 years ago. Many -- I was called every name that has been called, virtually, to Edward Snowden or for that matter to Chelsea Manning earlier. In terms of blood on hands, as to what would be the benefit -- the cost of this, none of that came out in my case, which is, I think, why I'm seen somewhat differently now, 40 years later. Nothing in Chelsea Manning's trial actually came out to justify the statement that people had died as a result of his revelations, and I think you should take with more than a grain of salt the descriptions right now that much worse will happen from Edward Snowden, revelations. The fact is that, I think, what he revealed was not just what NSA was doing, which I will make a premise -- I will stipulate -- was essentially with the knowledge of the president, at the orders of the president, desire of the president, and the knowledge of key figures in Congress. But, as Ben Wizner made the point, that to me reveals his greatest revelation, which is that the reforms that came in after earlier revelations of abuses by the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Army Intelligence, 40 years ago and 35 years ago, that led to the Church Committee and the current reforms, like the FISA Court and the intelligence committees, I think what Snowden has revealed is that those reforms, which were very necessary, failed. And they need to be not only redone, but better reforms are necessary, and I hope very much will result from what Snowden has revealed. As a matter of fact, I'll have mentioned already that Ambassador Woolsey has said that he thought there should be due process, there should be a trial for treason -- that's something I'd argue with -- which implies that he thinks that Snowden adhered to an enemy of the United States -- that's the definition in the Constitution, which I know he knows. I certainly disagree with him on that, and I think there's -- that's absolutely wrong. But he believes then as a result he should get the maximum penalty for that, which is to be hanged by the neck till he is dead. Now, actually one American was hanged by the neck for giving secrets to Americans. Actually, he was the first American to be charged with giving secrets to Americans. I was the second, 200 years later. His name was Nathan Hale, and it was a name that used to be known to every American school child as I know, and I've found sadly that, that's not -- seems not to be the case today. And he was an American spy for George Washington during the American Revolution, hanged by the British, and the reason he was remembered during my growing up was for his words on the gallows: ""I regret that I have but one life to give for my country."" What country was that? Not the country of his birth, that was the colony of King George III, in which he was in rebellion, and was charged with treason essentially, of which he was essentially guilty to George III, like every other signer of the Declaration of Independence, five of whom, out of 56, were hanged as a result. But they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, like Nathan Hale, to a country that did not yet exist in the world, a country of -- later to be, shortly to be -- of a constitution with separation of powers, independent branches with checks and balances against each other, and a country with a Bill of Rights. When Snowden said there were things worth dying for, I agree with him. That's the mood in which I gave the Pentagon Papers, and I think he was right to do what he did to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States.",1.0
against,"Let me jump right in. It's interesting that Mr. Ellsberg should be able to say that he's not able -- or at this point -- to process what's in the documents. What Ambassador Woolsey was referring to was analyses of the actual documents that have been released. If he can't say what's in the documents, that puts him in a common place with EdwardSnowden himself. Notice that Mr. Ellsberg mentioned that he removed, he said, somewhere been four- and seven- thousand documents. And that's what was put out. Snowden has released 1.7 million documents. He couldn't conceivably have known what was in the documents at the time of purloining them and putting them out. We're talking about a massively different leak, and one that's been massively damaging to the United States. John mentioned that this is my second rodeo at Intelligence Squared. I think it's worth revisiting the first one, because it says a lot about the trajectory that we've walked on this road, between liberty and security. When I was here the last time, the question was whether we needed to have more surveillance to prevent terrorist attacks. And -- it was interesting -- the audience was of a mind that, you know, we absolutely did need more surveillance. They recognized we had serious enemies of the United States who wanted to mass murder Americans. But something made them uncomfortable. And when we got to talk to them afterwards, I got to find out what the something was: George Bush. Not George Bush the person, but the concept that so much power was reposed in one individual -- that one person could be able to order warrantless surveillance, that one person could get to be the judge, the jury -- in some instances, as commander-in-chief -- the executioner, on the basis of the information that was gleaned from the warrantless surveillance that was ordered, surveillance that took place without the permission of a court. And that was what the audience back then had the most trouble with, this idea that we don't have enough checks and balances. We don't have enough legislative buy-in. We don't have enough judicial oversight. It's interesting, because what President Bush was trying to impose on this sort of new kind of war was old rules of war. And they were probably best explained in 1948 -- at least the reason for them -- by Robert Jackson, who's an interesting person in American history because he's a giant in both American law and American politics. Nuremberg prosecutor, Supreme Court justice, FDR's attorney general. In a 1948 case, called Chicago and Southern Airlines v. Waterman -- he explained why national security had to be an executive responsibility. And the primary reason was, in a free democracy, the framers thought the most important decisions we make are the decisions about our national security. And they need to be made by elected officials who answer to the people whose lives are at stake. And when you transfer that responsibility over to courts, you take it from the accountable public officials to public officials who are purposely insulated from politics and who you can't get rid of when they get it wrong. Well, we've spent about a half-century now experimenting -- and I think the experiment is still ongoing -- with how far we can afford to depart from the vision of the framers. And from the 1970s forward, what we have tried to do is take rule of law protocols -- which apply to the United States, and mainly the law enforcement system, in peace time -- and impose them on war. And we've had a very difficult time doing it. It's been a blistering debate, at times. And nobody's happy about it. Nobody's ever happy about what the outcome is. Some people think the executive doesn't have enough control anymore. Some think the courts are too involved. Some think the courts are not involved enough. But here's the interesting thing. We did get to a place where we came together as a country -- and even if everybody was not satisfied with the outcome, we did strike a balance. We established laws which took away a lot of the president's unilateral power; forced the president to go to judges in order to get surveillance authority; institutionalized rigorous congressional oversight. In fact, most of what we know about abuses at the NSA actually comes from self-reporting, whether it's self-reporting to courts or self-reporting to Congress. You may not like the laws. I don't like the laws the way that they've -- the way that they’ve finally played out. The NSA program, the metadata program’s a perfect example. There's no question that it's constitutional -- -- the Supreme Court precedent that holds that. Whether it's legal or not under the statute that Congress imposed is a closer question. It turns on what the legal definition of relevance, as applied to this national security question, is. Is it legal, is it not legal? You can make the argument that it's not, but 15 federal judges who've looked at it have upheld it. And nobody has repealed it yet for all the talk about doing that. But here's the thing: We actually set up this system with exactly the checks and balances that were at issue during the Bush days, the bad old Bush days when too much power was reposed in one person. And now where are we with Edward Snowden? We are right back to one person who's judge, jury, lawgiver, one person who decides what American secrets get kept and what gets exposed to our enemies. And that person's not the president anymore. That person is a person who had access to this information because he violated his oath. The last time I was here, the audience told me that could never, ever be justified.",1.0
against,That's two different things. It's not that I'm not concerned. Congress is concerned. That's why there'll probably be some modifications of the law. Was it whistleblower worthy? ,2.0
for,"Well, I've been following this issue very closely, to say the least, over the last ten years or more. I did not know until The Guardian published the document that the NSA, which is a foreign intelligence agency, was, on a daily basis, collecting the phone records of almost every American. Someone else who didn't know, or says he didn't know is Republican representative Jim Sensenbrenner who was one of the principal authors of the Patriot Act, who says that he didn't know until this document was published that section 215 of the Patriot Act was being used in this way. Whether, again, that's true or not isn't important to my argument. Either he did not know -- he certainly should have known. Either way, Congress didn't do anything about it. As soon as the public was read into this debate, we're now seeing open federal courts debate the constitutionality of this. One federal judge actually enjoined it and said it's almost certainly unconstitutional. And we're seeing Congress threaten not to reauthorize this unless the administration will agree to reforms.",2.0
against,"Much of the controversy here involves metadata, which lets the executive branch -- and has for many years -- lets them see and keep a record of what is on the outside of an envelope, let's say, in first class mail, the address, the return address, and the postmark. That's been approved by the courts for a long time. It has been true for decades, it's true now. That is basically metadata with first class mail. If you do it with telephone calls, call number that was called, number that was called from, length of call. What has changed here is not that the federal government has gone away from a reasonable policy. It was, and I think it still is. What's changed is Moore's law. What's changed is now we are talking about emails and telephone calls in the gazillions rather than first class letters. But you still do not hear of substantial malfeasance or other steps using simply the metadata. Where alarms need to be running, they should be discussed, and sometimes it's important. I stood behind at the time and I stand behind Daniel Ellsberg now for his courage in moving on the Pentagon Papers. He was dealing with policy issues and major lies that had come at us from the executive branch, and he did a courageous job, defended himself in court. Federal government misbehaved, and he was released. But what Daniel Ellsberg did I think deserved a whistle blowing. What happens when metadata goes as a result of the development of electronics from one instrumentality to another, even if you knew about it at one time, and you're a congressman, and you forgot about it because you're getting older and you forget stuff, doesn't change -- doesn't change -- not talking about anybody in this room.  Doesn't change the fact that metadata is just metadata.",2.0
for,"Let me move on something else -- Okay. Okay, most of the material that I put out in the Pentagon Papers, 4,000 pages that I gave to the newspapers, an additional 3,000 that I gave only to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it so happens, so there's some I didn't put out, it's very clear, by the way, that Snowden had an enormous amount of information that he could have put out. He says, and hasn't been challenged, that he chose not to because he thought it was not in the public interest. And a lot of what he put out was for background to the press in looking at that, but he relied on their judgment as to what to put out. In terms of when you say there was a difference in my case, in the 4,000 or even the 7,000 pages, there was actually no evidence of clear cut domestic criminality or even international criminality. So if it was whistleblowing, and I would say it was, that's not a requirement. I thought it was reckless, deceptive, dangerous decision making, and I felt it was still going on. And,unfortunately, I did not have the documents to prove what I was saying at the time from oral testimony I got -- Okay, right, let me address that. They revealed, of course, and it's the only way we know, that Clapper, director of National Intelligence, Clapper, gave a false statement to -- we know it from Snowden. Now, I do not believe, as Ben Wizner says, that actually he meant to deceive Congress. I don't believe he did deceive Congress. I believe that he, unchallenged by Congress, meant to deceive the public and did so effectively since Congress didn't challenge it. I just read a very interesting piece of background here by Mr. McCarthy which convinced me that Sensenbrenner is speaking very questionably when he denies that he knew or that his act covered that. That's the problem. Let me assume that Sensenbrenner is not telling the truth on this. I -- James Sensenbrenner who calls himself the ""architect of the Patriot Act,"" although, again, Mr. McCarthy said that was quite misleading. The point here is that Congress has been willing to deceive the public along with the NSA and the president regularly here, and that's the problem, that Snowden revealed. And I want to make a specific point here that was raised earlier on this metadata. Why are we talking only about metadata entirely here? First of all, there's a lot of text messages that are not metadata, 200 million a day, that get brought up. But what makes us believe that we were not listening on a different program -- I don't mean listening, I mean collecting recording for later retrieval -- all the content of the emails and all the content of the audio of the telephone?

They left it because it conflicted with the Constitution. They had tested the proposition -- that is, there are other ways to do it -- in every possible way.

The experience of going to IGs is simply a way of being -- and to your superiors is a way of identifying yourself as a troublemaker who will be suspected of being a leaker if there is a leak. That's why the four NSA people who had not been a leak to the New York Times -- which in my opinion, they should have been and certainly would have been more effective, that's why they were raided by the FBI and the computers, because they identified themselves as somebody who already thought the system wasunconstitutional.

Snowden provided a great deal of material to journalists. He entrusted it to journalists, at The Guardian, at The Washington Post. It's since expanded to the New York Times and other newspapers. His instructions to those reporters were that they, in consultation with their own editors, using their own judgment of what was in the public interest, and inconsultation with the United States government, should publish what the public ought to know and should withhold what the public should not know. My view is that the reporting until now has been extremely responsible. There has not been an article published that didn't give at least the government a chance to weigh in.

All of this we know because journalists engage in competition with government for what the public ought to know and what it shouldn't know. Now, what Snowden did was on a larger scale. He gave a large amount of information to journalists, and those journalists include journalists around the world. I think part of what he wanted us to understand is that this is not about demonizing the NSA. The threat of mass dragnet surveillance, of collecting information about all of us in case one of us comes under suspicion, is a threat to all free society. We don't know the answer yet. We don't know what has still to be published. And it's possible that the most important revelation that Snowden provided to journalists has not yet been published.

And I've been trying to give one specific example of that, when Russell Tice has said numerous times and in public that he had evidence, personal knowledge, of targeting of every member of the Armed Service Committee, every member of the Intelligence Committee, including Feinstein, her staff, and home, prepared to testify that under oath -- when he said that he wanted to testify, NSA immediately sent him a letter, which I've seen, saying, ""You are --"" this is to the Armed Services Committee, your old committee -- and he said, ""I want to testify to Armed Services.""

He said he had no intention of releasing that or taking it with him to China or anywhere else that he took the classified information, because that would not be in the public interest. Now, should we believe him? Well, some say, ""No, it's allgiven to China."" First of all, I trust his judgment as to what the public ought to know or not know about NSA more than I trust the judgment of anybody who said, ""None of this should be known to the public."" I don't think their judgment is to be trusted at all. And I do trust -- subject to analysis. It's the Congress and the courts, and it's the four people in NSA -- plus Tice -- have all said it is essential that there be a group of technies, nerds, hacker types who have the technical knowledge, reporting with full access to NSA data, reporting to Congress and to the judiciary, and that's the only way we will get this system under constitutional control.",2.0

for,"Can I respond to this briefly? Yeah, because I think that we may be slightly on the wrong track here. Sometimes the scandal is something that is illegal that's going on, that people don't know about, that Congress doesn't know about. And what the proper channel is, to go to Congress and alert them -- sometimes the scandal is that a whole regime has been created in secretthat the system deems legal. And that's what we're talking about here. I believe that these programs were briefed to the committees. I believe that the intelligence committees routinely approved this and were briefed on this, that they were taken to General Alexander's lair, where he had Hollywood set designers design a captain's chair and had the doors whoosh open and close like on the deck of the Starship Enterprise -- this was in an article in Foreign Policy Magazine. I believe that they knew what was going on. So, a 29-year-old contractor calls up Congress and says, ""Excuse me, I need to really tell you what you have wrongly approved in secret"" -- no. What was needed -- -- was for the public to know. And once the public knew, everything changed. Well, you know, again, I treat with great skepticism the claims that we're less safe. The Nixon administration, in trying to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers in the New York Times told the Supreme Court that their publication would cause great and irreparable harm to the security of the United States. Now, that was nonsense. And the lawyer who wrote that brief said so 15 years ago in an apologetic op ed in The Washington Post. I think he's claims of harm to national security don't age as well as whistleblowers who age very, very well. But look, we're not just talking about protecting ourself from a threat of terrorism, which, although severe, is not a common occurrence. We're talking about protecting our republic. And sometimes our republic is more threatened by what we don't know than by publication of things that also alert our enemies. That detention that we face in a democracy, but the cost of democracy is that our enemies have to hear this too. We have to strike the balance in the right way. My view is that the balance was way tilted towards overclassification and secrecy before Edward Snowden. Well, actually, I think with a long term effective, Snowden's revelations will make us safer in a critical respect. They will have an effect on the infrastructure of our communications, that -- one of the effects is that we will begin to prioritize defense, securing our communications over offense, manufacturing vulnerabilities in order to facilitate surveillance, this is a tension that exists within the NSA right now. I think that the spies have won out over the cyber defenders.

Some would disagree with their doing that, but they have done it, precisely to avoid danger of the sources and methods that you're describing of causing definite harm. Now, in -- that is a first point which hasn't been made here exactly. But the fact is that Wyden and Udall --John Donvan: Congressman Wyden. Congressman Wyden -- senator. Senator Wyden and Senator Udall in fact felt that it was outrageous, that it was shocking to the American people if they knew that, if they knew this stuff, and it was probably unconstitutional. This is part of the intelligence committee. They knew that Clapper was lying when he said that. They could not put it out, supposedly, because the rule of the committee was to keep that secret. I would say they made a very poor judgment there. I'm critical of them. Obviously I'm on their side on many aspects of this. But I think they were not justified in choosing to stay in the committee, the price of which was to keep that secret from the American public that they thought should be public in order to keep that -- to cooperate in keeping that secret. The fact is that keeping your mouth shut -- and we are talking here about communications intelligence matters here, which were covered by 798. I had clearance for that at the time. I did not put out anything. ",2.0
for," I want to close with a few observations about the surveillance apparatus that Edward Snowden, through journalists has exposed. For much of our history, our privacy was protected as much by cost as by law. It was simply too expensive for governments to track most of us most of the time. Now because of technology, for the first time in our history, it's technologically and feasibly possible, financially possible for governments to track all of us on a massive scale and to collect and store the majority of the world's communications. We now know that the NSA has built that capability and has used it in ways that are profoundly troubling to many of us. Polls show that 6 in 10 Americans think that the NSA's surveillance practices have gone too far. But Edward Snowden was even more concerned about what the NSA might do with these capabilities, say, in the aftermath of a traumatic terrorist attack. He believed that the weak protections that are in place right now were likely to be swept away and that our country's system would be replaced by one that looked very, very different. Now, whether and with what controls we should entrust our government with those kinds of enormous powers is a hugely consequential decision in a democracy. We should have debated this issue before the NSA deployed a global dragnet surveillance apparatus. We didn't but it's not too late to debate it now and to impose strong democratic controls. Now, I began this debate by quoting President Obama, and I'm going to end in the same way. Just a few weeks ago he gave a speech in January about NSA surveillance and the reforms that he would be implementing and proposing. And President Obama repeated his words from June. He said, ""One thing I am certain of, this debate will make us stronger."" The president of the United States believes that the debate Edward Snowden launched, a debate that no one can seriously argue would have taken place without him, has made our nation stronger. I can't think of any stronger justification than that.",3.0
against," I want to take a couple of minutes to describe one incident in my time as director of Central Intelligence, and it's how I think things like this ought to be done. A newspaper reporter was working on a story, and from the questions that he was asking and whom he was asking them of at the CIA it was quite clear that he was onto an extremely sensitive operation that we were conducting, a legal one, I would say, and one that was of potentially great benefit to the United States but extremely dangerous. We did not want him to pursue that line of investigation. He was persistent. I indirectly approached his boss, the editor of the paper. I got nowhere. And so I asked if I could go see the editor of the paper, one-on-one. And the two of us talked. And I said, ""I'm going to do something that no regulation authorizes. Would you promise me you'll never say anything about what I'm going to say to you here to anybody ever?"" He said, ""Yes, I'll promise."" I said, ""Okay, here's the problem,"" and I explained how we were almost certainly going to lose one of our officers and one of his sources killed if we continued to see the kind of material coming out that his reporter was working on. We talked. We got together again the next day and talked. And we figured out that if he would just eliminate any reference in the reporter's story to time and date and leave the story the way it could be without mentioning either date or time, that we could probably have a reasonably secure situation. He thought about it for a bit. He was not used to having suggestions in the editing of his newspaper come from the director of the CIA. But he -- -- he thought for a second, we shook hands on it, we did what we said we were going to do, and the story went forward without the time and date, and the operation succeeded.",3.0

They did not accept all the objections, but that in every case they have done some. I think that's appropriate. On one question that's come up again and again here as to what might happen with this American NSA government, Congressional collection of potentially everything -- everything including content. Let's call it potential at this moment. In fact, I would ask Mr. McCarthy what he believes the collection storage agency for NSA data being built in Bluffdale Utah right now is for, if it is not for audio and video content. As Tice has said, it is in use right now -- and part of it. And all the digital data in the world -- that's e-mail, chat logs, credit logs, everything -- can be stored in a small room. This huge facility is being collected, he believes, for content. And I wonder if you believe otherwise. When it comes to 9/11, if anyone here in the audience -- or at this table -- believes that Edward Snowden -- or any of us -- wants to increase the risk of another 9/11 or is indifferent to that, I think they are being very foolish. When it comes to having gone to Congress, I think he learned from the example -- specifically of the NSA four people that I've talked about, plus Tice -- that that would be a foolish thing to do.
