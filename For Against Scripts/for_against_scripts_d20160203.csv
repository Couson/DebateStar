for,"Yeah, my partner is someone who knows how to think clearly about matters of life and death, both on E arth and above it, the chief bioethicist NASA, please welcome Paul Root Wolpe.",
for,"Yeah . I think a small part of everybody is intrigued by that idea . I'm intrigued by a lot of other ideas and I have a lot of other desires, too . That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good idea for me or a good idea for society.",
for,"So, thanks very much . A philosopher and a social scientist are about to debate t wo sc ientists. And I invite you to look and think about the different ways that we approach this than the way they will . I'm going to take a sociological and psychological perspective . And my esteemed colleague, Ian, will take a philosophical perspective . It's hard in seven minutes to cover this kind of question and say why it is that I think the pursuit of immortality is a wrongheaded idea, or as Ian has coined it, ""Indefinitely long life."" And I invite you to think about that acronym . I'm all for healthy aging . And I'm all for what we call biogerontology . To make ourselves more healthy and to make our lives more productive . First, before we continue, there's one important clarification . And this gets conflated a lot . And if we conflate it, we'll get nowhere . Life expectancy has increased, almost doubled . Lifespan has not. All right? People lived into their 90s and even into their hundreds for centuries . Nobody has lived to 130, as far as we know. But lots of people hav e lived to 100, 105, 110. And that's our lifespan . It seems to be programmed into us that we can't live any longer than that. So, let's not conflate life expectancy -- which has increased -- and lifespan, which has not. We all want to live longer. May be even forever. But I think the quest for immortality is a kind of narcissistic fantasy . It's about us. It's about me . It's not about what's good for society . It's not about what's good for everybody . It's what I want for myself . And there's a certain adolescent nature to it . Who thinks they're going to live forever? Who thinks of themselves as immortal? It's when we're young. And as we get older, we get a certain kind of wisdom, I think, that mitigates against that . The goal of anti- aging is not to lengthen days, but to actually conquer death. It's part of a larger scientific, technological utopianism -- very post -humanist in its presentation -- that has this kind of idealized view of how technology is going to change the basic nature of the human condition. It's a modern utopian fantasy . And it's not about whether it's possible . It's about whether it's desirable . And if we just put enough time and energy into our technology, we can have a kind of perfect world on E arth. It h as no connection to the live reality, in my view, of being a human being . And in fact, I think of it as rather dystopian. Why? For millennia, we've tried to solve the problems of poverty, of war, famine, nationalism. We still have all of these problems. We haven't conquered them . Technology hasn't conquered them . We always think the solutions are right around the corner. But suddenly, if we get to live to be 200 or 300, somehow, things will be better . Things won't be better . I don't believe. Not for us. Not for society, and where should we put our energy? So I am not up here to argue that lifespans are long enough. And I think the question is phrased wrong . What I want to argue is the pursuit of indefinitely long life, to make that a goal in and of itself is wrong headed . Will life extension make the world a better place, a kinder place ? Has extended -- has life expectancy increase made it better ? I don't think so. I've never heard a single argument from the other side about how t his would benefit society ever because I don't think there is a plausible one . It would benefit me to live for a very long time. It has all kinds of problems when you think of it as a social expectation. It's a deep desire of individuals . But, as John said, the life expectancy has doubled. Does that mean that now we respect our elders and we have so many more older people that we turn to them for wisdom ? No. Almost exactly tracking life expectancy increase has been a fetishization of yout h in the West, a youth culture. And we haven't become more attentive to the wisdom of all these old people we have produced, and there's no reason to think if they were 200 or 500 that we would be any more attentive to them either, not to mention the fact that it has been shown over and over again that as people get older they get more conservative and that youth come in with new ideas and new innovations. And there is a wisdom to the evolutionary process of letting the older generation disappear . If the World War I generation and World War II generation and perhaps, you know, the Civil War generation were still alive, do you really think that we would have civil rights in this country, gay marriage ? That's a generational shift that happens o ver time. We would be obliterating generational shift and inculcating a deep kind of conservatism . I think we underestimate the cost, as Bob was saying . Look at Japan . Overpopulation is one possibility, over -resource utilization, disruption of work . You know, we work for 50, 60, 70 years and then we're tired . We're still going to be tired if we live to be 200 . So the idea that if we live to be 200 we'll work for 150 years and then retire just makes no sense to me . You want to be a longshoreman for 1 50 years? I don't think so . It's more strain on social services . There's this idea that we're going to be perfectly healthy and live to 200 or 300 and, I don't know, get hit by a bus or something. B ut I'm just not sure that the lived experience of being human maps with the kind of utopian vision that we hear about this . There are already generational tensions. They're just going to get worse. Prolonged life will also help the older people accrue greater wealth . It will actually contribute to, I think , inequality . So I want to end by suggesting that this is a fantasy we all have. It's something we all want to some degree . But when you actually go deep to the social desirability of it, what its impact is going to be for us as societies, it's not going to be something we want . We already have older people who are retired who spend their days nonproductively . I was just talking to someone beforehand about his mother and my mother, who live really waiting for the time that it's over . Their spouses are dead . Their attachment to life has diminished . That's why Ezekiel Emanuel wrote in the New York Times that he is not going to want to live past age 75 and he will stop all medication at that time.",
for,"The interesting question here and the real question is , ""Are lifespans ever long enough?"" I'm here to try and persuade you that if we answer that question as human beings , and that question is about human beings, the answer must be yes . What is an indefinitely long life ? Well, it's a life which , from the point of view of its owner , can be led with no thought as to its ending or decline . Our opponents think, one, we would all rationally choose such a life . Two, we all have the right to have this choice fulfilled . Three, as you've just heard, this right trumps everything else including the issues that affect our societies and our species, humanity . This reasoning is, first, based on an error, second, depends upon an impoverished conception of morality and what matters and, third, ultimately amou nts to our rejection of the human. Why the error? Look, we all want to live . We always want to live . They think it was from that that we want to live always . This is invalid. There are some goods which we might -- we might say we want more of, but they are in fact intrinsically finite . I might say, ""I don't want this movie I'm enjoying to end and I'm really sad when the credits roll."" But that doesn't mean I want to see movies that never have endings -- -- and therefore no middles or beginnings for then they wouldn't be movies . What we actually want when we say we always want to live is more of this life, at least more of the good things about this life in our world in which this kind of life still has meaning and value . And how does our life get meaning and value because this human life is one shaped from the inside start to end, top to bottom, by the facts of growth and development, our experiences and choices, and our relationships with others and their lif e stories and our place amongst the generations and the human story . We should not assume that a life unstructured by those facts is just more of our current life, a recognizably human life . It is not. Think of a decision like, ""Maybe it's time I settle d down and made a commitment to this career or this person or this place."" What makes that a choice in the economy of human motivation and evaluation and decision are the opportunity costs . Well, these opportunity costs are priced in the currency of our most precious resource -- time . You might think, ""Ah, wouldn't it be wonderful if I had an indefinite amount ofthat precious resource?"" But spending that precious currency is, in reality, the price of being a particular person. Being this kind of person rather than that. We become particular people by making those choices . So, to say we address the most profound problem of life by abolishing death is like saying, we'll solve world poverty by abolishing money . By contrast, actual human liv es, in all their glorious particularity, the indefinitely long life is the life indefinite . To embrace it, we'd have to rethink why we value what we do . For example, since few occupations are indefinitely satisfying, we'll need to live life with our finger on the soft reset button. Burned out as a teacher ? Ah, retrain as a neurosurgeon. Got bored with that ? Great . We need more people in sales . You can start in the mailroom. How many of us really want to start all over again from the bo ttom like that ? And do we really think that , if only we live long enough, we could all be neurosurgeons . To say otherwise is not to deny human potentiality . It's to recognize that with natural capacities come natural limitations . Fueling a fantasy here is the idea that what we really are are just things called disembodied minds, that we can kind of liberate from our biology and from the past. Our opponents are keen to point out that the human condition is biology all the way down . Hey, it's also biology all the way up . For it's not just our bodies that age. It is we who age . It is we who acquire memories and experiences, characters, and capacities . Natural gifts and natural limits . So maybe I have to get reset altogether. I get set back to kind of factory defaults . I get whole -- lose my experiences, my capacities, my memories, have new ones . But hang on a minute. Wasn't it supposed to be me with the indefinitely long life ? What's the difference between thi s factory reset guy being me and it being just someone ? So, the opposition seems to require two things -- that enough occupations are indefinitely s atisfying. So, they all want to flip burgers for 300 years ? No . Or that human beings are indefinitely ma lleable, that they are something other than particular people . So I think this indefinitely long life is unrecognizable as a human life , as a particular life, as my life . And our opponents, having argued invalidly from the thought that we al ways want to live, so we want to live always, compound this error by saying that choice overrides absolutely . So, believing we have a right to an indefinitely long life amounts to believing we have the right to be other than human. That's why they embrace post-humanism, or trans -humanism . Now sure, you can embrace that . You can think that, you know, being human sucks, especially the dying bit. And we better to be a cyborg, or a computer program, or an elf . But the thing is, you can't rationally want to be any of those things . You can want there to be elves, or cyborgs, or computer programs, but none of those can be you. So if you vote this evening, vote as humans, vote for humans, vote for the motion. Thank you.",1.0
against,"So, thank you for having me . It's a wonderful debate. And I'm going to try to use my time to get back to a little bit more pragmatism. We've heard a lot of speculation from the three s peakers already about what's life going to be like when we live to 150 . How society is going to change . Maybe we'll get bored. I don't know what those answers are . I don't think any of us do . I do think technology is going to change dramatically over that time period . But I think there's a more immediate problem to deal with . And that's the one I want to tell you about. And when you ask me the question, ""Should people live longer?"" my answer is, ""It depends."" You know, if I'm 80 years old and I'm having trouble getting out of bed and I'm taking 20 pills a day and I'm in pain all the time and I can't get out of the house, then maybe I don't want to live longer . Maybe I don't want to go through that period of decline . If I'm 80 years old and I'm healthy and I can go to the golf course, if I can go to work, if I can raise my grandkids and be with them, then I think my answer's going to be, ""I want to be healthy a lot longer . I want to be alive a lot longer."" And so I think that the question of lifespan is really not the question. The question is health span. So let's think a little bit more about what ""health span "" means. So I would define that as the period of time when you're disease -free, mostly at least, and when you're still highly functional. And you can compare the statistics on what's happening to lifespan versus what's happening to health span. Lifespan's going up . It's been going up pretty steadily over the last two centuries . Over the last 20 years -- it kind of depends on what gender you are and where you're from --but essentially lifespan is going up about one year in every four . So you're getting about a 25 percent return on investment. For every four years you live, you can live one year longer. But we have a problem . And the problem is healthy life expectancy is not going up at anywhere near the same rate . So the current approach we're taking is to keep you alive longer but to keep you sick longer. And that's what's failing . And if you look at the health care system, we're spending 19 percent of our GDP on health care . And most of that is spent in the last six months of a person's life. And what are we doing ? We're focusing on treatment and not prevention. We're trying to wait till you get si ck and then spend a fortune treating you and trying to make you better . And if you look at the chronic diseases of aging, we're being very ineffective at that. The two places where we're having effects are diabetes and cardiovascular disease. And one of the major reasons why is we've defined risk factors for these diseases . Cholesterol is a 3.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease . High glucose is a risk of diabetes . And so when we define those risks and identify them to that pers on, we start treating it before they have the full-blown disease . We give them drugs . They have reduced cholesterol, reduced glucose . That's called, ""early stage prevention of disease,"" and it's very effective. Well, I've got news . Aging is the biggest risk factor for all of these diseases. It's the biggest risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it's far higher than cholesterol, for diabetes, for most forms of cancer, for all the neurodegenerative syndromes you're scared of, like Alzheimer's, macular degeneration, cataracts -- I can go on . And so what I'm saying is, let's look at this common risk factor and target that . And if we do that, we're going to be effective at preventing multiple chronic diseases simultaneously and keeping you healthy. I don't see that as very different than targeting one disease at a time . All we're doing is taking the thing that's in common with all of these diseases and trying to target that as a means to effectively prevent all of them or as many as possible. The good news is we can already do this in animals . We can give a drug to a mouse and it lives 30 percent longer. And not only does it live longer, it's healthy longer, it's functional longer, it's protected from cancer, it's protected from ne urodegeneration and a range of other diseases. It doesn't delay -- it delays disease, it doesn't prevent it. The animal still gets sick, but it compresses their morbidity . They're sick for a less period of time before they die, already achievable in animals . Let's go back a minute and also talk about the demographics. And I'm going to try to make this case for how slowing aging would benefit society because we need to look at what's going on now in the first half ofthe 21st century. We're going to lo ok back at this and we're going to call it the "" Age Age,"" because that's what happening -- that's what's happening . We have more older people on the planet now than ever before, and the numbers are staggering . 25 percent of people in 2050 are going to be over the age of 60 . You've already heard about Japan, 40 percent of the people are over the age of 65 . And they have a crisis because there's not enough workers, so worker shortages, health care costs going through the roofs . This is a problem, and people have defined it . They've called it the ""silver tsunami."" So, you know, it's not a question of ""What are we going to do if we keep you healthy and you retire and you have nothing to do?"" You're going to be working longer. And I think it's important that we think about ways to keep you healthy . If we do that, if we can make health span go up as fast as lifespan, people will continue to be productive . They'll continue to be active. They'll be -- have much less health care costs . We'll improve quality of life, and in this first half of the 21st century we're going to dramatically improve the economic structure of society . So I think immortality's interesting. I think it's a great debate to talk about. I have my thoughts on it . I can share them later. But I think that gets away from the main challenge we have right now, which is what to do about this aging population and how do we treat or prevent al l of these chronic diseases that are having a staggering impact on society . You all know somebody that has Alzheimer's disease . It's terrifying. And I think that we can actually prevent this . I think that it's a little bit like -- aging research is essentially prevention . It's like a car . It's doing the maintenance on the car to keep it working so that it breaks down later and that's what extending health span is . I think it's entirely possible if we put the effort into it . So, you know, we've heard about what's going to happen when we're 150 . Maybe we're going to be bored. Well, you know, if you ask me do I want to have cancer at 75 ? Do I want to have Alzheimer's disease at 85 ? Or do I want to be bored at 110 ? I know which one I'm going to take . So, I'm happy to have this debate . Thank you for coming . John Donvan:Thank you, Brian Kennedy, and that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is Lifespans Are Long Enough. Please keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the eve ning. I want to remind you again , after you've heard the arguments we're going to have you vote a second time and I want to remind you that victory will be declared for the team whose numbers have changed the most from the first and second vote upwards in percentage point terms . Now we move on to round two and in round two the debaters address one another directly and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in New York . Our motion is this: Lifespans Are Long Enough. We have two debaters arguing for the motion, Ian Ground and Paul Wolpe . We have had them say okay, they are not arguing that there is some magic number of lifespan and that they are supporting it. What they are arguing against , really , is the value and t he moral rectitude of attempts to expand lifespan significantly by focusing on stopping aging . They say it's not a worthy goal, that it is essentially an adolescent fantasy . It's narcissistic . They point out that it disrupts , essentially , the story of what it is to be a human being and that aging demonstrates nature's wisdom in the evolutionary process of letting older people disappear and a new generation take up the torch. The team arguing against the motion, Brian Kennedy and Aubrey de G rey. They define the expansion of lifespan as health span. They make a very careful distinction that they are not talking about letting sick people live on and on . They are talking about research and efforts to increase health for many, many years to co me and they call this defeat of aging the most important challenge facing humanity . They say that society will benefit in many ways by having people living healthier and longer, and they also point out in a very interesting argument that there is not much moral difference between deciding to take on aging as a disease you want to fight if you're already fighting Alzheimer's and cancers , you already have crossed that bridge . So I want to take a question to the team that's arguing for the motion, which means you're arguing that lifespans are long enough. You're essentially arguing against your opponent's vision of putting in an awful lot of effort into fighting aging and they -- this moral argument that they make -- that we're already in a world w here we have decided that it's a good thing to try to cure the diseases that come with old age, cancer and Alzheimer's, heart disease . We all more or less agreed to that . So we've already decided by proxy that we want to fight aging, so there's not much different. Do you want to take that on? Paul.Paul",2.0
for,"I think what our esteemed opponents have done is turned an argument about whether extending life is a worthy value in and of itself to an argument about whether or not we want to be healthy . I spent my entire life teaching and working in medical schools and with scientists . I'm biotechnological geek . I love that stuff. I love medicine. I love health . I am all for all the research to cure those things . I am not against work ing on aging. And if a by -product of that is extending life because we make people healthier, great . My argument is against the idea that our goal is to live longer lives, not that our goal is to live as healthily as we can until we happen to die . That was not the proposition of this debate . The proposition of this debate was about lifespan itself. It's an intention thing . An intention is very, very important morally . Is my goal to live as long as possible for the purpose of living as long as possible or is my goal to live a healthy productive life and die whenever it is that I happen to die ? I'm not actually sure we're as far apart as, you know, it might seem . B ut the proposition we were supposed to ad dress was the nature of life extension itself and whether that, in and of itself, is a worthy goal -- and that's where I draw the line. Live a long, healthy life. Yeah, I think that I understand that, Aubrey, but it's a little bit disingenuous here . The reason people find your views, in particular, so interesting is not because it's going to help their granddads not have dementia or something . T hey find it because you seem to be offering to them, as you said, 1,000 years of life, okay ? That's the thing they find fascinating and wonderful and turns them on. It's disingenuous to say, ""That's just a matter of health."" And your argument is that people have a fundamental moral right to live indefinitely . It's a very peculiar notion of rights, okay, very peculiar. Rights come in sets . They conflict. Very controversial that one, ok ay? Hang on . Just a second. You're saying we have a right to live indefinitely? Aubrey de Grey: Sorry? Your view is that we have a right to live indefinitely, a right, mind you? Aubrey de Grey: I say we have a right to live , however long ago we were born. Ian Ground:Of course.",2.0
against,"Well, I think the majority of people don't -- -- aren't fascinated by the idea of living forever . I don't hear that when I talk to people . What I hear is, ""I'm scared of getting sick."" And I really think that it's a little disingenuous to say we're going to ke ep people healthy and have them just die on a certain day. If we do that, they're going to live longer . I actually want to live longer. I'll admit it . I'm not sure about infinity, but I want to live longer and I think most of the people out there right now are worried about disease . They're worried about getting sick when they get old . And, really, I think aging research is just a way of trying to target multiple diseases simultaneously.",2.0
for,"Well, I -- you know, so we keep talki ng cross purposes because the proposition that I am arguing against is living longer for its own sake, not health, not living well into old age, but living longer for its own sake . And that's what I think is deeply problematic . All of us want to live healthy lives . But I want to -- I do want to correct one thing . When they take polls of people, older, healthy people are majority against wanting to live to 150 or 200 . It's not that people turn 80 and they look in front of them and see illnes s and that's why they don't want to live these long lives . If you propose healthy living for another 70 years, the majority of elderly people say they wouldn't want it. It's this utopian fantasy about aging and it misunderstands the nature of the dynamic s of human life which happens in stages, which has a course that makes a kind of natural arc of human life . And to say that at the end there, that we’re going to stretch it way out or that we're going to start new phases of life , is not a lived experience of being human in life. Well, again, this -- it's about the end of life and the arc . But actually, our lives are conditioned in advance by these sorts of considerations . For example, do we make choices based on opportunity costs ? Okay? How much time we have ? You can't marry everybody . You've got to choose somebody, okay ? Aubrey de Grey: Speak for yourself. You can't live everywhere. Underlying, I think, this kind of fantasy is really the thought -- a kind of weird thought -- that you want to be everybody . It's kind of a strange idea, I think. But you've talked -- let's push a bit more on this, if I may, about the kind of a reachin g escape philosophy-- where the difference -- how much difference we can make in someone's lifespan -- or health span, if you want to use that term, healthy living. We're happy with that. Okay? Lifespan grows as they get older . So as they gain 10 years, and then the science moves on . Well, that is to commit. That just is to commit to the idea of indefinitely long l ife. That's what you're saying in your answers. I’ve got a question I want to ask you about that . Like, for example, does this work with the punishment business going on? How many years do you get for a major felony now ? Do you stay in jail for 300 years now ?",2.0
against,"I think that we talk a lot about what old people are . And first of all, I think that doesn't embody the -- a lot of the old people I know . I know a lot of people that are very active, very creative . And I think they -- there are a lot of people that want to do new things -- train for new jobs . They learn languages, develop new careers . And I actually think -- we talk about them as old people who are conservative. That's a good thing . So, they vote conservatively, sure . But let's look at why they're conservative . Are they conservative because some life experiences taught th em that they shouldn't be liberal ? Or are they conservative because the biology of aging is changing, and that's changing their behavior ? People say old people are not as innovative as young people . Is that because they're older ? Is that because the biology or is that because of they just ran out of ideas ? I think that if you target aging and keep people younger, you're actually going to find people that are a lot -- even when they're old -- they're going to be a lot more innovative . They're probably not going to be as conservative . They're going to be taking more risk . And they're going to have the wisdom that comes with being older at the same time . And it might be beneficial. I think there was a narrative arc in 1900, too . You know, lifespan was 47 . You had to have more kids because a couple of them were going to die during childbirth, because if you didn't die yourself you had to try to avoid the bad water that was all over the place . You had to not get infectious disease and hope you could survive long enough to see your kids grow up if you're lucky. That's not -- that was a narrative arc . I don't think we want to go back to that one. And --",2.0
for,"Can I just come back on the conservatism point very quickly. I mean, the reason why people will get more conservative as they get perhaps older is not because they have -- you know, their innovation neurons die off. Aubrey de Grey: How do you know? It's because they are --Aubrey de Grey: How do you know that? -- people have become particularly -- because it's become -- they've become particular people, they've invested in certain values, who have narratives about themselves . It's a sense making business, okay? And the new stuff doesn't fit. It's not because their neurons -- you can ’t replace the neurons and suddenly they're in favor of everything the young kids are in favor of -- no . That's not how it works. That's just neuro -reductionism. When I hear the arguments you're making against, I keep thinking that the argument doesn't speak to the points that we're making at all . None of us are against aging – are arguing against aging . Thank you. I'm all for research to try to stop Alzheimer's . I'm all for research to stop the ravages of aging . And as I said before, if that leads to a longer lifespan, I'm not going to say, you know, ""Well, let's execute everybody at 120."" My point is what -- look, intention is an important ethical and moral issue . And you constantly are avoiding it . If your intention is to make people healthier, we are --everyone in this room is for it. If the intention is to increase lifespan for the value of living to 150, I have to say that I think that agenda is misguided not only because for all the reasons I gave but we have poverty in this world. We have famine in this world . We have war in this world . And is the morally compelling purpose of our technology and our lives to make me live to 150 because I have a right to live as long as I want, or should it be put in service of some greater value than my narcissistic desire to live to 200 ? I think it is quite extraordinary . You know, when we say hey, this may not be the only issue that matters to society at the moment and to humanity , that when we pose the problem we go that does n't matter, right, that's irrelevant . Because we can solve that by artificial intelligence or going to Mars or something like that . So, we're multiplying the miracles here to deal with the problem ? But look at the real issue. What do we really know ? We know things like Moore's Law about technology . It doubles. It gets better and better . There's no doubt this will happen with the science . We also know about the Matthew effect. Inequalities tend to grow, okay . Let's combine those two. Who do you think is going to be the people living the longest? Is it going to be you ? Or you ? It's going to be the billionaires living longer. I'm not sure I understood Aubrey's question. I answered it twice, but I can't seem to get this word into people's minds . It's intention. My argument is against an intention. The intention to live longer for the sake of living longer . That sounds a bit like, you know, the dinosaur saying, ""Don't worry about the meteorite . It' s all right . We're going to be birds."" You know. Maybe . Who knows what's going to happen in millennia or the hundreds of thousands of years . But what's crazy is to start aiming at that now as if we can bring it about, okay ? – Who knows what will come about -- -- that's why it's called natural selection.",2.0
against,"""Who knows what's going to happen?"" is exactly the point I want to make, too. And making speculations about how it's going to be bad to live longer, I have -- I guess I have more faith in humanity than that. I think that I don't know what's going to happen with technology of that sort in the next 50 year s. I just hope I'm healthy and alive in 50 years to figure it out when it happens.",2.0
for,"Fourth row.John Donvan: Fourth row, thank you . Told you I'm not that good. Okay, the human lifespan is about 120 years . That's how old the oldest humans live . I'm all for us all living to 120 years healthfully or even beyond that . That's not the issue . The issue is if you look at -- if you look at species on this planet, there is virtually no species and certainly no mammalian species that lives any longer than that . It seems to be the natural lifespan of advanced species on this planet. Now, that doesn't speak to its value or its rightness . It simply says that throughout the entire existence of this planet, evolution has for some reason put a certain limit on how long individuals of species live . And my argument is we have to take that seriously . It's not the defining issue. But I think there's a wisdom to it that we completely ignore and say, ""We should live as long as we want,"" to our peril.",2.0
against,"Can I comment on programmed aging ? First of all, I want to say that I think there are a lot of people that have all kinds of religious beliefs and other beliefs, and it's never my intention to go jam pills down people's throats . And we want to hope that -- we want to find ways to keep people healthy longer . But I think it is about individualism and choice. I don't -- this concept of programmed aging has come up a couple times . And I think most of the field does not believe in programmed aging . First of all, there are a lot of species that live longer than we do . Whales live a lot longer than we do . Clams live a lot longer . Plants live 2,000 years . I mean -- but let's leave that aside for the moment. I think most of us feel like aging is what happens when natural selection stops . In other words, natural selection care s about fitness, which is basically reproduction . It means living long enough to have healthy children and pass on your genes to the next generation . For almost all of our evolutionary history, we weren't living long enough for it to matter whether we we re healthy at 80 or 100 or not . So natural selection breaks down with age . And then the bad things that happen, the diseases that happen, occurwhen natural selection is no longer working as well. That's the common view of aging in the field. And so this idea that there's some program that defines how long we can live I think is -- there's very little evidence to support that. Yeah . I think that's an important question. And let me first state that I'm not just advocating drugs . There's lots of lifestyle choices that people can make that extend their health span and may extend their lifespan as well -- exercise, diet . And I think those things are important to think about. The comment about the drug -- actually, there are multiple drugs that extend lifespan in animals . And we're very close, I think, to doing a clinical trial, looking at health span in humans . This is something that Nir Barzilai is heading at Albert Einstein, and the drug in question there is Metformin. It's the same drug we've been taking -- lots of you are taking for diabetes, probably.",2.0
for,"Yeah . It -- actually, I unde rstand the question. Thank you for it. But when people are engaged in an activity which they think itself is kind of indefinite -- like, for example, pursuing science, okay ? They think they can kind of hook themselves up to the indefinitely delivered va lues of that. Right? And so, they'll be fine, because they're doing -- they're engaged in a project which is essentially endless . And that's -- so you often hear this argument from people who are -- engaged in scientific inquiry . I understand it. But we're thinking about society much more generally, and not just scientists, okay ? So, tell me how you think that some -- the ordinary Joe, okay -- the New York taxi driver, how is he going to respond to that? I see that as another sort of scientific , technological utopian idea . We don't have anything that's free now, even things that have saved thousands of dollars. The idea that there's a finite amount of human need in terms of health and so if you solve one thing and free up money, it's now free, we can't cure basic diseases here . We now have Zika and Ebola and MRSA. We have people in Africa dying every day of cholera. I mean, this is a utopian fantasy that we're going to solve a problem, it'll free up all this money, and it'll be free for everybody . It has never happened in human history . And the idea that it's going to happen now seems to me to be deeply unrealistic.John Donvan: All right, just -- Aubrey de Grey : B asic education.",2.0
against,"It needs to happen now, by the way . Access to health care is one of the major problems whether or not we do anything about aging . The lifespan of the richest quartile in the world is 80, and the lifespan of the poorest quartile in the world is 54 . So this is a problem that exists today and it's one we need to focus on solving today, not if we develop some drug down the road.",2.0
for,"And it's not about aging . They don't live to 54 because of aging . They live to 54 because of infectious disease -- Brian Kennedy : I agree. -- which we can cure. That’s a good question and thank you for it. It's not so much what's defined by the negative spaces, as you put it, by death, but that we -- even from within life make choices that presuppose that time is finite . Okay . That's how it works . We have to put down -- say we put down roots, okay . You can't be a being that puts down roots if you're going to jump up in 50 years' time and go somewhere else, okay . It's a different way of conceiving of the human, okay . I'm saying well, fine, maybe you really don't like the human, okay, and you'd rather have something else . I've got no argument against that. I know what I prefer . That's all. But that's the problem, Aubrey . You'd do -- people do think you're making philosophical claims about the wonderful possibilities that are there before the human race, okay . That's why your views are so interesting to people, not because of the small practical interesting things you may actually be doing, and it seems to me disingenuous again, okay, to say that that's not part of the appeal of your views . It's the immortalists, the people who if they can't get the treatment that you're trying to produce are going to have themselves cryogenically frozen instead . John Donvan:I think he's got you there. The public reception -- tak e an answer . Aubrey de Grey: So it is abundantly true that the noisiest most vocal people when it comes to commenting on what I think are people who make their money by sensationalizing it, but that doesn't mean that I actually say what they say I say . I know that as a serious academic understand that it's better to actually read Wittgenstein rather than read commentaries on Wittgenstein if you want to know what Wittgenstein thought, and I would submit that it's the same for me . But you have said, Aubrey, that the person who will live to be a thousand years old is alive today . Aubrey de Grey: Probably, but that's the technology But that’s a claim that's a claim that makes people say, “Wow. Maybe it’s me.”",2.0
against,"We talk about this over -population problem if people live longer and I think it's just not true . First of all, the most developed, longest living countries in the world have the lowest birth rates in the world. Japan has 1.3 children per couple . We're not going to be talking about too many Japanese . We're going to be talking about zero Japanese in a thousand years . And that's true with almost all the developed countries . So I don't think lifespan, longer lifespan, goes hand- in-hand with higher population. Also, you have to realize that population growth is a geometric process . It's about how many babies you're having . Dying is a linear process and it has a much smaller impact on the global population . So I do think, let me clarify, I do think we need to be concerned about global population, I just don't think modest increases in life expectancy, which go along with development in health care are going to lead to over- population in these countries that are actually leading to under -population.",2.0

for,"I want to bring you back to the idea of the indefinite life . I was at a philoso phy conference once and someone asked the question, ""Well, what are people of faith? What age do they think we are in heaven?"" And someone said, ""Ah, you know, you're in your prime,"" 38, 40, something like that . Someone said, ""Yeah, but what age do they think you are in hell?"" Someone went, ""Huh."" I know, 14 or 15. That was terrible . Your bodies are all weird . You hate everything . You have no idea who you are . You're always right but nobody believes you. And this made me think actually that if you want a kind of picture of the psychological life of someone leading, the serious matter here, the life indefinite, okay, the 1,000 -year old that we're offered here, okay, think of a teenager. At least with some of them, their life has no shape, okay ? Their identities are fluid and painful . They have no conception of shared finite resources . Their memories only reach back over a small period of the past and, yes, they really do think they will live forever. Look, not all teenagers are like that, but think about the worst times when you were a teenager, okay ? That seems to me a kind of clue to thinking what it will be like to live this kind of indefinite life, okay ? Now, my story has an ending . After the discussion at the confer ence, there came a lone voice from the back and someone said, ""No, no, no . You're all wrong, okay ? In hell, yeah, you are in your prime . Everybody else i s 14."" To vote for this motion is not to vote against health, okay ? It's not to express a death wish . It's not about health spans. It's the vision that's offered of indefinite life . Vote toexpress the wisdom that there's more to life than just more of it. Vote for the motion. Thank you. In his last great speech before he was assassinated, Martin Luther King said, ""Like anybody, I would like to live a long life . Longevity has its place, but I'm not concerned about that now . I just want to do God's will . And he's allowed me to go up to the mountain . And I've looked over . And I've seen the Promised Land . I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land ."" When life is forever, what's worth dying for? When life is infinite, what's its value ? Do I want to live forever? Sure . In my own -- some part of me, in that sort of reptilian, narcissistic, ""I'm so important, center of the world"" yes . I have that survival instinct that all organisms on this planet have . But I think we're greater than that as hum an beings -- greater than pursuing life for its own sake . Life's beauty and preciousness is partly due to its transience and the bittersweet knowledge that we will all die, and that through that transition, other lives will live and flourish . And I think the most noble part of who we are as human beings is exactly that -- is our willingness to give our lives, our willingness to discount the value of ourselves for the benefit of others. And that's why I find so much of this conversation deeply problematic to me as an ethicist . What is the real value we're pursuing here ? If we're pursuing health in the service of a well- lived life, great. If we're pursuing long life itself, it seems to me to be a deeply misguided value.",3.0
