for,"So far, they haven't really changed sociology, but it is inevitable that they're going to. And there's a very simple reason for that, and that is that the things we do on apps are recorded by the companies that make them. And we can turn that into data that we learn to discover all kinds of things about our secrets, the things we do. And actually, I should say that is just one of the many unromantic things about dating apps.",

So, people are correct when they say, ""We have chemistry.""",

against,"So, I love this question. So, I think one certainly, you know, is a lonely number. But like all questions, the context matters. So, if we're talking about the number of relationships in the world, then zero is the loneliest number because it means that everybody's alone.",

for,"Thank you very much. You heard I'm a sociologist. I love sociology. I can't stop doing it. So, I thought, let's start tonight by getting to know each other a little bit. I'm going to do an old-fashioned instant survey to get us going. So, let me just ask, how many people in this room -- can you clap, please -- if you have never done online dating -- if you've never used an -- -- oh, this is the National Public Radio crowd here tonight. And can you also clap loudly if you have used a dating app? Alright. Alright. We have -- people, we have a future. Can you clap if you're single? Oh, special reception for you after the debate tonight. Clap if you're married, please. Okay. Somewhat disturbing. And just finally, if you could clap if you're currently in an extramarital relationship. Whoa! Ashley Madison, a dating app that is not dead yet. So, look, I have spent years studying modern love and romance. I have traveled around the world doing interviews and focus groups with people who are single. I have studied the data that come from dating companies. And I can tell you that it's true -- millions of people are using dating apps and many are finding relationships. But we are here not to talk about the numbers so much as to talk about the experience. And let me tell you that the experiences of people who use dating apps are anything but romantic. And let's remember why we're here tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Our question is not ""Are dating apps popular?"" They are. We concede that. It's whether dating apps are bad for romance. And Manoush and I tonight are going to tell you why they are. But before we can do that, let's define the term. What is romance? Let's go to the Oxford English dictionary, a great source for this. It tells us that romance is this kind of feeling of mystery and wonder -- Helen has written about this -- that we get around love, but there's something else in the definition that's important to me. It's the sense of being swept away, remote from reality, away from everyday life. It's that sense of being preoccupied with some other person. You think about them and care about them so much that everything else kind of melts away. You forget about the mundane. That's the feeling that we try to recapture when we go on vacation, or when we go on a date, or when we make a meal for our special person. Right? It's that idea that we're lost in love. There's not another care we have in the world. Now, it is worth nothing that since the advent of the Internet, marriage rates have gone down. There are more people in the world who are single today than ever before. There are more people who are living alone. Still, I think that most people who are looking for love are able to find it, and technology won't change that. The thing is that dating apps are making just about every part of our search for love less romantic. Think about it. If you've been on a dating app, you know that it encourages you to treat people like products. People routinely lie about their height, their age, their weight, their income. They put huge amounts of attention into their photograph -- and for good reason. About 90 percent of the action -- online dating -- is about the quality of your picture. Are you hot or not? 90 percent. But then we sent out heartless and sometimes cruel messages -- things we would never say to a person in person -- because the phones encourage us to treat people like bubbles on a screen. Unfortunately, the things that we do online are changing the culture. My fellow sociologists say that they're changing our norms, making us ruder, and flakier, and more self-involved. Have you taken a selfie recently? Here's the most important thing. Dating apps make it harder, not easier to be swept away by another person. Why is that? Because the phone demands our attention. It is always telling us that there's something or someone that deserves our attention more than the person we're with or the thing we're doing now. That's true for new couples, but it's also true for established couples as well. I mean, think about it. How often have you come home at night, if you're in a couple, looking for affection and connection only to find your partner cuddled up on the couch with his iPhone? How romantic is that? Real life and real relationships have a hard time competing with the stimulation that apps give us. On dating apps, the problem is there's too much going on. Today, people go into their phones, and they perceive a world of limitless dating choices. And unfortunately, this means it's very hard to settle on the person that we're with. We're always wondering, isn't there something better out there? Let's go online and find out. I have interviewed people who are on Tinder while in an Uber on their way to a date that they organized on Tinder hours before. And this matters because romance and love don't come from superficial connections. It's not really about whether you're hot or not. At the end of the day, romance is impossible without sustained face-to-face contact. What's important is not the quantity of our dates; it's the quality of our interactions. And the main reason that you should vote for the motion tonight is because apps and the phone culture that they're part of have made spending quality time with another human being a very hard thing to do. Thank you.",
against,"Thank you very much, John. I really appreciate the opportunity to come out here tonight to debate. So, I usually don't do media or public speaking things. Like most people, it terrifies me. And being a programmer, I'm more likely to talk to a computer than another human being. But, you know, even though I'm not going to be as eloquent as Eric just was, I'm going to do my best. So, hello, everybody. My name is Tom. Hello. So, I grew up in a small town of Wayland, Massachusetts. And I attended Carnegie Mellon University where I graduated with a degree in computer science, as John just told you. And, you know, after graduating, I moved to New York to join this crazy startup called OkCupid that was trying to use the internet to help people find love. And, you know, working on a dating app, you know, let me tell you some of my interests. I love to travel, love candle-lit dinners, long walks on the beach, and writing algorithms. So, I care a lot about the topic of dating apps and romance. You know, it's literally what I've spent the last eight years of my life thinking about every single day. And I may not look like a traditional matchmaker but today, you know, as Eric told you, I am the typical matchmaker because, you know, dating apps are the most common way to meet people now. And today, you know, I'm going to show you that instead of killing romance, the data actually shows that dating apps are creating romance. And even though Eric didn't want to talk about the numbers, I do. So, you're hearing things from him about bad behavior, having too many options, you know, arbitrary, irrelevant algorithms, which I take offense to. You know, but what you won't hear is, you know, them citing a number of studies that prove their point because the data isn't there in the context of dating. So, I've got three main points that I want to get across tonight. The first point is that more and more people are using dating apps to get together. You know, since building momentum in 1995 when the first dating apps started coming about, there's been a steady increase in the percent of couples that are using dating apps to get together. This is especially true of people who were marginalized before, the handicapped, the LGBTQI community and people over the age of 55. You know, says -- a quick question to the audience, and remember, it's radio so make a lot of noise. Who knows somebody who's in a relationship because of a dating app? That's a lot of people. Turns out you're not alone. A number of studies estimate that over 40 percent of relationships today come from meeting on a dating app, and over 70 percent of LGBTQI relationships do. A recent study, called the Strength of Apps that got global attention in 2017, says that we're actually seeing an unprecedented rise in the number of interracial marriages. And this sharp rise in interracial marriages correlates exactly to moments when popular dating apps were released -- things like Match.com, OkCupid, and, yup, Tinder. This is what dating apps do. They break down barriers and allow you to connect, form relationships, get married to people who you might otherwise never have the chance to meet. What isn't romantic about that? So, my second point is that it's working. Not only are people getting together, they're staying together and they're happy. Studies have shown that married couples who met online report higher marital satisfaction and have a lower rate of breaking up than couples who met offline. And you might be thinking, ""Alright. So, what? Anybody can cite a study that makes them look good, right?"" Well, let's talk about something you can't fake -- more data. It turns out that because marriages are registered with the government in the United States, the CDC happens to track marriage and divorce rates. Don't ask me why the CDC thinks that marriage is a disease. Don't know the answer to that one, but they've got the numbers. According to them, marriage has been steadily declining in the United States since the '80s. And this trend only began to change in 2009, where it started to bottom out, and it's actually started to rise again. You know, if you take a look at divorces -- and specifically the rate of divorces per marriage -- that's a trend line that's been going up over time. You know, people have been getting divorced more and more. But that trend also reversed in 2010. It's actually come back down to one of the lowest points in the last 20 years. So, now, well, correlation doesn't imply causation. You know, how could these negative trends have been reversed during the rise of dating apps? It's a hard pill to swallow. So, my last point is this. If dating apps have killed romance, where's the body? I looked everywhere. I couldn't find one. Qualitatively, people don't think that dating apps are killing romance. Pew Research surveyed 55 percent of people who don't use dating apps -- think that they're good. A lot of people who do use them -- 80 percent -- think that they're a good way to meet people. Quantitatively, people are still forming relationships and getting together. Again, over 40 percent of relationships today and over a third of marriages are due to dating apps. And you know, if this stuff didn't work, I wouldn't have a job. Dating apps aren't killing romance. They're making romance possible. And because of that, I ask you to vote no on the motion.",1.0
for,"I have the least degrees of anyone on this stage. I am not an anthropologist. I am not a sociologist. I am not a data scientist. I'm a mom of two kids. I'm a wife. I'm a journalist. And I host a podcast that is about how technology is changing everything in our lives. And my audience is extremely generous. Every day, we get emails and voice memos about how technology is specifically changing the way that they work, the way that they parent, the way that they fall in love. And oftentimes, they are looking for guidance on how to cope with this accelerating world. And so, that is what I hope to offer them on this podcast. But when I told them I was going to be doing this debate tonight, they had a message for you. In fact, they had a few things that they wanted you to know about their experiences on these dating apps. Some simply wanted to share the messages that they had exchanged with potential suitors. I'm going to read a few to you. And tell me if this would spark online romance for you. ""Hey!"" no, that's it, just, ""Hey!"" ""Nice legs even if you don't shave them."" Yeah, those weren't too bad. Can I read you my favorite? ""I'm looking to shove my head between your legs and bend you over. What are you looking for?"" I know. My kids aren't listening. I just want you to know that. To be fair, several of my listeners did say that they eventually did meet a special someone with the help of an online dating site. But like anyone who has spent time on these apps, they first had to run the gauntlet of lewd messages or spend time exchanging messages with people who seemed really interested but then just seemed to disappear from their screens. One person wrote me, ""All the apps have bots of beautiful people who seem amazing and educated and hot and available and who will engage you for a few sessions, but then they ghost you."" Okay, but let's say -- yeah, exactly. But let's say you do make a connection. Okay, let's stay positive. Let's say you make a connection with the person, a real person, with the help of an app, and you go on an actual date. Then what? So many people told me that the transactional quality of their experience on these apps just seeps over into real life. Chrissy wrote me, ""I have come to despise that look a man gives you when you first meet, the gleam in their eye, the smirk. It makes me shudder. Immediately, I have to decide how hard I'm going to push to split the bill because clearly they think they're buying something."" Ew. But at least that guy showed up. Listen to this story about a dude who really used one of these apps to manipulate people. Clip one. And that guy was actually her boyfriend at the time. And he broke up with her by posting a picture of himself on Instagram with his new fiancé. Good times. Okay. Now, listen. Have I shared with you the worst aspects of online dating? Maybe. And maybe you're thinking, like, oh my God, if it's so terrible, just don't do it, right? But here is the problem. The destruction of romance extends IRL, into real life. Even if you give up finding romance online, and you decide to look for love the old-fashioned way, in a bar -- -- this is what you will find. Clip two? ""No point in interacting,"" much less exchanging glances over a pint of Brooklyn Lager. Are you feeling tired? Are you exhausted by all these stories? Are you thinking, oh my God, this is so straining, especially for women. Yeah. Well, you're not alone. Here's Becca. My teammate told you how dating apps have destroyed romance. They've taken away mystery, remoteness. But I want to add that dating apps have destroyed another important aspect of romance, civility and conversation, basic emotional intelligence, eye contact, being able to read someone's body language and make them think, like at your best, like your best self, make them think that you are just amazing, and they are the most special person in the world, at least until you get to know each other, right? Look, we all know the internet is extraordinary. Information goes around so quickly we are connecting people all over the world. But is it good for romance? No. When human beings interact online, they often revert to their crudest instincts. Dating apps are no different and certainly not better. Give me a Twitter where people punctuate properly and treat each other with respect, and I will grant you a dating app that brings out people's most caring, loving, and romantic selves. Not gonna happen. And this is why you should vote yes for me and Eric.",1.0
against,"Good evening. I'm delighted to be here, and I'm delighted that you're here. I do an annual study with Match.com called Singles in America. We do not poll the Match members. It's a demographically and national representative sample based on the U.S. Census. We've done it for the last eight years and we've got data on over 35,000 singles of every age and every background. And today, this past year, 6 percent of singles met somebody in a bar -- I'm not surprised about that. 24 percent met through a friend and 40 percent met somebody on the internet. Moreover, 57 percent think that online dating is a good way to meet people. Are they all crazy? Before we get into deep yogurt on this, into the weeds on this whole issue, I'd like to add a broader, more evolutionary, more anthropological perspective to apps, to romance, and to human nature. And I'm going to begin with a story. I was traveling in New Guinea, in the highlands of New Guinea, and I ran into a man who had three wives. And I asked him, ""How many wives would you like to have?"" And there was this long pause. And I thought to myself, ""Is he going to say five? Is he going to say 10?' ""Is he going to say 25?"" And he turned to me, and he said, ""None."" A lot of wives can be a real toothache. We are a pair-bonding species. Even in polygamous societies, the vast majority of men and women pair up with one person at a time. And along with the evolution of human pair-bonding, millions of years ago, we evolved the brain circuitry for romance. I study this brain system of romantic love. I and my colleagues, Lucy Brown, Bianca Acevedo, and others, have put over 100 people into a brain scanner, using FMRI to study the brain's circuitry of romantic love. And we've been able to show that the main circuits lie way below the cortex, where you do your thinking, way below the brain regions linked with the emotions -- at the very base of the brain linked with drive. In this case, the drive to find life's greatest prize, which is a mating partner. In fact, this brain system lies right near the factories that orchestrate thirst and hunger. Thirst and hunger keep you alive today, romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on somebody else and pass your DNA on into tomorrow. This is a survival mechanism and it will not die, whether you swipe left or right on Tinder. In fact, if you're concerned about killing romance with apps, what about the automobile? In the 1950s, we suddenly had a rolling bedroom. What about the birth control pill in the '70s or Viagra in 1998? Technology cannot change the basic brain structure of romance. Technology is changing the way we court, and you're going to hear more and more about that. In the past, people pulled up in their horse and buggy and wooed at the lunch -- on Sunday lunch. In my day, they called on the phone. Today, people email, and text, and meet, and seek a mate on the internet with apps. It's just the newest way to do the same old thing. In fact, these really aren't even dating sites. They're introducing sites. The only real algorithm is your own brain. When you go out and meet the person -- and you've got to meet the person -- your own brain snaps into action and you court the way you always have -- smiling, laughing, listening, watching, parading, the way you did long before apps. In fact, romantic love is a little bit like a sleeping cat. 34 percent of singles have fallen in love at first sight. 45 percent have gone into a friends with benefits, thinking it's just going to be a one-night stand, and it turned into a long-term committed relationship. And 89 percent of singles today believe that you can find the -- if -- when you find the right person, you could remain married for life. If that's not romance, I don't know what is. And I think they're looking in the right place. I did this study myself with Match, and I found that people who use internet to date have more education, are more fully employed, and more likely to want to marry. These sites certainly do have problems. But like any new technology, you've got to learn how to use it. And you've seen how people are not using it properly tonight. The biggest problem -- and it was mentioned by Eric -- is cognitive overload. The brain is not well built to choose between hundreds if not thousands of alternatives. So, what I would recommend is that you stop. If you're a dating person, after you've met nine people -- the brain doesn't deal with more than about nine -- stop and get to know one person more. And the more you get to know a person, the more you like him, and the more you think that that person is like you. Actually, I think romance is expanding due to something that I call slow love. Today, singles are taking different routes to love. Many of them are just hanging out for months before they even kiss. Others are working slowly into friends with benefits, then slowly into dating somebody. Dating has actually acquired a new significance, more important. And then slowly into living together before they marry. What we're seeing is a real extension of the pre-commitment stage before we tie the knot. Where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship, now it's the finale. And we have even more time for romance. So, nobody gets out of love alive. You've heard about some of these people. We all suffer on the internet and off the internet as the poet William Butler Yeats once said, ""Love is the crooked thing."" It is. But I will close with this, the drive for romance and love is one of the most powerful brain system the human animal has ever evolved. Apps have their problems, but apps cannot, never have, and never will kill the brain circuitry for romance. Thank you.",1.0
against,"So, I think that there are some fair points they brought up, you know? But one of those points that was brought up was -- is Facebook good for news? Well, I'd actually say yes. I think Facebook and Twitter have been great for news. Facebook and Twitter allow people to get information more directly from the source. Dating apps allow you to expand your options and get down to the point of meeting people who you're actually going to talk with and connect with and get to know.",2.0
for,"Well, I think, using this word romance, as a journalist who doesn't believe that Facebook is good for news -- and in fact, it is destroying what has been held true -- -- and how we disseminate information -- I would argue that when we say -- for example, Helen says 70 percent say that online dating is a good way to meet people. That is not disputed. What we're talking about is romance. And that has all kinds of -- you can't quantify romance. That is a moment where you have butterflies in your stomach or your -- you meet -- I'll give you an example of a young woman who told a story to me yesterday, who said she met this guy and he ticked all her boxes -- literally. He was a doctor. He was tall. He had brown hair, all those things. He even had a golden retriever. And they -- -- she's like, ""It's happening. It's happening. I did it online. I'm going -- we're meeting. He's cool. It's 2:00 in the afternoon."" He's like, ""Do you want to go for a walk? Do you want to meet my golden retriever?"" She was like, ""Yeah, I do."" Well, that was code. And -- sorry -- meaning that she went back to his apartment, and he was like, ""Well, let's get into bed."" She was like, ""I really just wanted to meet your dog."" Like, that -- There was a dog. But -- there was a dog. But my point being that romance is subjective and numbers are not. So, while we say -- -- 70 percent are meeting that way, that does not mean that romance is happening.",2.0
against,"Well, it's interesting that they keep on talking about one individual here and one individual there, whereas we are talking about huge numbers of 40 million people. And -- thank you. And all of our data shows that one-third of relationships -- Manoush, relationships -- -- start, you know, on the internet -- relationships -- and that one-fifth of all marriages. There's romance in relationships. There's romance in marriages.",2.0
for,"I think that people are beaten down. I mean, like getting -- Like when Tom says people are getting together and staying together, that's because they're too tired to move on, people. I mean, at some point you think, you know, how much longer can I play this numbers game? Let's just call it, you know? The game's over. And as someone who's been married for quite some time. Some days there are romance, some days there are not. And I think what Eric actually and I -- has said to me that I found very fortifying is actually that romance that you have at the very beginning of a relationship bodes well for you down the road because it's a touch point that you can go back to. Thank you for that, Eric. Just so that sociology doesn't get left out of here altogether, because I -- we do have some numbers. Oh! So, the book I wrote before I wrote ""Modern Romance,"" is called, ""Going Solo."" And it is worth saying that there are more single people in the world that there have ever been before. There are more people who are living alone than there have ever been before. And that when I interviewed enormous numbers of people -- and by the way, I have no self-interest in this. I have no company that's paying me to do this. I mean, the data is all about me being a scientist and trying to get things. Well, we should take that into consideration because if it was 30 -- Sure, but -- but here we have to be very careful. So, if it was 30 years ago and we were debating whether cigarettes were bad for you and the cigarette industry told us, ""Here's our evidence,"" we would all say -- -- ""well, how do we judge that?"" So, let me say, for the sake of science, that there is incredible disparity in the numbers of what we get from different sources. Yes, that's right. So, the Match.com data is different than the data that we get from other surveys. And for instance, let me just pick one -- let me just pick one bone for a moment here. The claim that the rise in interethnic marriage is coincident with the rise of online dating. This is not a claim that holds water. The preeminent researcher of this is Mike Rosenfeld from Stanford University. He's a dear colleague of mine. He wrote a book called ""The Age of Independence"" that I know well from my work, and it shows, that the rise of intermarriage happens when young people start marrying later, get places of their own, and free themselves from parental control, and so therefore can make decisions about who they want to interact with, who they want to mate with without that kind of pressure before. And so, to say that this is about online dating is just plain wrong. We have to adhere the facts.",2.0
against,"Well, two things. First of all, I loved your book, ""Going Solo."" But I think we used to agree, actually, that made people hyper-connected because these days, over -- people write over 15,000 emails during the course of one year. We're hyper-connected. You can't walk down the street without dodging people because they're so busy connecting with everybody. So, you know, I mean, this is not a -- going solo doesn't necessarily mean that these people are sitting in their -- you know. That's number one.",2.0
for,"No, just different than romance.",2.0
against,"Number two. I want to do talk about this interracial marriage, too, because I don't know if we're referring to the same article. But I was really moved by a particular article that really -- there's two things that we actually do know that inter- -- that online dating is helping, and it is increasing more interracial marriages. And I say that because in this data of -- we have at Match, of -- they have. I'm just a consultant -- of 35,000 people, we ask what you're looking for every year. And the top things that people are looking for is somebody they respect, somebody they can trust and confide in, somebody who makes them laugh, somebody who makes them -- gives them enough time, and somebody who they find physically attractive. And way down the road is ethic background. Over 70 percent of singles today would go out with somebody from a different racial group. It's a great question, and I will answer that in one second. But I have to respond to Eric. Okay, I love that you brought up Michael Rosenfeld, because Michael Rosenfeld is actually quoted in a recent -- This is -- just for a second. Okay. Onto algorithms. He said he sees no negative repercussions. So, I think there's actually a huge misunderstanding about these algorithms. You know, people like Manoush will say, ""What does hair color have to do with your soul mate?"" And Manoush is right. It has nothing to do with your soul mate. But we don't look at things like hair color, or eye color, or height, or weight. We look at practical, behavioral measurements. We look at who's online. If you go to a bar, the people that you see are the people in the bar with you. One of the most prominent features of the algorithms are that when you go online, you see people who are online with you too. It's the same kind of things that give you the opportunity to see who's responsive, who's open to actually meeting, who actually talks to each other. Those are the people who we promote, the people who you are going to have the best chance of having a good, positive interaction with. If you behave poorly, you get reported -- So, one way that we account for it is we actually don't filter out all sorts of people, just because they disagreed with you on one thing. What we do is we present to you the people who are available, and we try and show you things that you can use to connect. Well, it turns out that you happen to agree that ThunderCats was the greatest -- you know, greatest thing of all time as a child.",2.0
for,"-- super cute. John, the motion -- Dating apps -- there's a whole wide – -- spectrum out there. Well, the -- Thank you. But can we just go back to the thing that Helen said -- which I think is kind of brilliant? But there's something a little off about it? It's that Helen, who believes in these dating sites, will always tell us, ""Your brain is the best algorithm."" Right? Get off the sites. Get face to face. We completely agree on this. Your brain is the best algorithm. People, your brain is not an algorithm. Your brain is something else -- there's something else going on with you as a whole person. And I think we make a mistake in thinking that we can game this, that we can get this right quantitatively, that there's a model -- because you don't really know, until you're with that other person, whether you have a spark. And the other thing is, it doesn't happen in 10 minutes. We know from the best research that the way to get at what is really distinctive, and human, and special about another person is to spend time with them. Go on a second date. Go on a third date. -- -- No. But -- But -- -- but I am, because what I'm saying -- and Manoush is saying this also -- is we are actually filtering in a very different way, which has to do with images. And we wind up making decisions that don't give us a chance. So, over time, over years, are people going to still procreate and find couples?

Goodbye.""

And we -- I've actually spent an extremely long period of time, over the last year, really delving into, how can we better deal with spammers and scammers like the ones that you're describing? And you know, I do think that it's a big deal. And I do think that those types of scammers tend to try to prey on the elderly -- because, again, they are a vulnerable class of people that don't have other mechanisms of meeting people. And so, what we do is we actually pay very close attention to that. We take a look at, you know, where are you signing up from? Are you signing up from some third world country in Africa, claiming to be in the United States? All sorts of things like this. And you know, really, at the end of the day, what you're describing is a very serious problem that we pay a lot of attention to, and we've reduced the number of complaints that we've had by over 90 percent in the last year of things like that.

And to say that, again -- you know, we debated the inter-ethnic marriage thing. But can we say that the way I learned about how rampant discrimination is in online dating is from the OkCupid research site that Christian Rudder maintained, where he documented so thoroughly the penalty you pay for being African-American or from being an Asian man, or from being perceived as third world on these sites? To think that discrimination disappears because we now have a chance to meet other people -- I think -- is off-base.

for,"But can we geek out for one second here to say that it's not about what . I'm going to go a little deeper, because as you have said repeatedly, it is not about what we say we're interested on a survey. It's what we reveal when we act online. And if the data tell us that African-American women get three quarters of the affection and attention of all the other groups online and that an Asian man would have to earn an additional $247,000 to stand on equal footing with his white counterpart, that's important information we get from looking at people's reveal preferences through their behavior.

And again, this is the type of thing that I spend every day trying to make better. And guess what? It is getting better. People are more willing and more -- more and more willing over time to reach out to these people. That doesn't mean that discrimination disappears overnight. But because there's more exposure to different people of different backgrounds, that's how we get to know each other and bridge those gaps. Oh, no. You can take it. It's about -- It would be nice if arguments worked that way. So, yeah. I mean, again, like, so your point is that, you know, there's so many options. People are talking to you all over the place, you know, and that's not romantic, right? Well, you know, I’d kind of counter it two ways. One is that, what about the people who don't have any other options, the people who are scared to go out, maybe they're not openly gay, and this is a mechanism where they can use these apps to actually meet people that they don't otherwise have, right? Now, that doesn't mean that your point isn't a valid one, right? Like there's a lot of attention. But, you know, what happens if you go outside to the bar? You're going to meet tons of people anyway. Like one of the main complaints that women have when they go out is that people are hitting on them, giving them unwanted attention, and they don't have, you know, the power or the mechanisms to just make those people go away. Well, guess what? Dating apps let you just swipe those problems away. Oh, I just wanted to -- wondered why you thought the nastiness was just on apps.

Should I -- All right. Total confession. When I first met my now husband, I just -- like he didn't do anything for me, like at all. It was a work situation. And then we ended up talking, and then he was really funny. And then he had the weird smell thing, like Meredith was talking about, like he smelled right. And we never would have been matched by a dating site. We argue about religion constantly. But we have two beautiful children, and most of the time we're really into each other. So -- I just think that there's something to be said that we're talking about an industry that is 2.7 billion dollars a year. And it wants to grow, right? So, it makes sense that it wants you to think like there's amazing people on there and they're gorgeous, and they're just like me -- or they're different, but we're compatible anyway. Look around. One woman told me that her son made a match, and she was so happy. But the irony was that the woman worked in the same building as him.

Whether it's rating people by what they look, or dealing with extremely rude, racist, sexist comments. It's a tough road to you to get to this wonderful thing that you're describing.

But as you have seen from the headlines, Silicon Valley's utopian belief that tech is always a force for good is being tested. We're seeing it be tested from a consumer perspective, from a civic perspective, from an economic perspective, and tonight, I think from a romantic perspective. We're living in this age of self-experimentation. And I think we have to be able to say, like, no, this isn't working. This is gross a lot of the time. We don't feel good about ourselves. A lot of the emotion that I saw in some of the people standing up to ask questions is very real. Maybe the data doesn't show it, but the stories are extremely important. And Silicon Valley needs to listen more closely to the people that they're peddling their wares to. So, let's let that -- let's let the companies know, apps are killing romance. We need to see change. Humans can now conveniently order their groceries online. You can, with a tap, order up a car. But you should not be summoning romance through an app. The motion is right. Vote yes to the motion.",3.0
against,"So, several years ago I was traveling in Tanzania with one of the last remaining hunting and gathering tribes called the Hadza . And through an interpreter, I asked a 12-year-old boy if he had a girlfriend. And he said, ""I saw a girl. And when I grow up, I'm going to kill a zebra and give her the tail."" Around the world, people love. They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose songs and stories and ballets and operas and movies about love. They retell myths and legends about love. They have love charms, love potions, love magic, and love holidays like Valentine's Day. We pine for love, we live for love, we kill for love, and we die for love. In fact, the oldest love letter that I saw in Istanbul was from 4,000 years ago. It was written in Kunena form on a lump of clay. In those days, people most likely romanced in person. And as I've been up here tonight, I began to wonder whether they once had a debate called ""Kunena form is killing romance."" The real thing -- thank you. The real thing that is changing romance is not apps, it's women piling into the job market in cultures around the world. This is the huge social modern trend. In fact, marriage has changed more in the last hundred years than it has in the last 10,000. But romance has not changed. It's like a bamboo tree of Oriental literature, sways in the breezes of time, but it always springs up again. Romantic love is adaptable, primordial, and unquenchable. So, I hope that Tom and I have made a compelling argument for you tonight. And I will conclude with this: To anybody in this room who's looking for love, and anybody on the airwaves who are listening here tonight who is looking for love, apps cannot, will not, and never will kill romance.",3.0
for,"I've read the histories of procreation, of evolution. And let me say at the outset, procreation and the reproduction of our species is not romance. If you read about the history of men and women getting together and think that that is a love poem, I don't know what book you're reading. Like it or not, social life today is rooted in the internet. I know some 11 and 12-year-old kids, too. I have an 11-year-old boy. He's been talking all about Instagram recently and Snapchat. He needs to be on it because if he's not on it, he is missing out on where all the action is. He is not part of the conversation. He has to be there. And when I talk to single people, they tell me the same thing about dating apps. But that doesn't mean that they love it or that they're finding the romance they want. I'm married. My wife is here, and I've spent the last decade of my life writing books about the culture of single people. Bless you, honey. Imagine explaining that to your spouse. When I started this work, I and many of my male friends said, ""Boy, it must be pretty great to be a guy in this world of the -- of the swipe apps, online dating. It seems so easy to find love and romance. You just click a button or swipe left or right."" And when I finished all this research, I thought the opposite. Thank God I have escaped that cesspool of humanity online. We've heard all about the downsides of digital dating, the ghosting, the pointless messaging with strangers, the racial discrimination, the crass treatment of women, the utter terror of it all. And right now -- right now, one in five people in this country are -- say that they are online during all of their waking hours, essentially. So, as we approach Valentine's Day, as we think about how to heal together, could you please join me in thinking that we would all be better off if we had a little bit less time with our screens, a little bit less time on the apps, and a little bit more time with each other, face to face?

So, I'd like to take a moment to tell a personal story of how dating apps have affected me. Despite coming up here today, I'm actually a pretty shy guy. I'm not the kind of person who just walks up to someone at a bar and says, ""Hello."" And when I graduated college and was moving to New York City to work at OkCupid, I didn't know anybody. I really didn't have many friends. And I didn't know what places to go. But I did have a dating app. And I got to see firsthand how it worked, and you know, how much the people who worked on it cared about how it worked. And so, I made a profile and started using it. And I realized I wasn't alone. Thousands of other people in New York my age, were looking for someone too. And then, when I was busy trying to find somebody, that someone found me. She messaged me, and we ended up talking and chatting for hours. And the more that I knew about her, the more I wanted to know. And after talking for a while, we finally met. And the more time that we spent together, the more precious it became. Eventually, I realized that not only did I want to spend the rest of my life with this person -- that I didn't want to spend a moment without her. Her name is Natasha, and she's the love of my life. She's actually standing -- standing -- -- in the audience tonight. Stories like mine are the reason that I came here to debate tonight. If you vote yes on the motion, you're saying that you believe the world will be a better place without dating apps and that it would have been better if couples like my wife and I had never had the opportunity to meet. Saying dating apps killed romance is saying that other people looking for love should be denied that same opportunity. The reason that I do what I do for a living is because I think everyone should have that opportunity. And because of that, I urge you to vote no on the motion.",3.0
