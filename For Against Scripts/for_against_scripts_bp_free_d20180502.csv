for," I can do that. So, Track 1 is official diplomacy between governments, and Track 2 is unofficial dialogue among non-governmental participants. And at the risk of sounding particularly wonky, Track 1.5 is somewhere in between. It includes a mix of official and unofficial participants. I got into it by accident mainly because I was a fellow at the Department of Defense at the legal office and I went with my colleague to a meeting and I had no idea what they were going to be talking about and I had nothing -- no ideas about these issues and they were talking about the Strategic Arm Reduction Treaty and I said, ""This is really cool. I want to do this."" So, I've been doing it ever since.",nan

Love of sushi and Toro. I think the biggest misperception is that either the United States or North Korea reads the other side's signals as intended. This is often a major problem in international politics, never more so than in a relationship amongst adversaries, but because there is so little diplomatic contact between our two countries and the relationship is so fraught, signals are harder than ever to read between these two. I may have done so gently. I may have.",nan
for,"Good evening. When I was first told that I would have an opportunity to be a part of this debate and that my motion would be that Negotiations Can Denuclearize, I said, ""Of course. Of course. Why not?"" But then I said, ""Let me step back a bit and say a little bit about why I have that perception."" I have spent my life working in the area of nuclear nonproliferation, chemical, biological, nonproliferation arms control. So, I spent my life sitting at the table with others negotiating treaties, working with the delegations, drafting treaty texts, and really making the what may seem impossible possible. Sitting at the table finding out ways in which we can find common interests to find a way and a process for agreement. So, I have been in a world of the possible. I've also done some research on this. Actually, my topic for my dissertation was why do countries decide that they want to or not develop nuclear weapons? And how does nonproliferation actions really play a role in their decisions, that decision making? And I have found out in all of the research that a very important part of this is the leader and what the leader wants to do. And when a leader decides that it's ready, that their country's ready to give up a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapon program, then they're ready to sit at the table and talk. And we have examples of countries giving up nuclear weapons or giving up nuclear weapons programs. We have Argentina and Brazil. We have Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. We have South Africa. All of these countries decided at some point that they wanted to give up their nuclear weapons or their nuclear weapons program. And at some point, a leader made the decision that that as the right thing to do. We have Iran. We all know about the Iran agreement. That was also an agreement that many said could not happen. That was an agreement that many said, ""We'll never get to an agreement with Iran for them to stop their nuclear weapons program. But there were fortunately some that believed that it was possible. And as a result, after many months, we have the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Agreement. So, it can happen, and it did happen. And there's no reason why it cannot happen again. Of course, we do have one wrinkle. It's North Korea. And the problem is, we have a history. We have a history with North Korea, where there have been agreements and those agreements didn't work. However, we're not saying that you should not take account of these things. In fact, when you're going into a negotiation, you should take into account the past. And as you prepare yourself for the positions you're going to take, you should take those things into consideration, and that will help you decide how you're going to negotiate and what you're going to try to get from the other side. However, those are not reasons not to negotiate, and it's not reason to think that you cannot reach a conclusion. You can never give up on diplomacy. You can never give up on trying to reach a conclusion with another side. And what is the options? Do we want to go back to where we were? It wasn't that long ago. Do you want to go back to the point where there was a lot of insecurity, where two countries with nuclear weapons were facing each other, where there was a lot of rhetoric outside, where there was a lot of things being said? That's not a situation we want. We want to be at a point now, after all the saber-rattling, after all the words, to finally say, ""Okay, let's sit down and talk,"" because we think we can make a difference now. And the table is set. We have all these negotiations. We have the meetings between North Korea and South Korea. We had the meetings with North Korea and China. We have the upcoming meeting with the U.S. and North Korea. Why would these be happening if we didn't think it's possible? What's the point of doing all of this if we can't have denuclearization? So, the table is set. The time is right. We've had our saber-rattling. We've had everyone do their thing with the -- you know, ""We're going to threaten you with this and threaten you with that."" Okay, now, let's step back and let's do what we need to do to make sure that we can come to some decisions and some agreements on denuclearization. Understanding the past is important, but it should not prevent you from making progress in the future. And for that reason, I know that you all will vote for the motion, that negotiation can lead to denuclearization of North Korea. ",nan
against,"There is no bargain that can fully denuclearize North Korea at the negotiating table. That is what we are arguing tonight. If our opponents can convince you of the opposite -- that there is a clear deal that Kim Jong Un would prefer over his now complete nuclear arsenal -- than you should vote for this motion and against our position. But throughout this debate this evening, we ask you to keep in mind one critical definition, and that is the definition of denuclearization. Denuclearization is the complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament of North Korea and its nuclear weapons program, as defined by policymakers and the Trump administration itself. And that is the heart of what we are debating tonight. In the time I have remaining, I want to make three brief points. The first is that North Korea believes it needs nuclear weapons to survive. The second is that the United States does not have a reasonable substitute it can offer North Korea. And the third is that by chasing a denuclearization pipe dream, we put ourselves at considerable risk. First, North Korea believes it needs nuclear weapons to survive. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, and tens of thousands of American troops still on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea invested in its conventional military, arraying artillery all along the Demilitarized Zone to ensure that South Korea and the United States could not invade it to topple the regime. Since the 1980s, it's had an active and secretive nuclear weapons program, and it first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006. It's now had nuclear weapons for over 10 years, and it sought them in order to add nuclear deterrence to the conventional deterrence it already possessed, to ensure that it would never be invaded and that the regime could survive. Since coming to power, Kim Jung Un has invested more in his nuclear programs and his missile program than his father or his grandfather before him and in the last few months has finally declared them complete and North Korea's survival assured. For North Korea nuclear weapons are existential. They're a matter of survival and they are something that are now guaranteed. So, what could the United States possibly offer up in exchange? Well, it could offer North Korea logically a security guarantee, a promise that it would never be invaded and that the regime would never be toppled. Sounds like a pretty good thing to offer, but the only problem is we've offered it countless times before and we've always been rejected. Take, for example, a 2005 agreement by which North Korea agreed to denuclearize completely in exchange for a public U.S. promise of a security guarantee. That North Korea then violated. In private, North Korean nuclear negotiators repeatedly tell their American counterparts that U.S. security guarantees can't be trusted. They point to examples of the United States invading Iraq or invading Libya, having disarmed their opponent and then invaded those countries to topple the regime and show those as reasons why our security guarantees cannot be trusted. Why would they accept now what they have never accepted in the past? Now that their nuclear arsenal and weapons program is complete. Third and finally, by chasing this denuclearization pipe dream, we risk missing the diplomatic opportunity at hand and courting catastrophic conflict. We cannot buy what is not for sale and North Korea is not selling its full nuclear weapons program right now, but by continuing to chase that goal we allow North Korea to keep building nuclear weapons. What we can do is do much better than we've done in the past and that means pursuing realistic goals towards obtainable ends. Arms control that will return weapons inspectors to the country and get a handle on these programs. Working with our allies to contain and deter North Korea and prevent it from spreading the world's most dangerous weapons. But if we chase a promise that Kim Jong Un has not made and does not intend to keep we face two very real risks. The first is that we make real concessions in exchange for a promise that is not real at all and miss this diplomatic opportunity. But the second and worst still is that when the Trump administration awakens from its denuclearization dream it takes us to the world of our worst nightmares. It returns to a world in which it is considering a war on the Korean peninsula. Something that was all too real just a few months ago. Finally, I want to conclude by being clear about what we're not arguing tonight. We are not in favor of the use of force. We are in favor of diplomacy towards realistic and obtainable goals. We ask you to vote for smart diplomacy towards meaningful ends and to vote against this motion tonight.",nan
for,"Good evening everyone. I'm so happy to be here. As we saw at the historic inter-Korean summit, Kim Jung Un told South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, that he was ready to give up his nuclear weapons in exchange for the United States ending the Korean war formally and promising not to invade their country. The two leaders signs a joint declaration that called for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and complete denuclearization. That was their common goals. This turn to diplomacy is most welcome, especially when you consider just months ago we were on the verge of war with North Korea. Of course, we've seen similar language in previous agreements and in previous failed attempts, but that should not stop us from pursuing what I think is the biggest opportunity for diplomacy with North Korea in almost 20 years. I understand the skepticism. In fact, I share it, but we shouldn't let the past failures get in the way of us trying again. So, when considering this evening's motion, I think there are three key questions we should explore. The first one is, is Kim Jong Un ready to come in from the cold. We've seen more of Kim Jong Un these past few weeks -- and heard more -- than we have during his entire six-year tenure as North Korea's leader. My best assessment of what's behind this unprecedented outreach is that he understands he needs to do this in order to gain acceptance of a new strategic policy you just put forward. This is the policy of economic reconstruction. In my informal conversations with North Korean senior officials, they have explained that they do not want to amass a humongous nuclear arsenal; they want just enough to deter an attack by the United States, and then turn their attention to economic development. This follows Kim Jong Un's Byunjin line, and that's a national policy that has, on one track, the development of the nuclear program, and on the other track economic development. Of course, what we have seen over these years is Kim Jong Un pursuing relentlessly advancements in his nuclear program, at great cost to the well-being of the North Korean people. 2017 was a pivotal year for Kim Jong Un. That is when he declared the completion of his nuclear force in November, and then reiterated it again in his New Year's speech, just this past January. And this leads me to my second question: why now? The North Koreans say they now have a deterrent to deter an attack from the United States, which enables them to come back to the negotiating table as an equal to the United States, as a nuclear power. And let's not forget: Kim Jong Un is not his father. He's not his grandfather. He's 34 years old. He sees decades of rule ahead of him. And he understands -- he must understand that he'll -- that in order to maintain the Kim family dynasty, he's got to do something to address the economic conditions in North Korea. And there's only one way to do that, and that's to lift the sanctions. The third and final question is, how can we get to a successful outcome? And that's the most important question. I think we need to rigorously test whether Kim is serious about giving up his nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees and economic development. And to increase the chances for a successful outcome, we should be thinking boldly. We should be thinking of what kind of comprehensive package we're going to offer Kim. Peace treaty, normalization of relations. Security guarantees that of course would have to include Beijing. On the economic side -- we need to be thinking, in addition to the relief of economic sanctions, we need to be thinking about investment, trade, economic aid. As a senior advisor recently put it to -- said -- senior advisor to President Moon said, what the North Koreans want is a Trump Tower and McDonalds. So, surely Kim Jong Un knows what it will take to get there. So, I'd like to wrap up by saying that the wording of tonight's motion is particularly important; negotiations can denuclearize North Korea. The operative word is ""can,"" which points to possibility. If the motion was negotiations could denuclearize -- will denuclearize North Korea, I wouldn't be up here to defend that -- because the simple fact is, we don't know if that will be the outcome. So, ""can"" made all the difference to me. It's possible. So, please keep that in mind when you cast your vote in favor of this motion. And the way I look at it is a vote in favor of this motion is a vote in support of diplomacy. ",nan
against," So, as a child growing up in South Korea, and as an adult who spent almost all of my career following the North Korean issues, I have to say, when I saw the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, actually cross over the Demilitarized Zone and step foot in South Korea, it was a moving moment. You know, I got a little bit emotional. It was moving. It was momentous. It was historic. So, and I'm happy that we are now on this path of trying to sort something out, particularly since several months ago I was having sleepless nights because I was so concerned about all this talk of preventive military strike against North Korea. That would have had catastrophic consequences not only for the Korean peninsula, but for the region and for the world. That said, ladies and gentlemen, can negotiations lead to denuclearization? That's complete irreversible, verifiable. I do not think so. I think negotiations will lead to in another agreement with North Korea.  There will be an agreement between Kim and Trump. There's always an agreement. We have many agreements with North Korea. Every single time it fell apart over verification. We have 1994 agreed framework, bilateral agreement between United States and North Korea. We have 1999 Geneva Accords in which North Korea agreed to stop all its long-range testing missile testing. We have six rounds of six-party talks, which led to 2005 joint statement, 2007 joint declaration in which North Korea also agreed to show -- declare all of its nuclear weapons and disable all of its existing nuclear facilities. But we have not every single time agreement fell apart over verification. So, I don't believe negotiations will lead to complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. What have Kim Jong Un been doing since coming into power? Six and a half years he's done four out of six nuclear tests, including hydrogen bomb test that was 17 times more powerful than the one that flattened Hiroshima. He did 90 ballistic missile tests in six and a half years, 20 last year alone.  Last one the one in November 2015. That one showed a capability to reach all of the United States and North Korea has now declared itself a nuclear weapons power. So, this is what Kim Jong Un has been doing, speeding towards completing the nuclear program, accelerating towards it. And why? He has -- because he like his father and grandfather, believe that nuclear weapons is only way to guarantee regime survival. He has, like his father and grandfather, has pursued this program at costs of millions of lives and billions of dollars to pursue this program. Now he's completed it, but now he's going to all of the sudden give it up. When every single time Suzanne meets with North Korea officials, I met with North Korean officials. Every single time and I'm sure they told Suzanne this, too. They talk about Iraq and Libya. They don't want to be another Iraq or another Libya. In the case of Libya we said -- we convinced Qaddafi to give up his nuclear weapons program and then we backed and revolted and ended up overthrowing Qaddafi and killing him. How many times North Koreans have said Qaddafi's dead. I don't want to be dead. We don't want to be dead. This is the only way for us to survive. So, why did Kim Jong Un switch to the summitry and diplomacy? Well, there's a lot of things that he wants. He wants sanctions relief. He wants money, food, fuel to flow into pipelines. He wants diplomatic recognition. He wants international recognition as a nuclear weapons state. There were a lot of things that he wants, but it's not complete irreversible denuclearization of the North. Oftentimes, and I have to distinguish what does North Korea mean by denuclearization of the Korean peninsula? Because we -- Suzanne brought this up. There was a peace declaration. There was a declaration. What does North Koreans mean? North Koreans have historically meant by that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if the regime security is guaranteed and that doesn't mean just the north unilateral disarmament. He's talking about also South Korea. He's talking about breaking U.S./South Korea alliance relationship, getting U.S. troops out of South Korea and ending extended nuclear umbrella the U.S. has over South Korea and Japan so the regime can feel secure. This is what he means by denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. There's a long way to go there and we're not going to get there. Please vote for the opposition side of the motion today.",nan
for,"I think the -- trust is obviously very important. And when you're thinking about when you're going to negotiate with someone, you want to believe you can trust. But you don't have to trust somebody, necessarily, to have negotiations. You have negotiations because you want to come to a conclusion. And that's why you have verification. You have verification because you want to make sure that whatever agreements are made, that the other side will do it. We've had numerous negotiations with the Soviet Union -- with the Soviet Union and with Russia. There were times when we didn't necessarily trust them, but we still had -- we still came to agreement on arms control issues, on nuclear issues. And we had a verification regime. So, we were able to still make it happen. So, trust is -- of course you want to have trust. But if there is an important issue that you want to work on -- which is reducing nuclear weapons -- you figure out how to make it happen and then you verify.",2.0
against,"Well, I certainly would agree with the point, that you don't necessarily have to have trust to negotiate with an adversary. I don't actually think that trust is the crux of our argument here today. What we are suggesting, at least on the North Korean side, is that we haven't seen an indication of an interest in complete nuclear disarmament. We've certainly seen an interest in negotiations. And that's an idea that we very much support. We've see an interest in Kim Jong Un -- in getting sanctions relief. Maybe even in making some meaningful concessions that we could verify. But when it comes down to this fundamental question of denuclearization, it's not actually just a matter of trust. It's a matter of will, and we're arguing that we haven't seen it.",2.0
for," I think it's not a question of trust, when you're sitting down with an adversary -- and it's decades now that we've had this adversarial relationship. The right approach is mistrust but verify. And I think that's the approach we should be taking with the North Koreans. That's certainly the approach we took with Iran when we pursued the Iran deal. You know, I have to ask question. Is -- yes, regime stability now, nuclear weapons provide that for Kim Jong Un. But let's think ahead, in terms of the economic troubles that North Korea is facing. They're only going to worsen with the sanctions regime that's currently up against them. The situation is not going to improve. And that, in turn, will become more of a liability for Kim, is -- and threaten his regime stability there. So, I think, in my talks with the North Koreans, they are looking ahead to the years ahead, where that is going to harm them. So, that's the motivation. ",2.0
against," First of all, North Koreans doesn't trust us either. They say the 1994 agreed framework and that when the Bush administration came in he scuttled the deal according to North Korean perspective. So, they said look, we get it. You're a democracy comes in and you scuttle the deal and now we're looking at the Trump administration. If he scuttles the Iran deal how can the North Koreans trust us? And the same goes for us to them because of the gazillion agreements that we do actually have with them and every single time it fell apart, they fell apart over verification and Suzanne just talked about verify and verify, but that's exactly the crux of the problem. We were not able to verify every single time there was discussions fell apart over verification and just one last word on Kim Jong Un, on the man. Just because he's so popular now after all this summitry and diplomacy can we not forget that just a year and a half ago that this is a guy who killed his half-brother using banned WMD chemical weapons in a major international airport place?",2.0
for,"I think we can all agree that he's a bad guy. So, I don't think there's not -- Disagreement about -- I don't think they're disagreeing about him being bad and not being trustful and that he's broke promises. I think that's a given. I think the point here is that you have to think about how much is that going to weigh in which you want to do now? And do you want to say no to a possibility to denuclearize? Or do you want to say well, it didn't happen in the past. You're a bad guy. We can try to find a way to get rid of the nuclear weapons. We can try to find a way to make the Korean peninsula a lot -- peninsula a lot more peaceful. You know, there's things that we can try to do. Do we want to say we're not going to do it because you're a bad person? Or do you want to say let's sit down, you know, roll up our sleeves and think about how we can try to make this situation -- I think what you've been hearing a lot of people say is optimism but be careful. I mean, you have to be optimistic. If you're going to go into a negotiation you don't want to walk in there with failure on top of your head and say well, it didn't work in the past. You have to be somewhat optimistic if you're going to have a negotiation with another individual or another country.",2.0
against," So, let's face the facts. We're dealing with the Trump administration, so you want him -- them to have optimism. We're talking about John Bolton as the national security advisor, okay? you want them to have optimistic thinking that they are going to get complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearization and then they don't get that and then what's going to happen? I think it's better to temper their expectations, so this thing does not blow up in our face. And part of the reason we have focused the debate the way we have today is that this definition for denuclearization complete verifiable and irreversible is precisely the definition that the Trump administration is using. And using most sincerely. It was reiterated today by former CIA director now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling not only for the complete disarmament of North Korea's nuclear arsenal, but it's chemical and biological arsenal as well. The complete dismantlement of all of its WMD program and our concern is that if we go into a negotiation with this as a legitimate objective and the Trump administration feels burned, that it immediately tacks back into thinking about preventive war. Again, with John Bolton as the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now as the secretary of state. That is not the world we want to live in.",2.0
for,"So, I do want to clarify. I'm not arguing for optimism. I'm arguing for pragmatism. And as the saying goes you make peace with your enemies, not with your friends. And no one here is saying by any means Kim Jong Un is an honorable guy as our president said. But I also want to bring to the table that don't forget, Mike Pompeo met Kim Jung Un just a month ago in Pyongyang, rather remarkable and Mike Pompeo has said that he discussed extensively with Kim Jong Un what complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization would be. Pompeo then reported that Kim was prepared to lay out a map to help us achieve it. So here we have our CIA director who's actually heard it from the horse's mouth that he understands with -- what denuclearization is. He's talked to him extensively. I don't understand experts who are saying we should drop the goal of denuclearization, when the North Koreans themselves are saying they're ready to discuss it now. That doesn't make sense to me.",2.0
against,"Professor Moon Jae-in is naive -- I'm sorry. But actually, the Blue House -- there was a blowback with this controversy. This is a Foreign Affairs article that the Blue House has stepped back from because they're like, ""Oh, no. They got -- he's a little bit too ahead of this."" So, that's my opinion on that. I just wanted to reiterate, the North Koreans have not -- No. It's not naivete. But Professor Moon is free front -- forward in this enough so that the Blue House had to walk back -- -- saying, ""You know, we're -- this is not our perspective. This is Professor Moon's perspective."" They really actually went out and said this today and yesterday. So, I'm just pointing that out. And I just want to point it out that North Koreans have never said they're going to unilaterally disarm North Korea. They talked about, again, the Korean Peninsula -- commitment to denuclearized Korean Peninsula, continually involving South Korea. Now, I have no problem with engagement and negotiation, and I in fact truly believe that Trump, Kim Jong Un's summit will be successful -- because both parties have an incentive to make sure that this meeting goes well. But again, the point is, afterwards, what would happen after this initial meeting? Will it lead to this complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearization is what we're talking about?",2.0
for," So, believe me, I'm not saying that this is going to happen overnight, denuclearization. Even under the best circumstances. What I'm saying is I think a process could be put in place that could lead to that eventual goal. A lot of things would happen before we get there. And it'd have to be action-for-action along the way, because there is so much mistrust. For example, right now, the North Koreans have stopped testing their weapons. The next thing should be that we -- they stop testing the -- they stop advancing their weapons. And that would include verification, and so forth. So, I think, you know, if Kim Jong Un is indeed not serious, we'll know soon enough, right? Because once we get to that stage, if he doesn't let inspectors in, we'll know. If he does, we won't. What I don't understand is, why would Kim take this risk right now? He has this nuclear program. He has an ICBM that theoretically can hit where we're sitting right now. He could just hunker down, sit there in Pyongyang, and continue life as it is, without any backlash. So, something is motivating him. And I think they have made the calculation that without some drastic changes in their economic conditions, that regime will fall. It is the ultimate bargaining chip. And again, it would be a process. A lot of things would have to happen. Security guarantees would be chief among them. And of course, that would have to -- -- include Beijing. But a nuclear weapons program will not feed Korean people. It will not keep the economy up and running. These are things that he has to think about. So, I think it makes total sense now that he has this ultimate bargaining chip. He has this -- I mean, his negotiating position is peak right now. He can come to the table with confidence and for the North Koreans one of the most important things for them is to be able to come to the table and say we are coming here as an equal. We are coming here on equal footing. That's very important to their psychology. I mean, well, -- I mean, I don't really understand how that is going to be a problem in terms of whether we can reach agreement on denuclearization. I mean, I'm still not understanding why that is a threat, or why that's a problem. So, I need to have that more -- better clarified because it's not -- Yes, yes.",2.0
against,"Well, to your point and Suzanne's point, there will be a deal. I mean, North Koreans are coming in from what they think is a position of strength. We think it's because of maximum pressure, but they're coming in. They were offered a deal. So, we're not saying there is not going to be a deal. They could even offer a deal intercontinental ballistic missile because Trump thinking walk away from this and any sort of deal that's going to be good for America. Like, look what I was able to accomplish and no other predecessor was able to accomplish. I protected our homeland even though he does nothing to protect Japan or South Korea, our allies. So, what we are saying is not that -- yes, North Korean leaders coming in from position of equal strength because he thinks he completed the program and he's going to offer a deal, but that's not a full irreversible, complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as we defined it and that's what we --",2.0
for," We don't know that and the fact is is we're at the beginning of a -- we haven't even started the negotiation. What Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Kim discussed is very interesting to me. It seems to me that they've agreed to some extent on what is going to be on the agenda. And again, I want to come back to this question why would Kim take this risk now if he wasn't ready to move forward at least on a process? If things fail, you can imagine it would strengthen the hands of people who were calling for military strikes against North Korea. So, it's not just the economic incentive. It's also the real possibility of military strikes against North Korea is motivating him.",2.0
against,"So, I just want to weigh in on this question of why now and why under the type of pressure that Kim has been facing. In addition to the fact that he has faced the very real threat of military strikes, he now also faces the possibility of being able to enter negotiations and drag them out. So, this is part of the reason why we are suggesting that denuclearization is not a feasible goal. If he comes back to the negotiating table, makes modest, very minor concessions, holds out denuclearization as a pipe dream goal that he never intends to make good on, he can reduce the risk of war to him and begin to get economic benefits without ever making good on that promise.  And that's what history would suggest.",2.0
for,"Well, just a couple of things. You have to keep in mind that this is not going to be a negotiation that's going to happen overnight. When you're saying he's going to drag it out, keep in mind that this is going to take a while. I mean, the Iran agreement took over 20 months.  And this is not going to be something that's -- that Trump's going to go there, they're going to make an agreement, he's -- and they're going to go home. This is going to take a while, regardless. So, I think it's very important that people understand that, you know, it's going to be a process that's going to take time. And we can't really, at this point, predict that that's going to happen. I think we -- -- we're at -- we're not at that point that we can say that that's the -- that that's specifically going to happen. You can't make that assumption at this point. We don't have a crystal ball -- You know, we don't -- -- to that. We don't have enough to say -- I mean, you're basing all your arguments on what has happened in the past. And I understand why you would do that. But in the world of negotiation, and of diplomacy, it's about meeting with the other people. It's about having negotiations and trying to find a resolution. You don't say -- even -- you're not going to say, ""We're not going to have a discussion with you at all,"" when he obviously has come forward and said that he wants complete denuclearization.",2.0
against,"Again, we're not saying -- -- we're not going to have a discussion. We are -- I'm for engagement. I'm for dialogue. We are going to have a discussion. We can't even have -- I think I have a little bit of -- like Mira said, you know, he's going to a little -- he could even ask for a grand bargain. Normalization for denuclearization, grand things like peace treaty. And we also talked about what peace treaty means -- right, getting U.S. forces eventually off the Korean Peninsula, and ending U.S.-South Korea . But I do think one important issue has not come up, which is verification. It came up a little bit. It's really impossible to verify. Right now, I work in the intelligence community. I worked at the CIA for 10 years. And I'm going to tell you, we don't know how many weapons they have, and we don't know where they are. They have so many covert facilities and thousands and thousands of under tunnels -- underground tunnels. And it's going to be hard to even verify. So, this is why I'm saying, again, the definition, complete, verify, irreversible -- has been used by Pompeo today. And that is what we are saying is unrealistic, and he --",2.0

You have to have the discussions and you have to have the people in there. And you don't have that right now. And that's one thing that you have --",2.0
against,"John, I just want to -- -- weigh in here, because this is an essential point. We, in our opening statements, called for negotiations. We called for arms control, and inspectors in North Korea, and getting our arms around these programs. We are responding to the motion as constructed, which is ""Can we denuclearize North Korea?"" And it is to denuclearization that we are saying no. Everything else --",2.0
for,But the North Koreans themselves --,2.0
against,"Talks, arms control, yes.",2.0
for,"-- are saying they're ready to discuss it. What negotiator would go into a negotiating -- any negotiation and step back from the position that the North Koreans themselves are saying they're ready to discuss? Of course, we're going to go in there with -- -- our absolute maximalist position. You'd be crazy not to. So, what I'm saying is the United States has done a very poor job over these years of reading the North Koreans. A lot of times you just read what they say. You hear what their pronouncements are and you can understand what they're trying to do. All I'm saying is, any good negotiator is going to go into this like a tiger, see that the North Koreans -- Kim Jong Un himself discussed it with our Secretary of State. Why would we go in there and give that up? It doesn't make any sense to me. And just very briefly -- I mean, I -- it's -- if you're going to argue that it's okay to have inspectors, and you're going to do that, you're going have the negotiation, have inspectors -- then is that -- that's part of the process of denuclearization. You want to have inspectors in there so you're kind of having it, and you're also not having it. And I also want to go back on my optimism point. It's -- I called it -- Yeah. It's cautious. The word that you've been hearing everyone say is cautious optimism, which means -- -- to be optimistic but be cautious, because there is a history of working with the country. So, you don't go in there blind and say, ""Oh, we're real happy. Everything is going to go great."" You go in there but you be cautious and you be careful about what you do and what you say because you know there's a history.",2.0
against,"So, there's no question -- -- yeah. There is no question that any agreement that we come to, whether it's arms control as we're arguing, or the big lofty denuclearization goal requires other countries that are not just the United States. South Korea essential. China essential. Japan essential. And ultimately if we put in place an arms control regime, that will rely on the international community and international agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency to do those inspections. But there's another side to this international coin, right? Which is to realize that every country that sees itself as having a deep interest in the North Korean nuclear issue has already staked out its bargaining position. So one example of this is China. Not going to be represented at the Trump/Kim summit in just a few weeks, but certainly made its feelings known to Kim Jong Un when he visited Beijing a few weeks ago. And in response to Kim Jong Un's visit to Beijing, the Chinese have already promised to begin letting guest workers from North Korea back into China. That is before Kim Jong Un has done anything. The Chinese have already begun to grant him economic relief. So part of what we're calling here -- for here is realistic goals that all of these international actors can get behind because if we leave the goal too lofty then everybody gets to define it for themselves and move the levers of pressure and incentives as they see fit as opposed to in relationship to something tangible that we can all agree to definitively.",2.0
for,"I'm glad you raised this question because I really want to give special attention to South Korea. We would not be here without President Moon Ji Yin and his deft diplomacy. I think we must give him a great deal of credit. He read the situation well and he offered an attractive off-ramp to Kim Jong Un, the Pyongchang Olympics and inter-Korean dialogue. So, Kim Jong Un told Moon that it was ready to step back from one of its -- one obstacle to past negotiations and that was the North Korean insistence that the U.S. remove their troops. The North Koreans are now saying they won't insist on that. That's a major positive sign. He also told Moon that they do not expect economic sanctions to be lifted immediately. They understand it's a process and we have control over it. Unless and until they do verifiable steps towards denuclearization we don’t have to do a thing. Why do we have to lift a single sanction? This isn't child's play. This is something that professionals do. People who work in negotiation, people who work in verification. This is not something we have to give away before we get to the table and certainly without it being verified.",2.0
against,"Oh, of course they have a conventional power. There's 14,000 conventional tubes that are zeroed in within 60 seconds of Seoul. That's why I said, you know, the preventive war would've been catastrophic. But so, does South Korea. South Korea is also conventional power. North Korea basically lost in terms of rivalry with South Korea on every possible thing, the nuclear weapons is the only thing they really have over South Korea. If I understand your question until North Korea had a reliable nuclear deterrent, U.S. military planners assessed that the United States and South Korea would win any war with North Korea.",2.0
for,"But what's interesting is that for the first time the North Koreans have put forward the possibility of discussing a reduction of their conventional forces, too, which is very interesting.

for,"Well, it -- Well, great question. And in the past, when the North Koreans have talked about denuclearization, this is exactly what they meant.  They've had, at times, a very expansive definition. They're not saying that now, because they know it's a non-starter. That's another signal that this could be serious, and another signal why we should take the risk of engaging with them -- it's a small risk -- and try to get what we can out of it. The fact that they're stepping back from demanding we remove our troops, they're stepping back from saying we have to denuclearize too -- all these things -- you know, if they have been saying it, I would be the first to say, ""Look, they're not serious. Let's, you know, cut this off right now. But they're not saying that. They're actually saying the opposite."" And the -- this was -- And no, the U.S. has never -- that's never been an issue, with the U.S. getting rid of its nuclear weapons. Well, because I think they realize that that's probably -- A non-starter. -- not going to happen anytime soon. And that's part of a bigger argument that's part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty itself. So -- Well, I just want to say one more thing. That talking about things that are on the table -- Kim Jong Un did say also that the weapons are not targeting South Korea and the U.S. So, it's very interesting that he said that, so --",2.0

But that is the fact -- that North Korea has always called for the denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula. And that is the language that appeared in the joint statement between North and South Korea just last week. And that when they say the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, they mean the end of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, the removal of American troops from the peninsula, and --",2.0

against,"Well -- -- so, I think our audience is actually asking -- -- about American nuclear -- American denuclearization. So, the denuclearization question, as Bonnie alluded to, is a much broader question, and basically is about the global zero movement, the effort to get to zero nuclear weapons, something that certainly President Obama was committed to, in theory, something we have not seen reiterated as an objective under this administration. So, I would not suggest that's really on the table right now, from an American perspective. But that also requires consideration of several other countries. But when it comes to the question of removing all U.S. troops from the peninsula, the question there comes down to whether we have removed all remaining elements of the North Korean threat. If the United States was to agree to end the alliance with South Korea and remove its 28,000 troops from the peninsula, it could only do that under conditions where it was sure that South Korea was secure. That's not just the denuclearization of North Korea, but that is the inability of North Korea to invade the south conventionally. And an agreement to denuclearize would still not give South Korea that guarantee.",2.0
for,"Let me make my point one more time. The North Koreans -- -- are not demanding the removal of U.S. troops from the peninsula. In fact, they've said the opposite. They accept it. It is our president who seems to be the most interested in removing our troops -- that we've just learned yesterday out of this report -- who seems more interested in doing that than the North Koreans are. Again, let's not make up facts. Let's follow what the North Koreans are saying. Let's bring them to the table. Let's hold them to account by all means, but let's pursue this to the fullest extent. Should I answer that? You know, the -- you know, China's primary goal with North Korea has not been denuclearization. It's been regional stability. Keep that in mind. That's what they're motivated by. They don't want a collapse of North Korea. They don't want refugees flooding their borders and they certainly don't want U.S. troops on their border, which would happen if North Korea collapsed. But the point about China is let's keep things in mind they have done a much better job bringing tougher sanctions against North Korea and enforcing those sanctions, not perfect. That's one of the reasons why we're at this point, because the sanctions are binding. And secondly, in the resolution of this issue, China is going to play one of the key roles because in terms of security guarantees who do you think is going to be the guarantor for North Korean security? It's going to be Beijing.  I think at the end of the day the Chinese would like to see the -- this problem go away. They don't want to see North Korea go away. They don't necessarily want to see Kim Jong Un go away because that is the buffer between us and them. So, they would like to see that Kim Jong Un stay, but tensions reduced. And certainly, if Kim Jong Un gets rid of their nuclear program I think China would step up to the plate and be a guarantor for their security.",2.0
against," I think you could also make a very clear opposing argument, which is that exactly as Suzanne said the Chinese have always been more interested in stability on the Korean peninsula than in denuclearization. And under severe stress from the Trump administration they have put more pressure on North Korea this year. They have put more sanctions in place and those have started to bite somewhat, but that what they're looking for next is to be in a position where they can start to take some of that pressure off. And they've actually started to do that already.",2.0
for,"But they won't do that because they will then fear we'll move back to the threat of military -- U.S. military strikes, pre-emptive strikes on North Korea and that is the last thing the Chinese want.",2.0
against,They've literally started to do it already.,2.0
for,"That's one of the reasons they've stepped up to the plate with sanctions. And I'm also not sure how far China wants to get ahead of the process. I mean, I think -- I mean, they had the meeting and that was good, but there -- I don't know how far ahead they want to get in the negotiation and what's going to happen with the U.S. and North Korea. I mean, you're kind of making the case that they're already giving things and North Korea hasn't done anything yet, but you know, I'm not sure how far they want to get ahead of the process. I think -- -- the incentives, of course, are all what I've mentioned -- the security guarantees, peace treaty, normalization, bringing North Korea into the -- in front the cold, the economic part. The liabilities I see -- and I'm going to be very frank -- is, I think, our administration, our decimated State Department. Can we actually carry out such complex negotiations? Hopefully Mr. Pompeo -- -- will build up, bring back the swagger, as he says. You know, and I have to say it. I think the North Koreans see an opportunity in Donald Trump. They see someone who's very, very eager to cut a deal. They see someone who's wavered on alliances. Look at NATO. They see someone who doesn't give a hoot about human rights, so they don't expect any lectures there. So, maybe in their mind, of all the things I've said, they also say, ""Hey, this is the U.S. president for us. Let's do this.""  I'm saying they want to do a deal with this president. When I was in Pyongyang in February 2017, he was in office three weeks. They brought up the idea of a summit at that point. They've been thinking about this for a long time, and they've been planning it.",2.0
against,"I agree with everything -- -- Suzanne said. North Korea has been thinking about this for a very long time. They are not -- they have completed their program and they're now walking to this meeting thinking they are in a position of strength, and they're going to play Trump administration.

But I'll underscore strength on the U.S. side, which is the fact that for all that our State Department has been decimated and is understaffed, we still do have extraordinary civil servants staffing our back channel and trying to staff this summit -- -- to prepare as best as they possibly under otherwise very adverse circumstances.",2.0
for,"Well, I hope that you all enjoyed the debate. And I just want to say, one thing I didn't talk about is I have spent 22 years in the military. I was in the Navy -- I mean, the Air Force, and I switched to the Navy Reserves. And during my time in the Navy, I did one of those exercises. I went to South Korea and I did one of the military exercises with them, one of the exercises that North Korea is so concerned about. It was a great experience. I met a lot of really great South Koreans, made some very good friends. And it was a really big exercise, with all the branches of the U.S. and the Soviet -- and the Soviet -- and South Korean military involved. But I will say that despite the fun that we had and the friends that we made, none of us wants that to be a reality. None of us wanted to say that this is actually something that we really have to be worried about, and that we really -- everything that we're practicing, that we really have to do. So, we should be doing everything possible to try to bring peace to the region. We should do everything possible to negotiate whenever we have a chance, to take every opportunity to try to find a way to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, and to find a way that we can reduce the tensions so that we don't have to worry about a nuclear exchange or any other kind of war on the peninsula.

So, their lifelong wish was to see their separated parents and siblings and see unification and peace on the Korean peninsula. Unfortunately, both of them passed away without seeing either. We're asking you to vote for our side of the motion not because we don't fervently hope for peaceful solution in the Korean peninsula, but exactly because we do. Now Suzanne said we need to pay attention to what North Koreans are saying and what we need to read what they're saying so I actually brought something to read. So, because too often we debate U.S. policy towards North Korea, based on what we wish it to be rather than reality of the situation. In the New Year’s editorial address, which launched all this diplomacy and summitry, Kim Jong Un said, ""U.S. will not dare to invade us because we currently have a powerful nuclear deterrent."" Just two weeks ago Kim stated during the preliminary session of the Korean workers' party that ""North has completed nuclear arsenal as a firm guarantee. The North Koreans worked hard with their belt tightened to acquire a powerful treasured sword for defending peace."" So, does this completion of perfection of nuclear arsenal as a firm guarantee for the security or wellbeing of prosperity sound like a prelude to unilateral disarmament of North Korea? This is what we're talking because again, North Korea has a different definition of denuclearization. Does it sound like, because she said we should read to what North Koreans have been saying? This is what he said two weeks ago. Does it sound like a leader who's ready to give up completely irreversibly his nuclear weapons program? We do need to hear what the North Koreans are telling us. We are urging you to vote against this motion today because falsely raised expectation is actually more dangerous and more risky and not good ultimately for the peace of the Korean peninsula.",3.0
for,"So, thank you for your great questions and attention tonight. Over the course of my career I've spent many hours sitting across the table from what -- from those many would call adversaries and one of the things I've learned from this experience is that thing -- unexpected things happen when you're face to face. Suddenly preconceptions, what's happened in the past, assumptions fly out the window and you really never know until you get there. So, one of the greatest lessons I've learned through my work is that even though we live in the 21st Century, the internet age, nothing can take the place of that face to face dialogue and we haven't had that with North Korea for a very long time and the fact that we came so close to a war perhaps a nuclear war just months ago, means it's time to get it started again. So, this is not a case where President Trump is going to sign an executive order and with the stroke of his pen make this happen. This is going to be a process, as I've said. So, we need to be pragmatic. I think at the end of the day what it's going to come down to is whether or not we can change the nature of our relationship with North Korea and anyone engaged in diplomacy knows how hard it is to do that with an adversary. Look at our situation with Iran today. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. And I'd like to end with a quote by a great diplomat and friend, actually someone told me at the end of the debate if you ever want to win quote the great diplomat Richard Holbrook. And come to think of it, I think it was Richard Holbrook who told me that. Great diplomat and risk taker. He understood taking a smart risk to get peace. So, he said, ""I think history is continuous. It doesn't begin or end on Pearl Harbor Day or the day Lyndon Johnson withdraws from the presidency, or on 9/11. You have to learn from the past but not be imprisoned by it. You need to take counsel of history, but never be imprisoned by it. U.S. -- unquote. U.S.-Korean relations over the decades has been riddled with missed opportunities, with failed attempts to make peace. We can, and we should learn from these past mistakes. Our opponents have raised the fact that we haven't been able to do this in the past as the reason we shouldn't do it now. That makes no sense to me. In fact, it makes me more revved up to get this done. And I think the opportunity is too big before us. So, please -- -- for this motion.",3.0
against,"""Desiring to eliminate the danger of nuclear war through denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and thus to create an environment favorable for peace, and peaceful unification of our country, North and South Korea declare that they shall not test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons."" Was this the declaration from last week's summit between North and South Korea, you might suppose?  It is the text of the 1992 agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, signed by North Korea while it was in the midst of launching the nuclear weapons program it has now completed, nearly all of these promises made with the intent of breaking them. We have been down this road before. We believe that some deal with North Korea may be possible. But we also know that denuclearization has never been further from sight. Have our opponents persuaded you tonight that there is a specific deal that will cause Kim to disarm completely at the negotiating table? They've certainly argued that there are talks that could be productive, and we agree. We agreed with that when we entered this room. But we don't agree that those talks will make him give up his entire hard-won nuclear arsenal, and that is what denuclearization is. That's what we've been debating here tonight, and we don't think they've met this burden. Don't be fooled into buying what's not for sale. A vote for this motion tonight is a vote for the same policy we've been pursuing towards North Korea's nuclear weapons program for the last 30 years. Join us instead in calling for smart diplomacy that has a fighting chance of making the world safer and more secure through realistic goals. Think through the history we've presented tonight and demand that we do better than we've done in the past. Join us in voting against this motion. I think President Trump is absolutely hoping for that. This is why -- because he can -- so I think he's going to really come out of this meeting and he's desperate for some sort of a win because he can say this is my foreign policy success. No other predecessor from Clinton to Bush to Obama could accomplish something and look what I was able to accomplish running into -- going into November election. So, I don't know if it will actually have an impact, but I know that this is probably what the President Trump is hoping for.",3.0
for,"I have two answers to that. One is -- I mean, they're already talking about the Nobel Peace Prize. So apparently there's thinking that this is going to somehow make him eligible for the Nobel Peace Prize. So, I think that in itself is going to make him want to have success whatever it might be to get the prize. But the other thing is that unfortunately a lot of these issues don't always resonate during elections and a lot of these issues of nuclear weapons don't resonate in terms of voting. Americans tend to focus mostly on domestic issues. Mostly on issues that are closer at hand. That they can actually see and taste. And this matters to us in Washington and it may matter to people on university campuses who are studying the issue, but when it comes to elections and people going to vote it's not really what people focus on unfortunately. I think I agree with Bonnie on that point. I think if the summit is a success and it gets us on a sustained path towards negotiations, it will have an effect domestically, but not in the political sense. When I think of what happened in Hawaii just a few months ago when people got a text that a missile was incoming, everyone assumed it was North Korea. You know, my hearts really went out for them and I felt terrible about that. I think if this summit is a success and we get down that road the prospect of that happening, people's fears about that, the prospect of a nuclear war diminishes greatly. And that is something we should all hope for and work toward.",3.0

And there is another crucial decision coming up this month that we did not get to talk about during this debate -- that is, the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. If the president scores, essentially, a cheap win with North Korea but simultaneously dismantles a real deal that was keeping another nuclear program in the box, this will not burnish his legacy.",3.0
