against,"I want to start by talking about the first time that I rode in a self-driving car, which was back in 2007. I was writing a story about the grand challenge, the DARPA Grand Challenge, and I heard about these kids who were building a self-driving car to drive it through the desert and I thought oh, that sounds like a fantastic story, and so I went to ride in it. I got into the car, and I thought I was going to vomit. I thought I was going to die, and then I thought I was going to do both at the same time. So, what the car did was it was in an empty parking lot at a Boeing plant in south Philadelphia and the car had to steer on a big curve through the parking lot and it headed straight at a giant cement pilon and it failed to detect this giant cement pilon and we almost ran into it, inches away from running into it. And it did not inspire confidence in me. And so in 2007, I thought oh well, you know, this sounds nifty, but these engineers are saying oh, it's not going to be available, this technology, for five years and I thought ah, I don't know if it's ever going to be and I kind of forgot about it. So, fast forward in 2016, when I started hearing again that self-driving cars are five years in the future and I wondered, did they actually fix all of the problems that I observed in 2007? And the answer is no. And in fact, advocates for self-driving cars have been saying that they're coming soon since at least 1991. With all of these delays and with all of these futures that have failed to materialize, I think it's time to ask will self-driving cars ever work? I started my career as a computer scientist and then I quit to become a journalist. And I have a new book out called, ""Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World."" It's about the inner workings and the outer limits of technology. So, I've spent the past couple of years thinking about why there's a really big gap between what people imagine technology can do and what technology can actually do. And so, the self-driving car is a really good place to examine the gap between imagination and reality. There are a lot of misconceptions around artificial intelligence. A really easy definition that I like to use is that artificial intelligence is a sub-field of computer science the same way that algebra is a sub-field of mathematics. And inside artificial intelligence we have other sub-fields like machine learning and buzzwords like neural networks. There's a little linguistic confusion around these terms because when you say artificial intelligence, you say machine learning, it sounds like there's a little brain in the computer, right? And it kind of triggers all of our Hollywood imagination. And so, this confusion extends to self-driving cars. When we think about the artificial intelligence inside self-driving cars, people kind of assume that the car is thinking. It's not thinking. It's sub-routines. It's computing, which is a really important distinction. And the AI inside autonomous vehicles is very, very impressive. It is an amazing feat of engineering. It is not safe, but it is extremely impressive. So, let's look at one of the ways that the artificial intelligence fails. The thing that the car needs to do when it comes up to say a stop sign is it needs to take in sensor information from the world, identify that there's a stop sign, and then trigger sub-routine to slowly come to a halt at the line in front of the stop sign. And the problem is that the image recognition algorithms that are inside the car are very brittle. They're very easy to defeat. So, if I were to do something simple like take a sparkly unicorn sticker and put it in to the stop sign, then the car would fail to recognize the stop sign as a stop sign and would go through the intersection and cause an accident. Another thing that engineers are not talking enough about is the environment inside a self-driving car. Think about the way that harassment works inside ride share vehicles now. We know that women are routinely harassed inside ride share vehicles by other passengers and one of the reasons that I personally appreciate public transportation is that there is a train conductor, there is a bus driver. There's somebody with moral authority that is recognized inside that space. So, if we take away the bus driver, we take away the moral authority, we take away a degree of safety and I don't know that that's something that we want to do as a society. I'm also going to ask a provocative question. I talked to a lot of taxi drivers and what they said across the board was that people are kind of gross in taxis. Who will clean them? Lots of people get car sick. Think about that.",
for,"The last 15 years this has been my life. I was there in the desert the first year when we were challenged to drive 150 miles across the desert and that year, we drove seven and then basically burst into flames. And so, you know, no we weren't quite ready yet, but a year and a half we -- later we came back, and we had six vehicles finish the challenge that year. And so, we got on our soapbox and we said, this technology is coming. It's getting better faster. We then had the third grand challenge and this time the idea was to drive around an abandoned air base and some brave souls, some stunt drivers actually, got in vehicles and interacted with the cars on the road that day and they were moving around and creating traffic and after 60 miles five vehicles finished. Now, it wasn't without excitement. One big truck drove into a building. You know, two other cars bumped into each other. But this was more than a decade ago. And this technology is advancing rapidly since then. For me, I've seen the first time that a blind man rode in a self-driving car by himself through a city. I've also seen the first time the police pulled over a self-driving car, and, you know, the need for us to explain what's happening with the technology and the community, and that's why I'm here today. And let's talk about safety first. Worldwide 1.3 million people die on our roads. About 40,000 people die on America's roads every year. That's the equivalent of four 738 Max 8s falling out of the sky every. Where's the outrage? The status quo is incredibly broken, and we have the opportunity to do something about this. The good news is that 96 percent of these accidents are due to human error, people making mistakes behind the wheel. And the reason why we have these accidents is due to a combination of people drinking, being distracted, and being tired. We need to find a way to bring another solution to bear and in this case the solution is tantalizingly close and that is self-driving, driverless vehicles. But let's ask the question why do people do these things in the car. Fundamentally, people are really bad at estimating risk and their ability. You know, it turns out that more than 80 percent of Americans believe they are above-average drivers, so think about that for a moment. And then the second is that time is precious.  And so, when we have the opportunity to pull a cellphone from our pocket and indulge in something fun in the midst of the tedium of driving, we do so, and at great risk to ourselves and the public. There’s a very human cost to this, and there’s a huge economic cost as well. It turns out the average American commutes about 55 minutes a day; there’s about 128 million people who do that. If you multiply that by the average hourly wage in the U.S., which I looked up today -- it’s about $28 -- that means we are spending $3 billion a day to have the privilege of commuting. Anyone who says they like driving doesn’t enjoy commuting, and we can fix that for them. Imagine those people coming home at the end of the day, instead of cursing about the experience they just had, having had the chance to use that time productively or had the chance to read a book or relax or engage in a debate. Really, the argument shouldn’t be “Do we hail the driverless car?” It’s “Do we really accept the cost and the loss of life, accept it with the status quo?” And if we don’t, then this is the technology to deliver that.",
against,"Let’s say we could get the technology to be perfect. Who stands to benefit the most from driverless technology? Who is dying on America’s roads? If we look at road fatalities over the last 20 or 30 years, there has, in fact, been a drop, in terms of the volume of people that are dying on the roads. But it turns out that that drop has not been uniformly shared across the socioeconomic spectrum. Sam Harper , a wonderful epidemiologist at McGill, has done some work on this, and what he has found is truly worrying. If you are an American with a college degree or higher, the chances of you dying on the road has gone down over the last three decades, but if you have less than a college degree, the chances of you dying on America’s roads has actually gone up. And one reason why is because less educated people generally tend to make more money -- less money, excuse me -- and as a consequence of that they are more likely to own older vehicles that lack advanced safety features, things like rear-facing cameras, blind spot detectors, automated braking. Put simply, if there is one group of Americans that stands to benefit from driverless car technology, it’s poor people, which raises a very interesting question: can poor people actually afford it? And we’ve crunched the numbers, and what we have found is that they cannot. In fact, on a per-mile basis, riding in a driverless taxi would be at least three times higher than owning an older vehicle today -- three times higher. This raises a very interesting question. While driverless car technology may, in fact, have the potential to improve public health, to save lives, whose lives are we actually saving?",
for,"Defend “tantalizing?” It’s a good word. I was thinking it was on the SATs. So, I think you will see within the next five years small-scale deployments of this technology. My former team at Google has deployed vehicles where they were driving around with no operator in them. They’re not yet ready for full-scale deployments, and they’re doing the right thing and being very safe and thoughtful in that deployment. But we can see this technology on the road; our team engages with it every day. And I think probably one of the strong points is just the amount of economic investment in the space. Some very smart people are in investing significant dollars behind this technology to push it forward.",2.0
against,"I actually used to believe that the self-driving cars were close, and then I went in, and I read the code, and I read the training data. I looked at the training data, and I realized that a lot of the kind of everyday issues that we cope with as drivers are not represented in the training data and are not accounted for in the code. So, I think about weird things that happen when you’re driving. So, my personal weirdest thing that ever happened while I was driving was, I was going down a twisty road in Vermont, and all of a sudden, there was a moose just standing in the middle of the road, just looking at me. And I thought, “Wow.” It never before occurred to me that I was going to have to reckon with a moose when I was driving. And so, I could very quickly update my mental model that, oh, yes, there are going to be moose in Vermont, and there are going to be large mammals that I’m going to have to navigate around as a driver.",2.0
for,"This is the thing that I actually do know a little bit about. So, well, being Canadian, we’re familiar with meese -- -- and working in this space. So, I think that this longtail argument for rare events -- I think there are two ways that I think about that as maybe not as big a deal as others do. One is when you have teams of people that have been working on this for a decade, we’ve thought pretty hard about this stuff. The idea that an animal might be on the road is not totally surprising concept, particularly if you look at safety statistics. The other thing that I would think about is that, really, a lot of those rare events -- what it boils down to is not hitting the thing.  You know, it might look like a moose; it might look like a tree, it might look like a sparkly unicorn. You know, it might look like any of these things, but at the end of the day, the goal is don’t hit the stuff in the road. And so, a lot of that really boils down to something relatively straightforward.",2.0
against,"I really am, I really am, because -- I mean, one of the things that I really like that Chris has said in the past is, Chris, you have a YouTube video, where you talk about weird stuff that has been observed by the Google cars, and so there’s a clip where you’re talking about a woman in a wheelchair chasing a duck -- -- around the street. And I thought, “Wow, that is a really great example of something that I never would have imagined that I needed to write code against if I were programming this car.” But the category of things that happen in the world that you can’t write code against is actually -- you know, is really vast, and so you have cases like in Australia when the cars malfunction when faced with kangaroos.  Because, like, yes, we can absolutely program against moose. Like, we can program against North American land mammals, and we can program against, you know, North American birds, but then we get to Australia, and we’re into the kangaroos, and they’re totally different. And so, humans are really flexible -- we can update our mental models very quickly and easily -- and these kinds of things are not easy to update in code. They’re actually very expensive.",2.0
for,"Yeah, sure. So, I think this debate is speaking to the difficulty sometimes in seeing the future even if as we’re at the cusp of it. And this recalls to mind the journalist named Clifford Stoll, who’s a very respected columnist, but his career will forever be remembered by one unfortunate article that he wrote in 1995, where he said the internet is going to fizzle out and be completely meaningless. I think it had such beautiful lines in it like, “Well, if ecommerce is going to be anything, how come I -- my mall does more business in the afternoon than the entire internet does in a month? Who wants to read a newspaper on the computer?” Now, in his defense, it’s always hard to see these things in foresight; hindsight is 20/20. I really think that in 10 years from now, when we look back on this, or in 10, 15 years, when this is mainstream, we’re going to look back and think that it was obvious going forward. And it’s being driven by very fundamental advances in tech. The same amount of computation that cost a couple pennies today cost $1,000 in 2,000 and a $1 billion in 1970. And so, that’s why when we talk about image recognition -- even since the Google self-driving car project has started, on the annual competition where teams test their cutting-edge vision algorithms, their error rates have improved by a factor of 10 just over that time. Technologies are tools, and they give us tools to solve problems that weren’t solved before.",2.0
against,"As a fellow Canadian, I certainly appreciate the importance of dealing with meese. That said, I just want to go to Chris’s point earlier, where you talked about tremendous investment in the space. I think there was a Brookings Report in which they were talking about something on the order of about $80 billion. This is a bit of a comeback, but what I would say is just because people are willing to invest in an enterprise, doesn’t mean the enterprise makes sense, and I think Theranos is a very, very good example of this. Now, in regard to self-driving -- Essentially, a biopharmaceutical company out in California that, for lack of a better word, was --",2.0

against,"Yeah, fair enough. Now, on the point regarding we can, get the costs down -- I cannot dispute Amitai’s point. If we think about the first cellphone, for example, looked a little bit like a brick. And I think at that time a cellphone sold for about $4,000; in today’s dollars that would be about $9,000, and I doubt very much most of you have paid $9,000 for your cellphone. Well, some of you might have.  It is true that as technology gets better, and as production volume increases, we can get the price down, but that’s not really the comparison. The question isn’t “Can we get the price to be lower?” The question is “Can we get the price to drop so that it is competitive with what poor people and, indeed, regular people own today?” And I, to date at least, have not seen any data that suggests you can get this technology to be cost-competitive with personal vehicle ownership.",2.0
for,"There is actually a readymade audience that would enormously benefit from self-driving technologies, especially if it comes out as most technology -- as most people in the field believe: in shared fleets like Uber and Lyft. Two income groups that use taxis the most: the richest group, as you might expect, who use it for convenience, and the poorest groups, because they can’t afford to own a car and therefore have to pay for taxis, even though taxes are more expensive. So, those groups will benefit immediately with self-driving cars in a fleet model, and that’s already been borne out of what we’ve seen in Uber and Lyft. Taxis are not available in most zip codes in Los Angeles, and it was a study by University of California-Davis that showed that 99.8 percent of Los Angeles can now get into an Uber or Lyft, and they’re including lower-income populations and black neighborhoods where taxis didn’t want to go. So, that opens possibilities that they didn’t have before.",2.0

for,"I’m sunny . We think about somebody putting a Post-It note on the car, and, you know, we’d certainly prefer it to not drive away rather than kind of faith-based drive off and hope it all works out. We think about security; we think about these failure modes. You know, if I look at the engine of my car, it’s probably worth $1,000 or more. I think the transmission is; I think the tires of my car are probably worth a few hundred dollars. This kind of a thing that exists -- it doesn’t feel like an argument against driving cars; it is more of a discussion around our perception of humanity.",2.0

for," Yeah, so -- Right, so I think it’s terrible that women feel that level of risk, but we didn’t say we’re not going to have elevators because of that. The technology is still incredibly useful and valuable, and the right answer is to not throw the baby out with the bathwater.",2.0
against,"I really have a problem with this term, “driverless,” because it conjures up the image that there is no one overlooking the technology, and this is factually inaccurate. Through the history of mankind, through the history of mankind there has never been a single instance, not one, where safety-critical features have been designated to machines without any human oversight. Driverless, as I often say, does not mean humanless. To your point about the impact on the disabled, the consequences, on the one hand, are good because you have someone watching over that vehicle in case a disabled person, or any person for that matter, has difficulty. But there is a negative externality as well, which is the minute you have an individual watching over a driverless car, that’s a cost. How many driverless cars or driverless cabs should one person watch? Because the only way the economics work is if you leverage economies of density. And I have put this question before to, you know, auto execs, and no one will give me an answer.   It absolutely has the ability to increase mobility for a large swath of Americans; indeed, individuals more broadly. But leveraging that benefit depends, once again, on cost.",2.0
for,"So, looking at the average paratransit ride is $70 or $90, we should be able to do that better than that pretty easily. I think, conceptually, I agree with the point. I think you’re right that there will be some level of oversight. Exactly what the number is -- I could make up something, but it would be meaningless. But the point is that it will not be one operator to one vehicle; it will be one to many. The technology is avoiding bumping into stuff and then at the point where we really need human level intellect to support and kind of unblock the technology, that’s where the people engage, and that’s at a relatively low rate.",2.0
against,"So, I believe you're referring to the trolley problem, which is a classic ethical dilemma -- Yep. I'm going to smash into the tree in order to save the small child because young lives are precious. One of the things that we have to do with self-driving cars is program in decisions around these kinds of issues. People who are making these kinds of decisions are not necessarily the people who are best equipped to make these kinds of social decisions. The engineers who are building the code. Are not necessarily the best equipped. Ethics has not been emphasized for an entire generation of engineers and software developers. And in fact, we didn't start having a robust conversation about AI ethics and data ethics until the past couple of years. And I would also say that there's a kind of bias at work inside the tech community that I call techno-chauvinism. It's the idea that technology is always a superior solution. And I would argue that in something like the ethical realm the human solution is actually superior. It's not actually a competition, and we should think about using the right tool for the task and for driving humans are actually a really good solution.",2.0
for,"Yeah, so I think the premise of that I think is a little unfair, right? It's painting a whole community with one particular brush. So, I guess I just go out -- actually, I talked directly about the heart of the trolley problem. So first, there is no right answer.  This is not something like mathematics where there, you know, one plus one equals two. This is something where the right answer is really a function of our society and our values and which life do we hold more precious or not, the government ultimately will have a voice and in the interim we have to do our best to deal with these incredibly rare events. The other part of the question, though, is a little flawed in that, you know, the answer is well, of course I would swerve into the tree to avoid the child in the road. The problem is that in the instant that you have to make that decision we have done studies; reasoning does not get to that level. So, are you arguing we shouldn't worry about this?",2.0
against,"My point is that this is a misnomer. It's a nice academic exercise to engage in, but no regulator would ever sign off on a system that prioritizes one life over another. It has never happened. It will probably never happen.  I also don't want my kid out there in a world where there are two-ton killing machine roving around that are programmed to kill children and save the driver. I mean, I'm not okay with that.",2.0

against,"Well, I'll take Amitai's point. Regarding, you know, driverless cars providing access to disabled people. I wanted to come back on this. Companies aren't developing this technology to provide services to disabled people. They're developing this technology to make money and they will price their product at a rate that allows them to recoup the cost of capital. That's number one. Number two, in regard to the environmental benefits of driverless cars, if you think about a powertrain today, if you think about a vehicle, it's about 55 percent. That number fluctuates a little bit. About 55 percent of a vehicle's fuel economy comes from the engine itself. About 45 percent comes from what we would call ecofriendly driving practices, things like not hitting the gas, you know, when you're running up towards a red light, things like that. As far as I'm concerned unless you can guarantee that driverless cars will be electrified vehicles, which you can't, you absolutely cannot, realizing the environmental benefits of this technology all else being equal is in my view perhaps not necessarily accurate.",2.0
for,"Some of our opponents have suggested that autonomous vehicles either won’t work well, or they may be limited as luxuries, or they’re mainly convenience plays for the rich. Well, history abounds with arguments in advance of new technologies that don’t fully foresee how they’re used, so we don’t fully see the impact before it happens. In the late 1940s, AT&T wanted to start using -- wanted to start deploying a cellphone network. And the government wouldn’t allow it and said, “Cellphones are only going to be for the rich. It’s only going to be for convenience; it’s not really going to work. Instead, what we’d like to do is reserve the spectrum for several thousand new TV stations, because that’s what people need.” Well, there were never several thousand new TV stations, and cellphone networks were not permitted until the early 1980s, and we all know what happened from there. Self-driving cars will change our transportation system, and they will change people’s lives for the better. History shows, though, that compelling technologies can be delayed if the public doesn’t fully understand its potential, and that doesn’t help draw the technology. So, I am encouraged that polls show that already 50 percent of people are very interested in getting into self-driving cars because we cannot afford to wait another 30 years, or delay by 30 years, the safety and accessibility benefits of self-driving technologies. So, let’s not make myopic decisions that don’t reflect what the real potential and excitement of this technology is, so I ask for your vote to hail the self-driving car.",2.0
against,"So, our opponents have spoken very eloquently about the ability of this technology to save lives. Governments agree, investing billions of dollars to give us what we want: the self-driving car. But I propose there is another way. We could, for example, use existing public policies to save lives. We could take a no-tolerance approach to drunk driving, something that has been shown to reduce road fatalities by as much as 18 percent. We could lower speed limits, something that, according to the WHO, has been found to lower road fatalities by as much as 30 percent. We could simply ask people to buckle up, something that has been shown to reduce road felt fatalities by as much as 50 percent. As stewards of the public purse, our commitment should be to what we need, not what we want.",2.0
for,"So, I want to take a moment to talk about someone: Steven Fletcher . He’s the brother of the guy who was the best man at my wedding, the best friend of mine in high school and college. Steven -- Canadian geological engineer -- was driving to a mine in northern Manitoba one morning and hit a moose, he became a quadriplegic. Since then, he has had an incredible career. A cabinet minister in the Canadian government, but every day he is burdened by that challenge of getting from one place to another. So, for someone like Stephen this is the kind of technology we cannot live without, whether it would have saved him on that day, or whether it would give him the freedom today. My oldest son is in the audience today; he’s 15 and a half. Basically, the last time he rode his bicycle for real he rode into a trash can and crashed and broke his wrist. He’s about to get a driver’s license in six months, and he is -- He is a smart, thoughtful, intelligent young man, but if you look at the statistics for people like him, it’s terrifying as a parent. And so, if we can introduce technology that will allow us to not have to have that horrible conversation experience in our lives, that’s profound, profoundly important. Now, the arguments that our opponents have made, and they’ve made them eloquently, are fundamentally that this is hard, that it is hard to build the technology, that it’s going to be hard to build a business around this, that it’s going to be hard to do it right. Well, I would quote John F. Kennedy, that we built the self-driving technology not because it is easy, but because it is hard, because the challenge is one we are willing to accept, and we’re unwilling to postpone. All hail the driverless car.",2.0
against,"I’ve heard the same statistic about safety repeated over and over again. On John Croshik’s LinkedIn page, he had the statistic that 95 percent of traffic accidents are caused by humans, and driverless cars are going to reduce this, and then I saw the same statistic repeated on a National Highway Transportation Safety Administration page. And I looked at who had made that statistic, and it turns out it was a statistic that was created by a government contractor, and that contractor was a subsidiary of an organization that makes unmanned drones for military use for the U.S. government, and this was making the argument for driverless cars. So, we have a government contractor who stands to profit dramatically from the introduction of autonomous vehicles who is concocting the justification that the government is using for implementing self-driving cars. I think that we need to look closely at who is telling us that this is making a safer world, and I think we need to look at what kind of profits are they going to reap from us believing this. Race is a factor in image recognition. Our image recognition systems have a lot of the same blind spots that humans do because humans embed their own biases in the technology, and so we have things like soap dispensers that don’t work for people with darker skin. And this scales up; it scales into facial recognition systems, which are better at recognizing men with light skin. They’re better at recognizing men than they are at recognizing women; they’re better at recognizing people with light skin than they are at recognizing people with darker skin. Who is going to get hit by self-driving cars, and who is going to suffer as a consequence of having these things on the road?",2.0
