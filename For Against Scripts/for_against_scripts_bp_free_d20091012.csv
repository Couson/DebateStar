for,"Well ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you, this is a fascinating topic at this particular moment in American history. And I would’ve thought maybe that people were tired of it by now but I can see that that is obviously not the case. Now as the chairman said, in fact I don’t think this— you can decide that question other than in the context of what it—whether or not you’re going to succeed, other than in the context of what American policy is and what the stated foreign policy of the President of the United States is with regard to this question. That’s— I had the fortune or misfortune to go to any number of Army service schools, one of them was the Army War College, where they taught me a lot about the strategy of planning… itself, you started with the mission, national purpose, you have a policy, and then you devise a strategy from that. then you implement that strategy. That’s how it works. Now, last March I listened carefully when President Obama announced that our policy in Afghanistan was to disrupt, destroy, and disorganize our enemies, our specific enemies who were a danger to the United States. That’s a nice… clear policy, you know, it’s not too hard to understand that. And to that end, General Stanley McChrystal was put in command out there, and sent out to make what is called a commander’s estimate of the situation. Which he did, with a lot of help from various people for several months and it is now as you know, the object of great contention in the Washington world. And the problem with his estimate, I think, that is causing so much trouble, is that it is normal in an estimate of that kind for a commander to propose several options to his superior, among which the boss can choose. To present only one option, in this case the option of a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign, across all of the really hostile parts of Afghanistan in the context of their ruined, if ever alive economy, and their obviously rather feeble political system, is a daunting task. But somehow it has become-- what we would call an implied task for General McChrystal, that the pacification of large parts of Afghanistan and the most hostile places are in fact a necessary thing. And for that reason, he has opted for counterinsurgency. Now, I am happy to see so many members of my generation out here in the audience. There are usually too many young people for my taste. But— I started in the counterinsurgency business —in the church of the counterinsurgents, really. In 1964, if you can believe that, when the Army sent me down to Fort Bragg to study this subject with intensity and at the feet of the most learned French and British exponents of this theory of warfare which had been created as a result of the experience of the former colonial powers in World War II in fighting against the wars of national liberation as they were called then. And the Communists had gotten involved in all these wars so we were against all this as well, so we studied up on this in a big way, and one of the most interesting of the guys who taught from the stage there was a great, a great scholar named Bernard Fall. Bernard Fall. Some of you undoubtedly know who that is. And I remember watching him, I—of course I had no real idea who he was at the time but I remember him, watching him write—write on a blackboard on the stage, “Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.” “Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.” And that’s really all of it right there, that’s all of it in a nutshell. And it is in that context that when you look at Afghanistan, this huge place that’s the size of Texas with 35 million people of very disparate origins, many of them speaking languages that are not mutually intelligible, and who don’t like each other, a lot of them, very much, in fact you can see, that this is a very difficult thing to do. We tried applying this theory of warfare, counterinsurgency, across the world in the 1960s and ‘70s and ‘80s and I did it myself in South America, in East Africa and Southwest Asia and all kinds of places, and of course Vietnam, how could I forget that. And we found that in places where the task wasn’t too big, you know, the country wasn’t too big, the problems weren’t manageable one way or another, or people weren’t thoroughly converted to some ideology that demanded revolution, that you could do this, by enough good works and suppression of guerillas you could turn this around, and I could name places if we had time. In places that were eerily big and where none of those conditions applied, we—you could struggle like the devil but you wouldn’t get very far, you know. And I—this is the problem I have with the idea of the application of counterinsurgency, those three things, to Afghanistan, I know that was four things. In fact, I think that is too big a task for us. We have been fighting for eight years, Afghanistan is a huge place, it has terrible problems, economic ones, political ones. And the combat problem, from the point of view of a guy who fought in several wars like this including Vietnam, is really very difficult. And I would submit to you that if what we’re going to do as General McChrystal says, we’re going to try to protect the people, which means essentially, control the population because that’s what counterinsurgency is about, just like insurgency is about controlling the population either with positive means, or means not so positive, sometimes, you’re going to have to have a lotta troops to do this. I mean General McChrystal evidently wants 40,000 more people. Well I would say to you that that’s just the beginning. That’s how we started in Vietnam too. This is a big problem we’re facing in Afghanistan. And in fact, this slice of the pie will be followed by further slices of the pie. And my objection to all this is, and the reason why I don’t think we can win with a counterinsurgency strategy, is in fact because I think that, three or four years down the pike, if we apply that strategy, all you good people, and your fellow citizens across the country are going to look at this, going to say, are the Taliban, or whatever it is we’re calling the Taliban, are they really our enemies, in the sense that al-Qaeda was? Is this really what we want to do? And when that happens, I suspect that what’s going to happen is you’re going to tell your members of Congress that you’ve had enough of this, and then they will vote the end of the war as they did in Vietnam. So I don’t think we can do this, I don’t think we can do counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, there are other methods that could be applied, that would control the situation there over a long period of time, I don’t think we can withdraw altogether. But counterinsurgency in Afghanistan I find to be a very difficult idea. ",
for,"Thanks— Thank you, while I have a chance to pay tribute to my boss and colleague, Steve Coll, on the blogging front, Steve writes the blog “Think Tank” for The New Yorker, you should go check it out, I hope Steve writes about this. Steve was commended the other day by Senator John McCain at a forum in Washington. John McCain said to everyone go read Ghost Wars, and as it turns out Barack Obama’s been carrying a text of Ghost Wars around for about 11 months. I think it’s the most carried-around book that Obama has had, if he would just finish it we might get somewhere. I also want to take a moment to pay tribute to Kati Marton who’s a member of our board of directors and happens to be married to one Richard Holbrooke. Richard Holbrooke is in my view one of the most tenacious and effective results-deliverers in the global justice community. I put myself somewhat in the realist community, but I don’t—I generally criticize some of the goals of the global justice community, for not being able to set priorities, not being able to set plans, not being able to pursue things to their end. And Richard Holbrooke does do this. My problem, and why I’m on this side of the aisle from my friend and colleague Steve Coll, is that very few people in the Obama administration are like Richard Holbrooke, or can frame the debate in Pakistan and Afghanistan like Steve Coll just did. And this concerns me. If you speak to people of responsibility within an administration, clarity of objectives and how you’re going to get there, the game plan, being not only able to explain to the American public why we’re doing something, but to be able to create internal plans that help you execute consistent direction is vital. And that clarity of direction has not been in place and it wasn’t until the leak of General McChrystal’s report, in my view, that you began to see higher prioritization of the Afghanistan question. That is a lousy way to tell the world that we’re under good management in the United States. A few years ago I was in China. I went to see the equivalent of the policy planning staff in China, said what are you folks working on. And they said how to keep you guys distracted in small Middle Eastern countries. And as we’ve moved from the problems in Iraq, we now have moved to a problem in South Asia, and very often we talk about as Steve Coll did, the drama that envelops the South Asian region, the very important promise the United States has in possibly trying to achieve a new equilibrium there. But let me ask you all a question, how many of you look at China, whether you’re concerned about its security forces or indebtedness, as a major issue for the United States, just raise your quick hand. Okay, how— hands down. How many of you look at in the Middle East, what is unfolding with Iran, Iran’s nuclear intentions, as a significant, really giant hurdle for the United States. How many of you look at Russia, some of you look at Russia and what’s been unfolding in NATO as a major issue. Probably a fewer number, but they’re out there. ",1.0
against,"Thank you, it’s a great pleasure to be here tonight to argue about a subject that I think should concern us all and I’m very pleased that the American people are so closely engaged in this discussion that concerns the safety of the country, the safety of all of us, as well as the fates of many of my friends and I’m sure many of your sons and daughters and friends as well, so, it is well worth the time to invest in thinking hard about these questions and what it is we’re trying to accomplish in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Steve focused on why it is that we should succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and talked to a certain extent about why it is possible for us to do so, that the situation is not as dire as perhaps has been presented. It is my task then to talk about part of the way we can succeed, part of the how. And I’d like to start off if I can by pointing out that, there has been an acceptance so far in this debate of what it is we’re trying to accomplish, of what success means. And success has been defined as a pretty minimal standard. An Afghanistan and a Pakistan that are not ruled by terrorists, a Pakistan that still has security over its nuclear arsenal. I would contend, that if we cannot as a nation achieve that success, if it is impossible for the United States to ensure that Pakistan retains control of its nuclear weapons from terrorists…that that is a very, very dire situation. And that’s why we have invested so much as a nation to date, and why I believe we need to invest even more, because the stakes are so very high, the consequences of failure are potentially so catastrophic. That’s the bad news. The good news is that we can in fact succeed in this endeavor. And this book tells us how. This is the Counterinsurgency Field Manual written under the direction of General Petraeus and General Jim Mattis. For those of you who didn’t bring it along, I’m not going to read the whole thing. But to quote from Chapter 5… the way to conduct a counterinsurgency campaign is to do a number of different things, to do them all well, to coordinate them together. Our opponents say that it is impossible for the United States to help our friends and our allies do this, I would disagree, I would say that it is enormously difficult, but that we have a learning army, a learning State Department, we have adapted and we have developed the capability to do this reasonably well. We have a number of extraordinarily talented people, continuing to try to help our Afghan partners. And they do it by conducting combat operations against our enemies. This is a component of counterinsurgency, this is the counterterrorism part, killing or capturing identified enemies of the government of Pakistan, the government of Afghanistan, and that happens and that will continue to happen, and we are in fact, getting far better at that. Training and equipping host nation security forces is an essential part of a lasting counterinsurgency strategy, and it is essential for us not to have to conduct counterterrorism forever. So, if you want at some point the United States to be able to depart from Afghanistan, then you have to support raising and training Afghan security forces who in time, will be able to secure their country on their own, something we have not done very well to date. We have to provide essential services to the population, water, electricity, most of all security. We have to provide them with good governance, something that, we have not helped with as much as we should. We have to provide them with good economic development and opportunity to have their sons and their daughters earn a decent living, so that they cannot be attracted away by the insurgents, many of the insurgents I fought against in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, many of the Taliban insurgents today, are economic insurgents. That is, there is no other way for them to feed their families, than to take money from the Taliban, in order to conduct attacks against us, against the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. So, for a very few dollars, well-invested, we can peel away the less committed parts of the insurgency, and we can provide them with an economic opportunity. We were able to do this in al-Anbar late in Iraq. The process started early but really came to fruition in late 2006, early 2007, and large numbers of the insurgents turned away from fighting against us, and started fighting on our side against al-Qaeda. We’ve done this before, the same people who made that process happen, who inspired that process in Iraq, are working now to do it in Afghanistan. So you can peel away insurgents and reduce the number of people you’re fighting, gain additional support for your effort. So we have done this successfully in the past, it is not easy by any means, but we have a track record. It is also important to note that Pakistan is now succeeding in its efforts. In March the Pakistani government decided because of extraordinary American pressure, to fight against the insurgents who had taken the Swat River Valley, just 60 miles from the capitol of Pakistan. And in a not very sophisticated but very effective counterinsurgency strategy, they cleared the Taliban out of the Swat River Valley, and the people of the Swat River are now returning home. Pakistan is about to do the same thing in south Waziristan. They are conducting an effective counterinsurgency campaign to relieve the danger to their government, and to make their weapons, and, and, and their country more safe. The most important thing we can do to help them in this effort, is to continue to conduct counterinsurgency on our side of the Durand line in Afghanistan. It will be enormously difficult for us to encourage Pakistan to continue conducting its counterinsurgency campaign, if we decide not to do so in Afghanistan. And the implications of that decision are enormously important. The single most important step we have to take, to build a secure Afghanistan and a secure region, is to raise and train an Afghan army that is sufficiently sized, and sufficiently well-equipped, to secure Afghanistan on its own. In my last job on active duty in the Army, I worked with Afghan soldiers, I trained Afghan soldiers. These are people who are willing to fight for their country. They are disappointed that we have not provided the resources to get enough of them to fight for their country, in order to enable us to begin to depart. Putting more effort into that, is the single most important step I believe, to helping America succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ",1.0
for," Looking out at this crowded house I’m really happy that I’m almost over my swine flu. Ladies and gentlemen. So far this evening, you’ve heard quite a range of opinions. Let’s look at the facts. We have been in Afghanistan for eight years. We have committed enormous amounts of treasure and quite a bit of blood. And eight years on, the Taliban have no trouble attracting volunteers…in fact their numbers are swelling. They are willing to take up primitive arms, and fight against the most powerful military in history, to stand with a Kalashnikov, or to attack a US outpost and stand and fight, despite the helicopters and the aircraft coming in on them, and killing them. And we can’t get the Afghan army to show up.  How much training does it take. Sophisticated weapons? What sophisticated weapons do the Taliban have.  The Taliban are willing to give their lives for their cause. The Afghan army and police are not willing to die for the woefully corrupt and incompetent government of Hamid Karzai. That is simply a fact. Now my Army colleague John Nagl said, well, the Taliban are hiring, they’re economic soldiers. Ladies and gentlemen, you do not sign up to stand against the greatest army in history, and give your life, for the Afghan equivalent of a minimum wage. And we pay better than the Taliban. Why aren’t they lining up, to join the Afghan army and fight? Why do our soldiers and Marines have to go into battle alone? Or, worse, watching over their shoulder to see if the Afghans with them, are going to betray them or shoot them in the back, as has happened repeatedly. This matters. How many Americans should die for the government of Hamid Karzai? And we can—and Steve Coll said, well, you know, we’re going to fix that. When, how?  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the power to stay—and the wealth—to stay in Afghanistan forever. Certainly beyond our lifetimes, if we wish. But strategy is about asking what we get out of it. And is it doable, strategy isn’t about what’s nice to do, it would be nice to turn Afghanistan into Vermont. But it is not going to happen. Because, one thing we cannot do— we can fly in in our helicopters, dismount, arrive in an Afghan village and get the elders to nod their heads, until we leave. We can bribe them for a while, they won’t stay bribed. But we cannot make Afghans want what we want. A brief history. We’ve been in Afghanistan before. We had major development projects, in Helmand Province, down where they’re fighting now, in the 1950s and ‘60s. Nothing came of it. The Soviets, had at their peak 140,000 troops, tens of thousands civilian advisors. Their interagency process worked because they could order people from other departments to go. They have thousands of Dari and Pashtun speakers. They built hundreds of clinics and schools and factories, it’s not like just the bad Soviets killing people in the movies. Their Afghan army was over 300,000 trained with helicopters and tanks. And they lost. Because the people of Afghanistan didn’t want what the Soviets wanted them to want. Now think of this as an investment. We’re investing our blood and treasure. What is the possibility of a positive return, for that investment. For the past 200 years, every foreign investor has lost. Are we truly exceptions to history? Is it worth the gamble? Afghanistan is not a country, it is an accident of where other people’s borders to ended. You cannot nation-build where there is no nation to build. In a tribal society, you work with tribes. Now we may know that it would be wiser for all the tribes to get along. But we do not want what Afghans want. General McChrystal’s report is fascinating. In many respects it’s an objective view. But you know what it leaves out. Religion is barely mentioned. In the Counterinsurgency Manual, religion is barely mentioned. This is even more foolish than trying to deal with the war in Europe in World War II—and ignoring Nazis. Religion may be politically incorrect to talk about. It’s difficult, it makes us uneasy. But to write a 66-page report about the Taliban, and not mention the power of religion and fundamentalist Islam, seems to me that we are living in a dream world.  This debate-- Thank you. This debate, the terms of it make me uncomfortable. Because I’m in the middle. In a world of very strange bedfellows, I find myself aligning with Vice President Joe Biden, or, I’d like to think he’s aligning with me. But the choices aren’t all in or all out. There are rational choices. Ladies and gentlemen, why did we go to Afghanistan in 2001? Because of al-Qaeda. To punish them, to smash them, and to punish those who harbored them. Afghanistan was a low-budget terrorist motel. So the feds raid the motel, kill some of the bad guys, capture some, and others escape. And instead of going after the ones who escaped, we decided to renovate the motel. It… Now, I would just close by saying, I believe there is still a purpose in maintaining a compact, lethal force, focused on destroying our enemies, helping Pakistan to the extent Pakistan deserves the help, but not allowing ourselves to be blackmailed by the Pakistanis, as we have allowed ourselves to do. But at the end of the day, this is about flesh and blood, Afghans of course, and our young men and women in uniform. Now, I am not a pacifist. Wars have to be fought. But let us ensure that they are true wars of necessity, and not wars of inertia, and bad habits. Let’s—when we ask our young men and women in uniform to die…if they must die, let it be for sensible strategy, and attainable goals. Not because, we’re out of ideas.",1.0
against,"To convince you on your second vote, to support this motion, I think the other team has to convince you of either one of two propositions. The first is, that we don’t have any serious interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and therefore we should walk away. Or, they have to convince that we do have interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but they’re too costly to achieve. And therefore, we should walk away. Although I just heard a new one from Steve Clemons who says, well, we may have interests, they may be costly but we can achieve them, but we should walk away perhaps because the President can’t make up his mind. I think that Steve and John together have made a very persuasive case, for the interests that we have—we have, in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. That these interests are not just America’s interests but these are shared by our allies. And that we have the capacity, through the intelligent application of counterinsurgency doctrine, to achieve those. And listen very closely to Ralph Peters’ argument, the smash them and leave argument, I believe, and to still vote for this proposition requires you to go through a kind of a contortion known as remote-control counterterrorism. Remote-control counterterrorism, that’s where, presumably, you track and you deter al-Qaeda from offshore, maybe with precision munitions, maybe from satellites, maybe like that. I think that’s a fundamentally flawed proposition, I would submit to you. And it’s flawed for a couple of reasons and let me share those with you. With some realistic talk about how you actually have to deal with al-Qaeda. Counterterrorism operations require two things, it requires intelligence, and it requires the ability to offensively strike against them. You need to know where they are, what they’re up to, and you need to be able to strike at them. There are only two sources of intelligence, if you’re tracking al-Qaeda folks up in the borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And I’ve spent a good deal of the last two years, in those two countries. One is by signals intelligence, where you try and track where they are by their cell phone. Even as texting New Yorkers have found out that cell phones can be dangerous to your health, the al-Qaeda guys have gradually stopped revealing themselves by the same notion, which leaves you, really, relying upon human intelligence. Spies, in other words. We don’t have a lot of spies on the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the intelligence that we get about al-Qaeda and their fellow travelers compassed from the intelligence networks run by the Afghans, and the networks run by the Pakistanis. If we walked away, why on earth would they share that intelligence with us. Let’s assume for the moment that you did have the intelligence about where a cell was who were planning another attack in New York or in a London subway. How do you strike at them. Right now the way we do it is with UAV Predators. They have a flight range of about 400 miles. It’s 600 miles from Waziristan to the Indian Ocean. Which leaves you the option maybe like the Clinton administration did in 1998, with launching a Cruise missile at them, but in the hours that it takes to target and launch a Cruise missile, the target’s probably gone, and worse, since it’s not accurate, you have a lot of collateral damage, a lot of dead civilians, and the cycle continues. Fundamentally, to protect this national interest, that I believe even the other team agrees, to protect ourselves from terrorism, we need access, and cooperation, in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. We don’t need Vermont. We don’t need to stabilize the whole country, you don’t even need to engage in counterinsurgency activities across the whole landscape. But you do need cooperation, you do need access, and this is about as stark a statement of national interest that I can think of. ",1.0
for,"Well, to begin with, it was, I did appreciate the fact that sacred scripture was brought to the meeting here so it could be read to us. In fact these words inscribed in that manual are in fact the same doctrine that we used in the 1960s and ‘70s across the world. And as I said, we had a varying pattern of success depending on how tough the opposition was and how long we were willing to stick with it. With regard to Iraq, with the greatest of respect to Colonel Nagl, I would submit in fact that whatever it is that people call the surge, people are creating these fanciful concepts with single words as a public relations gimmick. The surge, what was the surge, an increase of 30,000 troops or so, in Iraq for some period of time? That was certainly useful in the Baghdad area in the context of Iraqi neighborhoods that had been largely cleansed ethnically or at least in a sectarian way, and then a lotta walls were built to separate these people, that worked very well indeed. But I would submit to you that what really worked out in Anbar, in the places where he said-- in other places in Iraq--was the fact that we adopted a very simple, old-fashioned tool that has been used in the Middle East from time immemorial and often by the colonial powers. And that is in fact that we looked at our enemies and instead of believing that they were all one thing as had been advocated for three or four of the first years of the war, we actually looked at them and decided they were many different things.

You can do that in exactly the same way it was done in Iraq because there are lots and lots of available, rentable Afghans out there.

But as I said before, this was a small-scale problem. Afghanistan is not a small-scale problem in terms of applying a general counterinsurgency strategy to this place because it involves economic development, political reform, and counterguerrilla operations.

And in fact, there was—did not a thing happen until, the people of the United States over some hiccup in world events then, told their members of Congress that they wanted a law passed to prevent this happening again, and the Congress passed a law that said not under any circumstances would the United States ever assist South Vietnam again.

It’s easy to have this intellectual debate. But it’s really to an extent a moot point because the Army and Marines are out of troops. They are tired. They are worn. This isn’t an abstract issue. In order to send 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan on what I believe is a fool’s errand…based upon history, we would have to send some troops directly from Iraq to Afghanistan. Now we’ve been at this for eight years. We’ve had some great successes in targeting al-Qaeda and smashing them. We’ve—that makes sense in terms of our security. But teaching better dental hygiene to Afghan villagers does not persuade the Arab terrorists in al-Qaeda to stop attacking America, and America’s interests, so John, no, I do not agree that we can succeed in counterinsurgency.

We’re—I’m arguing and others are arguing, do you want to get back to focusing on America’s enemies, which is much cheaper, more effective, and…just briefly. We are repeating the last war in Afghanistan. The surge, the surge. What happened in Afghanistan although the surge helped, was that al-Qaeda was a foreign invader. We were too. But al-Qaeda was so monstrous, that they alienated millions of Muslims. And when the Sunni Muslims decided that they were—al-Qaeda was a much more horrible and threatening foreign invader than we were, the game was won. In Afghanistan, the Taliban are the home team.

But within those enclaves which contain a large part of the population, you know, you can do all these things that people want to do that are, are good and worthy projects such as the education of women and the improvement of daily life, all that kinda stuff. But in fact, you know, someone said earlier that you can’t go after the bad people unless you’ve got good and sufficient human intelligence. Well, and that—you won’t be able to do that if they think you’re not going to pacify the country. Well I don’t—I’m sorry, I don’t believe that’s true, you know, I was in the business of running human intelligence for the Defense Department for a long time. And in fact the way that you recruit spies, is—a variety of inducements often based on their peculiar psychology, each and every person, you know. And it’s a question of applied psychology in the field. So, the fact that you couldn’t acquire people, if you had a number of bases around in Afghanistan you couldn’t acquire people that you could use to penetrate enemy formations and then have enough troops on the ground, not the huge force of the troops, but some troops, augmented by the Afghan national army, and using a lot of these tribal guys, who don’t like the radicalism of the Taliban or Wahhabi-inspired, absolute kind of Islam that they don’t like, you know, you can go after enough of our enemies to disrupt them and keep them at bay, without having to try to take this whole country over, and to transform it into something that’ll be altogether different.

against,"The McChrystal report advocates the creation of a very large and strong Afghan army in order to enable an American departure, leaving behind a stable Afghanistan that does not support terror, and that does not drag down the region, putting further burdens on Pakistan and the other neighbors. That Afghan army of some 250,000 which is roughly three times the Afghan army today is something we know how to build. This is not something we’ve worked to build to date. The Afghan army is undersized, only 80,000, about twice the size of the New York City police force. New York City is a tough town, but Afghanistan is tougher, and a whole heck of a lot bigger. So, until we start—and by the way right now today as we speak, we are only providing 50 percent of the advisors to the Afghan national army that we say are required. We’re fixing that now, this is another one of the 4,000 additional troops President Obama sent back in March are just arriving in country now, the Fourth Brigade of the 82nd Airborne. So we need to build an Afghanistan that can survive without us, and we are starting that effort now. We are eight years into this thing, we frankly — No, the— The Afghan— the Afghan institutions will be the Afghan national army. That will be the single most important institution. It is today the most respected institution in Afghanistan— --already. Well, you know, we’re not really good at building institutions anywhere, as I think you pointed out in your question, and I concur with Dr. Lang on that point. But in the end the Afghans are going to do this. I mean, eight years is a long time, but it’s pretty fast to come from basically devastation… three decades of destruction, at the hands of various invaders, to actually hold an election themselves. I mean it’s pretty amazing, and when you travel through the provinces and towns of Afghanistan, and you see what was there before, and you see what’s there now…it’s— So that’s the answer, the Afghans are going to work it out.

And they’re off, they are rumored to have helped seed the terrorist groups in Mumbai and they are active with some elements of the Taliban. And I asked this general, I said does President Musharraf, then-President Musharraf control the ISI and this General Jurani told me that President Musharraf has a lot to gain by acting like he doesn’t. And, in that kind of world, it’s, as Steve Coll knows better than anyone else, you have a problem where we’re not always quite sure where the security apparatus of that state is. And that regardless, and I agree completely that something interesting has been achieved in Pakistan, so let them have it. Let them become their own barriers to Islamic jihadism and the most extreme elements of their societies. And I think if you’re fair with Pakistan society they’ve done a fairly good job of keeping the minority extreme parties… Islamist parties have been kept a minority in their political system. Let that continue to percolate, I don’t think it’s quite as vulnerable at even the point where we were worried before the Swat offensive. So, to a certain degree that’s there but I also worry about the fact that, the ISI may be taking us for a ride again, where we don’t quite know when they’re going to push buttons that actually destabilize the situation. I think Steve is right to say we have an opportunity to maybe get a deal, a grand bargain. But I have some concerns about that, just given the behaviors we’ve seen, and our own lack of contact with a whole range of managers, colonels and majors, within the ISI today that maybe Pat Lang needs to go over and spend some time with but— Again—? We all know who he is.  No, no, that’s not what we’re advocating— No. I—where did I ever say kill them and get out. You show me one place. One of my books, one article, one TV show, when did I say that. That’s just nonsense. What I said was what—Joe Biden’s saying. That we need a small, lethal force focused on our enemies. Of course we need boots on the ground— Yeah— That, that is not— That— Yeah, what is the question— Well, for two reasons. First of all because, you’re mixing apples and oranges— General McChrystal was given a mission, by the President. And the mission was pacify Afghanistan. He succeeded wonderfully, in the counterterrorism. But he has failed miserably and we will continue to fail, in the pacification effort. Now, nobody—I hate this stuff where people twist what you say. I said that we need a compact, lethal force, you need boots on the ground for intelligence, you need Special Forces, you need enough conventional forces for raising security. You probably need 15 or 25,000 guys. You don’t need 120,000 guys, and so, again, let’s—please, let’s be fair to each other and listen to what the other persons say, and not try to score points. The other answer is this. I get calls from the military around the world. There’s a myth out there that the military supports General McChrystal’s strategy. The calls I get are running about 50 to 1 against sending more troops. Only call or message I’ve gotten supporting General McChrystal’s strategy, came from Kabul, and one of General McChrystal’s subordinates.",2.0
for,"Well I think we’ve moved on beyond that, the question of the day here. I don’t have any quarrel at all really with what Steve said there. This is really a question of strategy and methodology, rather than ultimate goals with regard to this place I think. And I would point out to you that I would maintain completely that if in fact we decided to do a countryside wide in the hot parts of Afghanistan, all the Pashtun, across the Pashtun Belt and some other places as well, I think that the costs are going to go up so high in all the various ways that I’ve said before, you know, that in a couple years’ time you’re going to decide that there is going to be an endgame, right, because it’s got to—because we’re going to leave. That’s going to be the problem, and that’ll be bad, in a way because, this place will continue to be a breeding ground for Islamic zealots who are in league with other Islamic zealots in other parts of the world and who are dangerous to us. So that shouldn’t happened, I would propose in fact, instead that what we ought to do, is hold the major cities, make sure that, that the Taliban don’t have a seat in the UN again, and use these places as bases from which we can affect a strategy of in-depth human penetration of the groups we really don’t like, and the use of various dissident parts of the tribal population that can be used for our purposes and they can be used for our purposes, I—this is not an impossible thing to do. And have a certain number of troops on the ground that you can use for those kinds of purposes. Now, that would be a far smaller number of troops probably than we have. Now, in that kind of strategy it may well be that there’s not going to be an endgame, in fact. Because this place is going to be dangerous for a long, long time, people there are not going to change very quickly, although we’ll do everything we can to improve their lives if they— And it may be necessary to maintain a presence in that country for a very long time, in order to ensure that we can carry out the goals of protecting the American people, that we need to focus on.",3.0
against,"Pat has just described what to my eyes is the critical weakness of a counterterrorism strategy, which is that there is no end state, that we’ll have to be there forever. And I believe that the American people deserve security, and that the Afghan people deserve security and that there’s a way to achieve that in a reasonable period of time with a reasonable commitment of resources. I have tried the counterterrorism strategy, I have tried to practice counterinsurgency without enough boots on the ground, in al-Anbar Province in 2004. I worked to train Iraqi police and Iraqi army, the insurgents killed them. I worked to build better economic opportunities for the Iraqi people, and they were destroyed by the insurgents. And so, much as we would like there to be an easy way out of this, if we ever want to depart Afghanistan and have that flank secure, with al-Qaeda never again able to use Afghanistan as a safe haven for terror, then there is an investment we are going to have to make. We have made an extraordinary investment already, and it is, frankly it is many of my friends, your sons and daughters, your friends who are out making that investment. The best chance for a positive return on that investment, a secure and stable Afghanistan, a secure and stable Pakistan. Objectives that all of us here agree are of vital national interest to the United States, but should be accomplished, and it is within the power of the United States to accomplish. It is my personal belief that the best way to accomplish them, is through a properly resourced counterinsurgency strategy that is the approach advocated by General McChrystal, it is hard, but hard is not impossible.",3.0

The issue is not just Afghanistan and Pakistan, it’s the bigger picture, of what is going on in the United States, rewriting to some degree America’s place in the world in what I think is a historic moment of opportunity but discontinuity with the past. Barack Obama has a huge challenge. The mystique of America’s superpower status was somewhat shattered by Iraq, where other nations saw our limits, our military limits, our economic limits, and our moral limits. All of that has to be reinvented. And while I’ve heard great arguments from our colleagues on the other side, I have not seen a general understanding that we need to begin thinking about the sort of place and mission we have 20 or 30 or 40 years out. We haven’t discussed nearly enough what alternative strategies might actually generate a better human-rights regime, better opportunities for women democratic rights that we’ve seen fail miserably I think in the recent elections, under our management. We were the stewards of that election that just unfolded, in great degree and to some—and I think no matter where you look, turned out to be quite a bad deal. And trying to restore America’s place and the sense that America has leverage over important global affairs, is really vital in dealing with nuclear nonproliferation. Iran, recreating some sense that we have consequence and weight. So it’s not just about Afghanistan and Pakistan, being stuck in the mud there, and not coming up, and just having a strategy that throws more troops at the challenge, without saying how can you get to some consistent level of benchmarks that are shared within a team both military and on the smart power side of the equation.

But I also think we have, the President has on his desk a fairly clear strategy, by about the best people we can think to do it. And execution matters…properly resourcing it matters, and signaling matters, to the Taliban, to the Afghans, and to the Pakistanis.

If the Karzai government is worthy, why don’t Afghans support it. Why did they have to steal an election. If Afghans want us to stay, why are our casualties climbing dramatically.
