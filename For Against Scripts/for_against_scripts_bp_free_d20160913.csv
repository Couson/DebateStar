for," Well, this is a question every politician and business is asking today, right? How do we appeal to the millennials? I think the answer probably has something to do with participation trophies or something along those lines, but the fact is that you will see more third-party candidates, I think, like Gary Johnson. But so far, in this election of all elections, where you think they'd see -- do really well, the polls aren't showing it yet, so -- -- maybe the two parties still have a link -- a grasp on it. And my partner is Ben Domenech. Good to be with you. As a personal matter, I signed on to the National Review Against Trump cover, but as a publication, we welcome views from all across the political spectrum. And just to suggest to Tim, I think that the answer to your question about appealing to millennials just involves Harambe in some way or another.",nan

for,"Thank you, John. So, why does the Republican Party choose to nominate Donald Trump, a man who, as John Mulaney tells us, begins every day by asking himself, ""What would a cartoon rich person do?"" The key to understanding the Donald Trump phenomenon is to recognize that he is neither a disease nor a symptom. He is a beta test for a cure. Americans are turning to him because he represents the breakdown of the post-Cold War left/right politics of the nation, a breakdown that has been happening in slow motion for the past two decades, fueled by a dramatic decline of trust in America's elites. The percentage of Americans today with a great deal of trust in the presidency, the courts, the public schools, and the banks are in the teens. Trust for unions, the justice system, big business, Congress, and the media are in single digits. This decline didn't happen overnight. It began with Watergate and Vietnam, and continued through the financial crisis and the Iraq War. Real failures undermined confidence in the capacity of elite institutions to do good and in their capability to represent the interests of the people. Now, working and middle class Americans are re-asserting themselves against the bipartisan political and cultural establishment, utterly discredited due to their record of failure. The list is familiar to you all by now: 9/11, Iraq, Katrina, Congressional corruption, financial meltdown, bank bailouts, failed stimulus, a healthcare mess, stagnant wages, rising distrust, diminished hopes. 16 years of bipartisan failures by Republicans and Democrats alike to live up to what the people wanted. This distrust was earned. Through it all the elites were looking out for the interest of people other than those they were elected to serve. It's no accident that Donald Trump broke with the Republican party's orthodoxies on the issues of immigration, trade, and foreign policy, because those are the bipartisan elite consensus views favored by the donor class, by big business, and by party leadership to the exclusion of others. Rather than responding to the populous tendencies that we all saw rising up from this electorate with real changes, the elites over-promised and under-delivered. They thought they could get by holding a musket over their head in election years and prioritizing what lobbyists want in all other years. They were comfortable in a bubble of economic success, a world away from the areas that never saw any recovery. Elite indifference to populous opinion and the economic pain many Americans continue to experience created a vacuum that Donald Trump was happy to fill. A number of smart commentators on the right and the left have delved into the question of America's lost greatness, and they've discovered what would lead voters to find Donald Trump's message so appealing. It's the same phenomenon identified by Chris Hayes on the left in Twilight of the Elites, and on the right by Charles Murray and Yuval Levin in Coming Apart and The Fractured Republic. It's a dramatic failure of the institutions run by America's elites and nostalgia for a time when such mediating institutions could be trusted. Imagine you are one of the millions of middle-aged, unemployed, white Americans with a high school degree. There are today seven million men in prime working age who have dropped out of the labor force. That's 15 percent. That's higher than ever -- than since the end of the Great Depression. There are millions more who know people personally experiencing this kind of pain as a brother, as an uncle, as a son. Moved from unemployment to disability, you will receive sufficient benefits to subsist, around $1,200 a month, which is enough to pay for the alcohol and the drugs that help you self-medicate. Your life is essentially one marked by hopelessness, desperation and anxiety. You are statistically unlikely to ever re-enter the workforce and alone among all demographics the likelihood of suicide is rising for you. The things that make life not only endurable but happy are religious faith now lost to you, family which is fractured, community which is disintegrated, and work which you find hard to come by. The TV screen flickers with images of people living lives you could never hope to emulate. Your situation is bleak and while our soma today is better it is still not a replacement for the pursuit of happiness. Your tomorrows look dark, but the past, even the grimy parts of it, look like gold. And when a golden-haired man comes on TV, a man who represents a vision of what you might hope your life could be like, a man who is a traitor to his class, who defies the elites, who is rich and successful, who comes from the world of the elites but is strong enough to reject them and their lies and he tells you it's not your fault. It's not your fault that your life is the way it is. He tells you it's the fault of immigrants and bad trade deals and wasteful, pointless wars based on lies. He tells you the problem with the elites is not that they are too conservative or that they are too liberal, but that they are stupid and don't care about you. He tells you with confidence that he alone can make everything great again and you listen. In the absence of the failures of the elites, could Donald Trump succeed? The answer is no. Our elite leadership class sowed the wind and Donald Trump is the whirlwind they've reaped. Vote for the motion.",nan
against,"I want to begin my opening remarks by asking you in the audience a few questions. First question. How many of you in this audience have been to Europe in the last five years? Raise your hand.  How many people in this audience live in Manhattan or let's just say New York City or a New York City-like suburb like Westchester. Raise your hands.   How many people in this audience have graduate degrees? Once again, I would say most hands went up, right? One more question. I'm very curious. Generally speaking, Sancerre is white or red wine?  White seems to be the consensus. You are correct.  Why am I asking these questions? It's very simple. I hate to break it to you, but you are the elite. You live in the most expensive city in America. You travel voluntarily across the ocean to look at paintings you could find on Google. You drink wine that never costs less than $20 a bottle. You're the elite and so this proposition is very simple. Do you blame yourselves -- -- for the rise of Donald Trump? Now, my friends on the opposite side would like to imagine the elite is someone else. All right? It's the billionaire class that you sometimes hear about. It's those corrupt politicians, Democrats or Republicans in Washington. It's some idea of an elite and yet it's you. And so here's the question that we have to confront tonight, and it's an important question and it's going to be a very telling question, I think, psychologically speaking. Do you indict yourselves tonight for the rise of Donald Trump? Are you yourself to blame for this immigrant bashing? For this American firsting? For this Putin man-crushing? For this woman-hating? For this charity short-changing? For this genitalia boasting? For this Chapter 11 indulging? For this Mussolini admiring disgrace of a Republican candidate for the presidency of the United States? That is the question. Now what you've just heard from Ben was an astonishingly condescending portrait of who the Trump voter is, and you're going to hear from my friend, Jennifer, about just who a little -- a few more specifics about who that is, not the guy nodding off in a heroin induced coma because he's been thrown out of his job, okay? There are, I am sure, even in this highly elite audience that just cheered wildly when I offered a fairly precise description of this joke of a candidate, there are some -- probably some Trump supporters in this audience. Let me ask those Trump supporters, don't raise your hands, because -- -- I don't want to put you in jeopardy, okay? Did you recognize yourself in that caricature? Are you going to walk out of here and go to the bathroom and shoot up just after this? I don't think so. We live in a democracy and people think democracy is about freedom.  It's about accountability. It's about we the people being responsible for the choices we make in our lives and at the voting booth. Who do you blame for the Trump phenomenon? Well, Bob Rosenkranz I think put it well. He blames, or one could blame, the Trump voter. One could blame the people who are responding to this message of intolerance, bigotry, and fake victimization. They're the ones who are primarily accountable. If you want to find another culprit, I would offer you the parade of demagogues who have emerged in the ether on certain cable news shows, on certain radio shows, some of them have first names that are like Sean, for example, or Rush, for example. I'm not mentioning last names. There are lots of Sean's and Rush's out there. And this is a pattern that in history we know very well. It is the pattern of the demagogue, demagoguing to a public or to a part of a public that wants easy answers and people to blame. They are accountable for those choices. Do not feel guilty for standing apart from them and do not condescend to them by saying that they have no moral agency, no personal agency in the disastrous political choice they may be about to make. ",1.0
for," And not to talk outside of school, but Jen Rubin did say onstage before this all began that any one of us would do better than Donald Trump on the debate stage, and I think that Bret Stephens just recently showed that his debating and sophistry skills far exceed Donald Trump. The argument -- if we're going to take it seriously -- is that this audience, which means my mom, a retired stay-at-home mom, and the almost out of work actor I met in the reception back there -- that they are the elites, but that Sean Hannity is not. He's trying to exculpate Sean Hannity and -- or trying to say Sean Hannity is to blame, and is not part of the elites, and this crowd is. I think we need to get more specific. I think we need to define who the elites are that we're talking about. And I'm happy to name very specific names. They are the men and women -- mostly the men -- who were in charge over the past decades, who led our country to the point it is now. They are George W. Bush. They are Mitt Romney. These are the people who were elected, nominated officials, put in charge of the public good. They're Mitch McConnell and John Boehner and their predecessors. And it's telling to talk about their predecessors -- Tom Delay, who invited a lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, into not just the Republican Party, but in to make Washington D.C. be a favor factory for the well-connected. Bill Frist, a Senate Majority Leader who now runs Frist Capital -- that invests in healthcare companies. So, he lobbies for Obamacare that enriches the hospitals he's investing in, both driving up the prices and taking away the options for everybody else. Former Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole, also an Obamacare lobbyist living very well by lobbying to take away the -- lobbying for drug companies that want to keep generics off the market. Eric Cantor supposedly representing Virginia's 7th District as a House Majority Leader, really representing Wall Street. Eric, are you here tonight? Because he retired to a job here. These men enrich themselves while supposedly in the public trust. Currently, five of the six richest counties in America are within commuting distance of the U.S. capital. That is not the sign of a healthy republic. That is a sign of insiders who rigged a game in their favor. So, they are extracting wealth from the rest of the society. This is the Hunger Games, ladies and gentlemen. Again, five of the six richest counties in America are within commuting distance. And that's why you got a Tea Party. That's why 2009, 2010 -- this wasn't a pro-Republican uprising, simply, or, you know, a fix-the-debt uprising, simply. It was a populist uprising. It was anger at bailouts. It was anger at a stimulus that was just handouts to the Chamber of Commerce. It was anger at an Obamacare that was just handouts to the drug companies and the hospitals. And Republican leaders, these elites, the men and women in power, gave lip service. Democratic leaders did too. And then, what did they do? They squelched that populist uprising. In public, they would say, ""Yes, we need to get rid of crony capitalism,' and then they would go behind closed doors with the crony capitalist donors and say, ""Well, yes, that bottom 47 percent, well, they just won't take responsibility for their lives."" That was Mitt Romney's description. If you were in the bottom 47 percent, it is literally your fault, and you don't belong in the Republican Party. ""You may not join our country club."" That was the message from the Republican elites. And after they lost, they issued an autopsy, as they called it. Item number one was, ""Well, we need more low-skilled immigrants in."" A laser-guided program aimed at lowering the wages of the low-skilled. So, populism rose. The party elites tried to quelch it. They rigged the system. They enriched themselves. That's a systematic problem Ben and I have laid out. That's the system that they rigged. But I want to conclude with a very specific way, immediate way, in which the elites bear the blame. On that stage last year was Jeb Bush, backed by $100 million of donor money. He was the man in the arena. He was literally the man on the stage, and he failed to rise to the occasion. He was the one who could have beaten Donald Trump. Whom do we blame for Donald Trump being the nominee? The people who could have beaten him. Jeb Bush was number one. Chris Christie, probably the pick of a lot of you here, he disappointed me as well. He didn't rise to the occasion. He thought more important than attacking Donald Trump was attacking Marco Rubio. And then, when Christie lost, he scampered over to become the valet for Donald Trump. There's that saying of ""No man is -- no matter how great -- is thought great by his valet."" I think the only exception is Trump and Christie. The backup of the elites was Marco Rubio. And he couldn't rise to the occasion either. He proved unable to move beyond his canned lines. And so -- and what did most of the elites do when it boiled down, when they had an alternative, when they had Ted Cruz, who may not be the favorite of here -- but is somebody other than Donald Trump. And remember, the question on the table is ""Whom do we blame for Donald Trump?"" Well, we know what Christie did. House Speaker John Boehner in the spring, during the debate, called Ted Cruz ""Lucifer in the flesh,"" literally. And he called Donald Trump his buddy. Bob Dole, the majority leader turned lobbyist, said of Trump, ""He's got the right personality. He's kind of a deal-maker."" You had mayor-turned presidential candidate turned-lobbyist Rudy Giuliani -- said, if it came down to Trump or Cruz, quote, ""There is no question I'd vote for Trump."" Majority leader-turned lobbyist Trent Lott told a reporter that he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. And then, of course, there was Hillary. She's the nominee. Any normal, decent candidate would be mopping the floor with this thrice-married, philandering, con-man, liberal candidate trying to run as a Republican. She can't do it. Why not? Because she chooses opacity at all occasions, that the ""deplorable"" public doesn't deserve to know her business. These are the elites. These were the people who set the stage for Trump. These were the people who could have beaten Trump, who could have made him run away. They all failed. It's clear that we need to blame the elites for the Trump Phenomenon.",1.0
against,"Like Donald Trump himself, our distinguished opponents suffer from a lack of factual support for their motion. They paint a picture not unlike Donald Trump does -- of a dystopia of heroin addicts, of despair, of poverty, of people sold short. Now, none of us should minimize the suffering, the social and economic dislocation that occurred in the wake of the 2008 crash. But let's get real here. Let's not play in Donald Trump's made up America. Just today, it comes out that 2015, we had record income growth in America. 5.2 percent. It comes out that that poverty is on the decline. It comes out that homeownership is rising. And this wasteland of manufacturing -- that doesn't exist either. In fact, we've picked up about 900,000 manufacturing jobs in recent years. And we have a record high number of open manufacturing jobs. So, if any of your children would like to forego an expensive elite college and instead become workers in manufacturing firms, I would strongly encourage them to do so. It's bizarre, frankly, that we should concoct an economic argument that not only does not exist, but that is contrary to just about every conservative economic principle. Conservatives, you see, do not believe that immigration causes unemployment. That's a zero-sum thinking that we usually attribute to our friends on the left. It's factually not true, and philosophically, it's abhorrent to conservatives who do not believe that ""if I win, you lose."" Conservatives do not believe that millions of jobs were lost because of free trade. That's nonsense. We know that there has been a shuffling of the workforce. We know that more automized, more sophisticated workplace requires different skills, but we have not lost millions and millions of jobs to Mexico. China did not steal our jobs. This is the sort of economic fallacy that Donald Trump peddles. It's also a little bit bizarre, as my esteemed colleagues were talking, to think that Bob Dole, who's about as elitist as possible, could support Donald Trump. I thought he was a populist, and suddenly you have someone who is not a populist who is one of these elites who failed responsible for Donald Trump? That seems peculiar. It also seems frightfully unfair to blame the losers of 2016, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio. They may have not been the most competent politicians, but they offered an optimistic message of growth, of an American century, of a confident America in the world. And to blame them for Donald Trump seems awfully scurrilous When I think of the causes of Donald Trump, and we'll have plenty of time to discuss this later on, in addition to the voters themselves, I think how is it that so many people got these wrong ideas about the economy? I don't mean politically incorrect ideas, I mean wrong, factually wrong. Where could they have heard this? Where could they have gotten the notion that America doesn't win anymore? Where could they have gotten the notion that immigrants are to blame? Where could they have gotten the notion that trade steals our jobs? Ah, those were the folks that Bret Stephens mentioned. This is, and there really is one, a vast right-wing conspiracy. This is the toxic brew of right-wing media, right-wing politicians, charlatans out to make a buck, and for years they have dumped this dribble into the laps of voters who, as Bret says, it would be nice to blame immigrants. It would be nice to blame foreigners. But where do we get these wrong-headed ideas? It's the Sean's, the Rush's, and many others who have told you a story not unlike the ones our opponents did, which has no bearing in reality. Now if Donald Trump were really the result of an economic down boom or economic collapse, you'd think that they'd be poor, right? You know what the average salary, the average income of a Trump voter is? $72,000. These are not people down on their luck. These are people looking to blame others. ",1.0

They have poisoned the body politic. They have made, as we have seen in history so many times, the outsider, the other -- the source of these people's hardship. It's not unusual, I think, that media and social media should be such a fixation with Donald Trump. What's his favorite medium?  There the so-called alt-right, the right-wing and the white nationalists congregate and there his message is spread in all of social media's glory. And what is it? It's not a message of economic revival or renewal, it's a message of anti-Semitism, of racism, of misogyny. So, yes, I do hold the voters responsible, but they've had some help along the way.",2.0

Gary Lemay , who is out there, two tours in the Persian Gulf, disabled, can't find a job. Was promised by his Congressman, Paul Ryan, that he was going to get help. Didn't get it. Jeff Mason, the factory worker, the son of a factory worker who is now driving a truck for half the wages of that. And you tell them that there's simply shuffling of the workforce.  The markets have winners and losers when they do it. The Republican leadership explicitly promised that they were going to fight for these people, and they repeatedly delivered -- not just free trade, but subsidized trade. Not just open borders, but again, bringing in guest workers, importing -- not allowing low-skilled workers to come over, but importing workers who have -- who are totally unfree to leave their jobs, because that's an immediate deportation.

However much money he may have. All right? Back to the point. So, all of these people who are making -- you know, I don't know, third, fourth quintile of income, they're affected by the same forces. And yet, they see Trump for who he is, and they're refusing to respond to his message. Who is responding to the message, and why? It's not because of class. It's not because of globalization.

The first is, one of the most telltale signs of whether you're going to be a Trump voter or not was actually not your own economic success -- it was your proximity to economic anxiety. There have been multiple looks at this. We have a great deal of data on this. NBC News did a fantastic report by Benjy Sarlin, and I encourage you to look it up, that looked at Trump's America. And what they found was the people who were most actively in favor of Donald Trump was not the person suffering from the opioid crisis, it's the person who knows that person. It's their father. It's their mom. It's the person who thinks that we need dramatic change in this country. And that, to me, is a telltale sign of why this rejection is one of the elites. It is a rejection of the people who have been in charge. They want a dramatic change agent. That change agent is not a good vehicle for the change that they actually want to achieve, in my view. But it is an element of change, an instant where they're -- they feel that they have to do something dramatically different in order to get something different from our government.

The Wall Street Journal was writing those editorials at the time.

But the cronyism -- -- the cronyism, a, is reaching new heights. I mean, again, you look at this. You look at the bailouts of Wall Street. You look at Obamacare, where you had -- again, these are Republican leaders, the people who were put in power, Bob Dole, and Bill Frist, and Billy Tauzin -- all enriching themselves off of this corrupt law that then takes away choice from consumers.

There are a lot of people who shared that opinion, but the elite consensus in Washington, the bipartisan consensus, was that ""you're not allowed to want that thing."" And that was being told to the base of the Republican Party for years. It's not racist to want to actually enforce our immigration laws. That's something that's an opinion held by a lot of people who are not racist or misogynist, and voted for Donald Trump not because they thought that he was going to say racist things, and misogynist things, and that they enjoyed that -- but because they thought that he would stand up to the existing elite consensus in Washington and turn it on its head. And to point out that racism and misogyny that Donald Trump peddles appeals to racists and misogynists is simply deflecting. Yes, Donald Trump bears blame for the Donald Trump phenomenon, but the fact is the elites have helped set up the system in which that kind of stuff has purchase. It's like when people -- when liberals said that greed was responsible for the Wall Street collapse in 2008. That's like saying airplanes -- gravity is responsible for an airplane crash. Racism and misogyny are always there. Why is it happening now? It's because the elites have failed, and a lot of the working class, a lot of the out of power -- the people who don't live in those five of the six richest counties within the Beltway, they feel the game is rigged against them and the demagogue now is able to grab them because the elites failed them.",2.0

So, the fact is I agree -- the way I've put it is that there has long been sort of a subsidy propping up low-skilled white guys and to some extent this disappeared, that we have restrictions on trade, restrictions on immigration and low-skilled white guys had higher wages than they long did. And so you could say things are becoming more fair. I agree, but the fact is that the white working class has seen their wages fall while Hispanics, while women, while black women, not black men, but every other group has seen their wages go up since 1999. So, these people who didn't rig the game in their favor, the working class whites that did not rig the game in their favor in the 1990s, it became unrigged and now they see things going against them. And the fact is, the Republicans told them, if the Republicans hadn't over-promised, the Republican elites over-promised. They said we're going to repeal your Obamacare, we're going to restore your wages, that they constantly made those promises and never delivered. So, the victimization, some of it's real, some of it's fake, but the fact is the Republican elites were the ones getting up the hopes.",2.0
against,"Well, we were talking about deplorable, not irredeemable and we Jews just believe in good and evil. We don't think everyone is redeemable. Be that as it may, -- Yeah. Be that as it may, there is something disturbing. In one poll we saw earlier in the year, 59 percent of Trump voters believe President Obama was born in Kenya. That, I'm sorry, you can call it whatever you want, but you're not responsible for it and that is racism. And there have always been in history, whether it was the Jews, whether it was the blacks, whether it was the immigrants, whether it was the communists, whether it was the gays, there's a long list of culprits that are dragged out to explain why people aren't responsible for their own lives. As Israeli friends of mine like to say “it's depend.” I bet everyone in this room is doing a pretty good job of whatever it is they're doing, doctors, educators, lawyers, whatever. That's part of the elite. Is the Washington elite doing a pretty good job?  The Washington elite is not doing such a pretty good job.  That's -- I don't think that's particularly controversial, okay? But the real question is then are they doing such a horrendous job that they've created this utter dystopia where we walk out into a kind of war zone that we hardly recognize. You know, you watch certain cable news shows that I won't mention here and you would think that this country is utterly falling apart. How parochial is this? Go someplace, people, and look at the way the world is and feel blessed with all of our problems here in America to be in the United States today.",2.0
for,"The issue here, I think, really is a lack of appreciation for the level of dramatic change that the American people want to see. When I started out I talked about the number of people who have a significant amount of faith in various institutions and I mentioned Congress. Congress actually has zero percent in that, okay?  The level of dramatic change people want to see, I think, is a lot bigger than just the people that Bret is talking about. The -- Fox News just had its best quarter that it's ever had, but the average viewership on each day was 1.3 million people. You would have to have a situation where all of those people were going out and getting nine of their friends to vote for Donald Trump to get the totals that he got. Because this is like a strip club and every time he says something dirty it turns out people want more of it. And so what he was doing, what he was doing they're like take it off, take more off, take more off. He was appealing to the pornographic instinct of a part of the American population. What was happening was the species of political pornography. Now, Mrs. Clinton just said this terrible thing, the ""basket of deplorables"" and we're all saying oh, it was bad politics, but you know what? It wasn't untrue. It wasn't untrue.  YouGov, which is a polling agency, does a poll. There was a story in the Economist about this, which you know, last I checked was not a terrible source of media, looks like 58 percent of the respondents who said they backed Mr. Trump resided in the polls highest quartile for combined racial resentment scores and we all know that this is about right. I just think that this is a lot more about the dramatic change that people want to see within this country feeling that the system is rigged against them, feeling the dramatic changes necessary, and looking to this man as a vehicle for that change. I don't think it's simply a number of Americans who want to see more racism and misogyny in our public square as if it's a strip club.",2.0

It's this amorphous, nothing word that people toss around to explain who other people are that they don't particularly like. But that's a problem for the motion. We're against the motion, so we don't think that blaming amorphous, indescribable segments of society that can mean anything -- -- you want them to. Okay -- No.",2.0
for,"But why were they bamboozled? Why were they vulnerable to that message? The message really does say a lot more than just racism and misogyny. It's rejection of Republican orthodoxy that's been around for a long time when it comes to the economy. It's rejection of Republican foreign policy, explicitly over and over again. What I keep hearing from Bret and from Jennifer is that nothing really needs to change, that things were actually going pretty much okay, and that Trump just came along and put together this witches brew of racism and misogyny that was able to somehow, you know, bamboozle all these different people. The reason that they were willing -- that they were open to being pulled along these lines is because of real things that were going on in their lives, not just because they wanted more craziness in their media life.  The media elites, at least on the left, made this possible, in part, by over criticizing people who didn't deserve it. If -- the things that were printed about Mitt Romney in 2012 in the New York Times by Paul Krugman called him a ""charlatan,"" ""pathologically dishonest,"" ""untrustworthy."" He said he didn't even pretend to care about poor people, that he wants people to die so that rich people get richer. ""He's completely amoral, a dangerous fool, ignorant as well as uncaring."" If you cry wolf long enough, sometimes the beast actually shows up, okay?

against,"Well, I mean, to your question, sure, the media participated, to some extent, in the rise of this guy. But they weren't pushing him. And they certainly weren't electing him, okay? So, you can look at aspects of what you might call ""elite media,"" whether it's Joe Scarborough or someone like that -- or Mika Brzezinski and find -- to give this character some airtime, thinking, ""He can't possibly go anywhere."" But we're talking about -- what is the phenomenon really all about? So, you will find little points in the media where you'll say, ""This guy is definitely an elitist and this guy bears some kind of blame for Trump's rise."" We're talking about where the blame truly -- where the weight of the blame truly lies. And again, I insist -- and by the way, there's some elite people who support Trump.  Peter Thiel, I guess you could say, is definitely a member of the elite. But no one seriously -- Especially.  But none of that is particularly -- it doesn't dispose of the argument. The real question is, how was Donald Trump -- how was it that we had this moment where a demagogue was able to use tools of social media at his disposal to speak directly to millions of people? Now, you might then say, ""Blame Twitter or blame a new information economy that disintermediates a guy like Trump from -- or disintermediates the media from, you know, between Trump and his audience,"" right? Those are sort of broad phenomenon. It's an interesting discussion. But where does the weight of the blame lie? Is it really the fact that the people who worked hardest to oppose Trump -- so, if I'm elite media, the Wall Street Journal deputy editor, okay? I've done everything in my power to stop this guy. I have done everything under my power to scream from the rooftop that this is a form of demagoguery that we saw in the 1930s in Europe and in the 1970s in Latin America -- we're seeing today in the Philippines. You can blame me for not having a big enough megaphone or for not being an articulate enough columnist, right? And I accept that. But don't blame me -- okay -- or you, or anyone else in this audience, for this phenomenon of hatred, bigotry, nativism, and an angry turn at people who should not be blamed -- whether it's -- quote -- -- elite or -- -- whether it's Hispanics or Muslims.",2.0
for,"I will disagree with Bret's implications that his columnist skills are limited. I think they're excellent, and I don't blame him for anything he's done. He's performed valiantly during this campaign. What I do blame him for -- or his publication for -- is what they did before. I've agreed with the Wall Street Journal 80 percent of the time. But when they were -- and when Bret was advocating for the Iraq War, that was creating this system where the Republicans and where the elites were promising we will be greeted as liberators, and you created a war that helped destroy the Republican Party, made Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House, and that created this total distrust of the government. The support for the Wall Street bailout, which then we saw stock market rally to record highs, and median wages stay totally flat -- until the data we got today. So, yes, the -- Bret Stephens has performed very well this election, but a lot of the elite media there too, by advocating stuff like the disastrous Iraq War, helped set the table for somebody like Trump to say, ""These people are stupid. They don't know what they're doing.""  I would definitely say both parties are responsible for the Bernie Sanders phenomenon. And when I went -- I camped out at Occupy Wall Street. And what I saw there was just a deep dissatisfaction, this idea that people no longer had the ability to control the world around them. Sort of politics, in the Greek sense of the word of being an active member, being a citizen, that that was evaporated, that the concentration of power in Washington, the concentration of wealth, that those were two sides of the same coin and that we had been -- we had been stripped of our power as citizens and that was what drove a huge part of Occupy Wall Street, a huge part of Bernie Sanders, and I do think it was a bipartisan thing to suck power into Washington, D.C. that subsequently sucked wealth into Washington, D.C., left the rest of the country not just poor, but more powerless. Yeah, I go to -- again, I go to these Trump rallies. I've been to a dozen Trump rallies in 10 states and I've talked to them and I wouldn't say that these are the people who are the sharpest policy analysts in the world, but that's not to their discredit. Most normal people don't spend their time doing what we spend our time doing, an analysis on it. They blame it on immigrants and I think that that is inaccurate. They blame it on free trade and I think that that is inaccurate. But the reason that they are blaming it on them -- the reason that -- the fact that they are suffering economically is inarguable. Manufacturing jobs, we've lost millions of them over the last decade and the fact that working class wages is falling is also inarguable. Mostly their solutions, protectionism and closing the borders. I find those both counterproductive and dumb, but their assessment that their own economic and the economic -- as Ben said the economic well-being of their neighbors has gone down, that aspect I see as accurate.",2.0

Who is responsible for the problems that this country faces today and what is some kind of recipe? Now, the Trump message is the people who are responsible are other people, the Chinese and the Mexicans who beat us in trade deals, or Latin American labor that comes in and steals your jobs or Muslims who want to destroy your community. I don't think the question is whether there needs to be change. The question is why is it that they are responding to this message of hatred of others and self-exculpation. No matter how hard we try they've never answered the question as to why Hispanics who have suffered and African Americans who have suffered and women who have not -- who have suffered are not buying this.

That -- in fact, it makes the blame even worse that they've paved the road for this man who could deal with this stuff. What happened was the game was rigged and there was a very conservative way to say this game is rigged, we're going to unrig it, and that was by railing against crony capitalism. That was by going and arguing for a fair freer market and the Republicans instead squelched it. They pushed away the 47 percent and they engaged even more in the crony capitalism. So when they could point at -- when the Republicans could have pointed at the actual perpetrators they didn't, so a guy could come in and he could point at the innocent supposed perpetrators, the immigrants, the blacks, the women, he ran away with it.",2.0

And what was amazing was the sheer degree to which so many of them knew no one, knew no one in their lives who was voting for Donald Trump. It's no question here to me that the elites bear the responsibility for the rise of Trump in part by the thickness of the bubble they have insulated around themselves where they couldn't understand why this phenomenon was happening. From my perspective what we've heard tonight from Jen and from Bret, respectfully, is that the overall agenda was not the problem, that war, that immigration policy, that trade policy, that all of these other critiques that Donald Trump was alleging were not the problem, that it wasn't a problem that we can't run a VA or keep track of a terrorist's wife for 24 hours. None of those things were really the big problem in the country and instead I hear them saying I don't know, I mean, it kind of reminds me of saying you'll be back, time will tell, you'll remember that I served you well. And to me that's just whistling past the point of understanding what was really going on here, which is the American people looked at the agenda that the elites were offering them. They became disgusted with that failure and in their desperation they turned to a man they didn't fully understand because he offered them something different from the failures they knew.

Do not -- I beg you -- do not accord the status of ""victim"" to people like this, or people who say slightly less deplorable things. They are not victims. They are looking to victimize somebody else. And finally, I would say, do not indict yourself for the choices, and mistakes, and the bigotries of other voters. This is a free country. At Trump rallies, people wave American flags. They believe in the American creed. And when you speak to them, they'll say, ""It's time people take some personal responsibility for their bad choices.” Maybe it's time that they should take some personal responsibility for their choices.

Or when the camera was pointed at the elites, they said, ""Well, the actual dagger was driven home by Trump, or the actual vote is being cast by the voters."" And this is an attempt to shift the burden. The burden is not whether Trump voters -- the question is not whether Trump voters are responsible for Trump winning. The question is not whether Trump is responsible for Trump winning, and the question isn't even whether Sean Hannity is responsible for Trump getting the nomination and being at 44 percent in the polls. The question is whether the elites bear blame for this man rising up here, for a party -- a once great party. They used to call themselves ""Grand"" -- whether they're responsible for that party crumbling, whether the elites are responsible for Trump being within striking distance of winning this election. That's the question. You can't let them deflect from it by pointing out that other people are to blame. Of course the blame goes wide. But ultimately, what do we do in this society? What do we, as journalists, try to do? We try to hold the powerful people accountable. You have four journalists on this stage. And we all spend our days doing this. Bret did not win a Pulitzer Prize for nothing. Jen has not been at one of the most widely-respected publications in the country, the Washington Post, for nothing. We hold the powerful people accountable. So, to say that the elites don't deserve the blame -- which is implicit in their motion -- is to say that the people failed their elites.

I must say, when I first got this topic, I thought I would find on the other table Bernie Sanders, or maybe Noam Chomsky.

It's the time where people live longer. Fewer are in poverty. The average person has encyclopedic access to the world's knowledge.

They know about comparative advantage in trade, that both sides benefit. They know the lump of labor fallacy -- that there are only a fixed number of jobs. It's nonsense. At least they used to know that. They don't believe in victimology. They don't believe in blame casting. They don't believe in any of those things. So, it's peculiar in the extreme that we should be facing the arguments of luddite leftists and nativist knuckle-draggers from our opponents. I assume they took this in good faith, but I would like to cling to my belief that they really don't believe this. I would like them -- I would like to believe that conservatives, good conservatives of high principles, still believe that what is known as the liberal international order has brought freedom, prosperity, and happiness to millions.
