for,"Sure, in one sentence, utilitarianism is the view that the right thing to do is the act that will have the best consequences, all things considered, of the options open to you. John Donvan:You nailed it in one sentence.  That's correct. My partner is Andrew Solomon. Andrew's a writer who's written very movingly about this issue. He's also a public speaker. And if you look at the talks he's given on TED, TED.com, you will find that eight million people have viewed them, whereas my talk has only been viewed by one million. Well, it's somewhat less taboo, but in a society in which people tend to be in denial about the reality of mortality altogether, getting them to talk about this is still frequently a struggle. But I think speaking about it openly, as we are doing tonight, is one way to help people be less afraid to tell their families or to tell their doctors what they actually think and feel."
against,"Well, I think it's important to reme mber that doctors know the complexities of trying to do assessments as to whether somebody really wants this or not and all the other issues that would have already been touched on. They also know about advances in medicine and that things toda y are very different. Most of the public sees stuff on the media that looks scary. They're scared about their own dying and we're all going to die. And they also often have memories of things that might have happened a quarter of a century ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just so enthusiastic.  I'd like to introduce the kind, caring Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, who has studied this in -depth -- and is a physician. I think, in some ways, what it really means is I have too many bosses. But beyond that, they fit together seamle ssly for me, really. I mean, doctor, when you think about it, means ""Teacher."" And I try to just be a good teacher for my ethics students, for my medical students, and for my patients."
for,"Because much of modern medicine prolongs not living but dying, we need to rethink death itself. Making someone die in a way that others approve, but that he feels is anathema, is an odious fo rm of tyranny. Aid-in -dying needs to be tightly regulated, as any life or death matter does, from driving to surgery. But while no one should be pressed into assisted dying, no one should be categorically denied that right. It's about dignity. In hi s dissent in Cruzan, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan said, ""An ignoble end steeped in decay is abhorrent. A quiet, proud death, bodily integrity intact, is a matter of extreme confidence. ” And it's about reassurance. Brittan y Maynard , who captured headlines for choosing to end her life at the age of 29 at the end of a battle with brain cancer, said, ""It has given me peace. I do not want to die, but I am dying, and I want to die on my own terms."" It's not about depression. When hope of recovery is gone, when one achieves relief from physical symptoms only at the cost of mental clarity, when – on e’s dignity is lost to physical deterioration, the wish to end your life may be rational. Now, there are some people who find great meaning in those very final stages. But there are other people who are not interested in finding that meaning. And from a non -theological point of view, it can be argued that the meaning people attach to that stage of life is an artifact of the human imagination. It's not about suicide. Suicide responds to personal disintegration while this precludes it. And it is about the limitations of medicine. It's nothing short of medical arrogance to say that palliative care and hospice can adequately deal with the end of every life. Hospice, in fact, can impose an authoritarian, hard, paternalistic view that the hospice way of dying is the only way, and it's rooted in precedent, as John said in the opening, in Oregon, where after 17 years, only 752 people have died from lethal prescriptions, which is to say .2 percent of the people in the state who have died. As Hillary once hoped for abortion, this is safe, legal and rar e, and it has popular support. According to a 2013 Gallup Poll, 70 percent of Americans support legalizationof physician assistance in dying. When my mother's friend, Sandy, was dying of cancer, my mother visited and saw her in the hospital where she was screaming in pain and so heavily medicated that she was unable to recognize the other people in the room. And when she came home, my mother said, ""If I ever get to that state of pain, promise that one of you will shoot me."" M y mother was diagnosed with o varian cancer when she was 56. And when her first chemotherapy failed, she said that she would submit to another round of agonizing treatment only on the condition that someone got her those pill s. By the time of her third chemo, she was in dilapidated health. She was vomiting. She had a persistent malaise, she had hair loss, she was negotiating surgical adhesions, but she also had the pills. And the agony became unimportant because the symptoms w ere permanent only until she decided that she could take no more, and then she would be free, and so the disease was no longer in control of her. My grieving father, my mother, my brother and I talked through the logistics as though a dress rehearsal would exhaust some of the pain of the loss in advance. We planned it together, much as we had once planned parties or family vacations or Christmas. We were liberated by our newly clarified emotions, but we were entombed in the loneliness of our illegal collusion. My mother went to see a gastroenterologist two years after she got sick, who told her that she had significant tumors in her intestines and would soon be unable to digest food. She called my brother and me, and she said that it was time . It was all very much as we had planned it. She said, ""The only thing I still fear is this not going smoothly."" And she took the antiemetics. A few nights earlier, my mother and my brother had pulled a wishbone, and my mother had won. And now my brot her said to her, ""What did you wish for?"" And she said, ""I wished for this to be over as quickly as possible. And I got my wish, I got my wishes so often."" And then she said, ""When you were children, I wanted my love to make the world a safe place for y ou. And my greatest hope is that it will still wrap you up for your whole life."" And she said to my father, ""I would gladly have given decades of my life to be the one to go first. For 30 years, Howard, you have been my life."" And then as her voice slowed with the medication, she said, ""I'm sad to be going."" But even with this early death, I wouldn't want to change my life for any other life in the world. I have loved completely, and I have been completely loved, and I've had such a good tim e. I've looked for so many things in this life, so many things. And all the time, paradise was in this room with the three of you."" I've seen other deaths, and I remember feeling that they belonged to the hospital or the illness or the gun or the catastrophe. This death was my mother's own. She was the same person in death that she had been in life, and it was her right to choose it over a death like Sandy's, and it should be everyone's right. The words ""liberty"" and ""dignity"" are nearly sy nonymous in death as they are in love."
against,"As you heard, I am a physician. And part of my job is to help people die with dignity and in comfort. But I don't want to help you or your daughter or your uncle to commit suicide. And you shouldn't want me to. I urge you to oppose physician -assisted suicide , because it's bad ethical reasoning, bad medic ine and bad policy. I'm going to concentrate on the first of these, and Ilora will take up the other two. Now we strongly support the right of patients to refuse treatments and believe physicians have a duty to treat pain and other symptoms even to the point of hastening death. But empowering physicians to assist patients with suicide is quite another matter. Striking at the heart not just of medical ethics, but of ethics itself. That's because the very idea of interpersonal ethics depends upon our mutual recognition of each other's equal independent worth, the value that we have simply because we are fellow human beings. Some would have you believe that mortality -- that morality depends upon equal interests, usually defined by preferences, and of advanced utilitarian arguments based on that assumption. But which is more important : people or their preferences? As Aristotle observed, small errors at the beginning of an argument lead to large errors at the end. If interests take preference over the people who have them, then assisting thesuicide of a patient who has lost interest i n living is certainly something that would be morally praise worthy. But it would also follow that active euthanasia ought to be permitted, that the severely demented could be euthanized without their explicit consent, even experimented upon. And it also follows that infanticide ought to be permitted for children with congenital illnesses. Now, many might see these as frightful conclusions, but this is not just the slippery slope. These all follow logically from arguing for assisted suicide o n the basis of maximizing our individual interests. So , if you don't believe in euthanizing severely disabled children or the demented, you might want to rethink your support for assisted suicide, at least if you want to be consistent. Now, is assisted suicide death with dignity? The word ""dignity"" has at least two senses. Proponents, like the one you heard, use the word in an attributed sense to denote the value others confer on them or the value they might even confer upon themselves. But there's a deeper, intrinsic sense of dignity. Human dignity ultimately rests not on a person's interests, but on the value of the person whose interests they are. I don't have to ask you what your preferences are to know that you have dignity. And Ma rtin Luther King says that he learned this from his grandmother who told him, ""Martin, don't let anybody ever tell you that you're not a somebody."" S omebodiness, this intrinsic sense of dignity, was at the heart of our civil rights movement. And the message is that it doesn't matter what a person looks like, how productive that person might be, how others view that person or even how that person may have come to have viewed herself. What matters is that everybody, black or white , sick or well, is a somebody. Now, assisted suicide and euthanasia require us to accept that it is morally permissible to act with the specific intention of making a somebody int o a nobody, to make them dead. Intentions, not just outcomes , matter in ethics. Intending that somebody be turned into a nobody violates the fundamental basis of our interpersonal ethics, our intrinsic dignity. We live in a society that worships independence, youth, and beauty. Yet we know that illness and aging often bring dependence and disfigurement. The terminally ill, especially, need to be reminded of their intrinsic dignity at a time of fierce doubt. They need to know that their ultimate value doesn't depend upon how they look, how productive they are , or their independence. You see, assisted suicide flips the default switch. The question the terminally ill hear, even if never spoken, is ""You've become a burden for you and for us. Why haven't you gotten rid of yourself yet?"" Now, a good utilitarian might think that a proper question, even a moral duty, but as a physician who cares for dying patients , I am much more fearful of the burden this question imposes on the many who might otherwise choose to live , than the modest restriction imposed on a few when assisted sui cide is illegal. Assisted suicide should not be necessary. If it's pain and other symptoms you fear, they can almost always be alleviated. As evidence, consider that pain or other symptoms rarely come up as the reasons for assisted suicide. The top reasons are: fear of being considered a burden and wanting to be in control. Now, you may ask, ""Why shouldn't I have this option?"" and yet we all realize that society puts many restrictions on liberty and for a variety of reasons, to protect others, to promote the common good, to safeguard the bases of morality and law. For example, we don't permit persons to drive drunk or to freely sell themselves into slavery. Paradoxically, in physician assisted suicide and euthanasia, patients turn control over to physicians who assess their eligibility and must provide the means. And, further, since death obliterates all liberty, saying that respect for liberty justifies the obliteration of liberty actually undermines the value that we place on human freed om. Now, Ilora and I live our lives dedicated to supporting patients and families, to listening to patients at the end of life, to relieving suffering, and to valuing them to the end. That's why you shouldn't vote for assisted suicide."
for," Let's be clear what we are debating this evening. It's ""Legalize Assisted Suicide."" It's not ""Put Utilitarianism into Practice,"" and it's also not anything further to do with other areas in which one may or may not think that sometimes death is preferable and ought to be provided. That is not the topic. You're asked to discuss -- to focus only on this quite narrow question. Now, if you think about that question, we are, of course, influenced by the idea that normally death is a bad thing. We often think of it as the very worst thing that can happen to us. But if we ask ourselves why that should be, ""Why is death a bad thing?"" then we can think that the re are a variety of reasons in normal circumstances. For instance, people want to go on living, so death is contrary to that very strong wish that people have. It violates their autonomy. If somebody else in particular kills them, it normally violates their autonomy, which is somet hing that we ought to respect. Secondly, death ends your life, and most of us think of life as a positive, as a good thing, fortunately. So , it prevents you from continuing to live that life that you find worthwhile, that you find fulfilli ng and rich, that brings you happiness and other values. And, thirdly, death is a bad thing for those who love and care for the person who dies. It's a source of grief to them that someone they love dies. So that's why normally, of course, we should not promote death, let alone kill people. But there are very special circumstances in which none of these things apply, and that's what we're talking about tonight. There are circumstances in which the person who is considering death wants to die. That is their autonomous choice. So, death is not a violation of their autonomy, or contrary to their strongest wishes. But it's in accordance with them, as Andrew described in the case of his mother just now. Secondly, there are cases in which a person has no more valuable life to look forward to, valuable by their judgment, not valuable by somebody else's judgment imposing on them the idea that their life is still worthwhile, even though they, having thought the matter through -- perhaps having t hought it through for many years -- again, as in the case Andrew described, have decided that life would not be worth living for them under some circumstances. And in particular, if they have only a short time to live, as in the case of the statutes in Ore gon and Washington, and now Vermont as well, then they know that they cannot look forward to more years of happiness. And as for the grief that those who love them will feel, of course they will feel that grief if they die now. But in the cases covered by these statutes, where people are terminally ill and likely to die -- two doctor s certify that they will die, they have less than six months to live, then the family is going to grieve anyway. And the caring family -- like Andrew and his brother -- will at least feel that the person they love got to die at a time of their own choosing. And that's important. Now, in fact, this idea that this is sometimes a good thing is recognized by our opponents. Daniel Sulmasy just said that sometimes it's justifiable to relieve patients' pain, if you're hastening death. It's not the hastening death that they object to, because they acknowledge that you can withdraw treatment that would keep patients alive -- s ometimes would keep patients alive for a long time. It's the intention of ending a patient's life that they object to. But we don't have to accept that morality. That's a specific morality which Daniel Sulmasy is free to hold, of course. And if he -- as he said at the beginning -- would not like you -- to help you end your life, that's entirely up to him. Nobody is suggesting he should be compelled to end anyone's life against his conscience. But if a different doctor -- and there are such doct ors -- is willing to do that, indeed, thinks that that's the best final care that he can give to a patient who he can no longer restore to a situation that the patient considers worthwhile, then I don't -- I don't think we should be hung up by this idea that something is somehow always a wrongful intention, even if in normal circumstances, to aim at someone's death would be a wrongful intention. But not in these circumstances. In these circumstances, it may be the right intention. Now, I'm sure we're going to hear from probably Ilora Finlay, I guess, that there are risks – that this is a dangerous thing -- that it will lead to a slippery slope. That argument has been around in this debate for a long time. I think that when I fir st became interested in this question -- which now goes back about 40 years. T hat that was an argument that you had to treat very seriously and had to give a lot of weight to. And I could not be completely sure that it was not justified. But no w we have much more experience of the legalization of assisted suicide. We have, in the Netherlands -- in fact, more than 30 years' experience of the open practice of -- by the medical profession, with the support of the Royal Dutch Medical Society -- not against the doctors' views -- of that practice. And with its full legalization, about 14 -- about 12 years ago. And fully supported by the Dutch population, so that although there's been a succession of governments -- some conservative, some more liberal, one of them under a Roman Catholic prime minister -- they have not ever sought to repeal the legislation. And similarly, in Oregon, we now have 17 years of experience, a relatively small number of people dying each year. And as you heard, more of them requesting the prescriptions, but not using them, because they want the control. They want to know that they could end their life if they want to. So, with that experience, the experience of Belgium as well, which followed the Netherlands, its neighbor, and then Luxembourg, and then also Washington -- the state of Washington, the neighbor of Oregon, which was watching what was going on there, and decided that was a good system that they wanted, and therefore accepte d it -- we have not seen a slippery slope here. We have, in fact, found that these -- this legalization is something endorsed by the populations concerned and supported by it, and they want it to continue. "
against," I'm a palliative care physician. For over a quarter of a century, I've looked after dying patients, thousands. I've had countless conversations about death and dying, and supported each in what they tell me they need, not some kind of formula ic death. But I've seen despair return to enjoy life in new found, unexpected andtreasured ways. It is through compassion that I see how dangerous it is to license doctors to provide lethal drugs. How much assistance is needed? Well, euthanasia, as pr acticed in the Netherlands by and large, more than physician -assisted suicide, is the injection of lethal drugs. Here in the U.S., that seems to be reserved for a state execution. It's pretty much the same drugs used. But let me tell you about someone. Let me tell you about David, aged 36. His spinal tumor was causing very difficult pain and incipient paraplegia. His surgeon, oncologist, and family doctor all thought his prognosis was three months. And I was asked to see him only because his doctors couldn't give him a lethal injection. He seemed a very clear- cut case for assisted suicide. When I saw him, the distress was palpable. Their third child was six weeks old. David fitted every criteria of every bit of legislation I have ever seen. He had a clear, settled wish, had mental capacity, was not being coerced and was very, very distressed. It was October. I thought he'd be dead by Christmas. So what happened? After some persuasion, careful, gentle persuasion , he accepted my input. And gradually, he lost the wish to die. 11 years later, he phoned me. His lovely wife had pancreatic cancer and was dying. That baby, now 11, sat with his sister, brother, and dad holding his dying mum's hand. Is David an exception?  He illustrates all the problems with proposals for assisted suicide. Let's look briefly at what happens in states which have changed the law. Over 16 years of Oregon's law, assisted suicides have risen four and a half to fivefold. In Washington state, which legalized assisted suicide in 2008, the rate of rise is fast deeper; 43 percent in one year alone. When you normalize physician-assisted suicide, the underlying social dynamic changes. Laws aren't just regulatory instruments. They send a message. And the message they send is that if you're terminally ill, ending your life is something that you probably ought to think about. Indeed, in Holland, when they changed their law, they thought their figures had plateaued, but they've actually doubled. And in Belgium, the Belgians are quite frank about the fact that they know that somewhere around about half are actually happening outside the law. Changing the law isn't simple and straightforward. So, what are some of the problems? Well, let's look at prognosis. Prognoses are notoriously inaccurate. Even the most expert have a 50/50 chance of being wrong over life expectancy of six months. Oregon's law requires a prognosis of six months or less, ye t two years, nine months from request to death has been recorded. Pathologists tell us that at postmortem, about 1 in 20 are found to have died from something different to the condition they were being treated for. And how real is a settled wish? 40 percent of seriously ill people have some mental disturbance often attributed to the illness or anxiety or treatment. And in 13 to 14 percent, this is a major, treatable depression. Yet Oregon's own research shows a quarter of thos e seeking assisted suicide have depression, which is sometimes missed or overlooked. And research into a sample showed one in six of those given lethally -- lethal drugs legally supplied actually had an undiagnosed, untreated depression. The researchers themselves said the current practice of Death with Dignity Act may not adequately protect all mentally ill patients. Capacity, it has to be situation- specific, decision -specific. How do you assess capacity commensurate with the biggest decision that you could take; that to end your life? Only 6 percent of Oregon's psychiatrists feel confident to do it. Pressures are harder to pick up than depression. Coercion can be subtle, the costs of care, life insurance about to expire or just caregiver fatigue, the person who picks up that their family are stressed and doesn't want to be thought of badly. After all, most parents love their children, but not all children love their parents. And dignity, research has shown that the way that care is deliv ered enhances or undermines dignity. Cicely Saunders of the hospice movement said, ""Dignity is having a sense of personal worth."" Yet in Oregon, 40 percent, and in Washington, 61 percent cite concerns of being a burden, and 80 perc ent are concerned at losing their dignity. Are they being made to feel their lives are an inconvenience to be disposed for the sake of others? And what of doctors? Like it or not, you rely on your doctor. For the doctor under pressure, it is all too easy to give into the pressure to prescribe. Doctors must recognize dying, not impose futile treatments and relieve distress. But I do not think they should be licensed to cut off life by weeks, months or yea rs. Remember David? I saw him last weekend, 23 years on from that first referral. And he said I can tell his story. He brought up the children alone, fantastically well. But what would have happened if his doctor had been able to accede to his request? It is too dangerous to license doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for suicide. Please vote against this utilitarian motion. And it is utilitarian."
for,"Well, I think that actually we send a very dark message to the society at large when we say to people that they don't have the right to make these decisions, when we say to peo ple that we look at their suffering and their anguish, and we refuse to help or support them. I think that sends a social message. I think people have a difficult timespeaking openly and directly to doctors if they know that what they are discussing is illegal, and they don't know what their doctor's legal or ethical position on it is going to be. I think that a shift of this kind always has a range of social consequences, so I cannot say that they don't exist at all, but I would say that to me they are vastly outweighed by the benefits that are gained."
against," Now, I certainly am a supporter of patients' rights. They have the opportunity to refuse all kinds of treatments that we give them. There's no need, for instance, for your mother, Andrew, to have gotten the chemotherapy that she got that was making her sick. All those sorts of choices need to be honored and respected. But it is not the case that suicide is simply a self -regarding act. A psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Ned Cassem, says that when a patient asks about suicide, he begins to ask them, ""In whose closet do you intend to leave your skeleton?"" The sense that it is interpersonal, right, that this is going to be something that is an act of communication to other people, it says something in that sense, it is alwayssomething that impacts other people, and it can't be considered simply a self- regarding act to commit su icide.  "
for,"Look, I do disagree with it. I mean, there's a sense in which none of us is an island and every act could be seen as having some ramifications socially. But this one is one that I think has very few. And I don't think that the implication that if you end your life somehow you've left a skeleton in the closet, that seems nonsense to me. And, after all, you're making a decision, why wouldn't you say the same to the patient who says, ""I don't want any more treatment""? You know, you sa y patients have the right to refuse treatment, you say that Andrew's mother didn't need to have the chemotherapy, but, you know, why wouldn't you say -- why couldn't the doctor say, ""Look, this could keep you alive, maybe even you'll live for ano ther 23 years, who knows?"" like David? You know, you can't exclude it, but you're quite happy to say to people, ""You can refuse treatment, you can withdraw burdensome treatment of va rious kinds -- the doctor can do that, you don't have to accept it,"" so I don't see really there's such a big difference in terms of the ramifications here of , in both cases , a patient's decision not to do what will prolong their life."
against,"They are actually completely different decisions. The person on life support is in a way being held in that state some -- to someone with disease artificially, but that disease is progressing. What you're talking about here is somebody where their disease may stop progressing, they may actually get much better and improve, but you're making a decision to cut their life off deliberately. And so they're dying of that lethal overdo se and they're dying long before they may have died of their disease because you just can't tell. And that's the problem. If you make a decision in life, you must have accurate informat ion. And what I'm saying is, d on't kid yourself that information ab out prognosis is accurate because it isn't."
for,"But why doesn't that apply to a decision to withdraws a ventilator. I mean, have you never seen a patient where a doctor said, ""I think we should take the ventilator away,"" and the patient actually lived quite a lot longer?"
against,"That does happen occasionally, yes, but they are dying of their disease. And you shouldn't be giving people treatments that you think are not achieving a benefit because they're futile. So if the person doesn't want to be -- have a treatment, they can refuse it. Ventilation is a treatment, and if they decide to refuse it, then they can, and I as a doctor must support them. But that is quite different to me, de liberately assisting their suicide because what happens is then you stop actually actively trying to make the day in front of you better than it would have otherwise been -- And even if it 's the role -- No, this -- first of all, that's not what we're saying and that's not a reasonable way to defend the distinction between killing and allowing to die. I think one way of putting the difference, from a moral point of view -- at least from our perspective -- is that treatments can be considered and futile and terminated. But patients should not be considered futile and terminated. And that's the difference, intentionally, in the structure of what we're doi ng, right? So, if somebody's on a ventilator, right? And I stop it, my intention is not that they should be dead. My intention is that they be discontinued from a treatment that I think is needlessly causing suffering, prolonging their dying -- Male Spe aker: But you don't decide. And I am not -- -- I have not -- I have not -- no, they decide whether they go on -- or whether they want to be on it or not. I respect that. But -- John Donvan:But -- but -- -- but if they haven't died -- but if they haven't died, I don't say, ""I failed. Please let me go out and get a pillow to smother them, because my intention has been fulfilled when they -- when the treatment has stopped."" The pa radigm case in this country of terminating life -sustaining treatment is the case of Karen Ann Qu inlan . What did people go to court for? They went to court to discontinue her ventilator. And when -- they were surprised -- -- -- yeah?   Karen Ann Quinlan was a young woman in a vegetative state on a ventilator after partying and overdosing on drugs. And the courts -- the hospital didn't want to discontinue her ventil ator without court justification for that. And what -- the family went to court to do was to say that ""We want the right to be able to discontinue our ventilator."" And I'm totally supportive of that. And that's what they -- -- the judge -- the judges decided this is what would happen. And to their surprise, the woman began breathing when she was disconnected. But what they did was to discontinue a treatment that they thought was futile --John Donvan: Okay. Let me bring it back to Peter Singer. So, what I'm hearing your opponent say, to some degree -- and was also made in the opening statement -- is that -- is that we -- death remains beyond -- beyond our understanding, fully. And then dying remains fully beyond our understanding. And your opponents have come up with several examples of cases where individuals would have lived longer. This is just purely the medical, not even the ethical question now -- that we don't really know what we're doing, and that the odds of killing somebody prematurely are out there."
for,"Look, as Andrew said, you can't say that it will never happen. But is it right to condemn a vastly larger number of people to suffer when they don ’t want to because there may, you know, in one in several thousand cases, perhaps, be somebody like the David and Ilora Finlay described? I don't think so. And I would, again, emphasize, I think the case that Daniel Sulmasy just brought up, with Karen Quinlan, precisely shows that they are making decisions when they withdraw treatment. She lived another nine years. She never recovered consciousness and she died without recovering consciousness. In my view, that was pretty pointless. But if you believe in intrinsic worth of human life, you shouldn't have seen the ventilator as futile, because the ventilator kept her al ive -- was thought to be keeping her alive. And after it was removed, the feeding tubes were keeping her alive. So, was that a good thing? I mean, I don't think it was a good thing, I have to say. But it certainly shows that the decision about withdrawing treatment is just as much a decision that you can get wrong, and you can be dramatically shortening someone's life, as the decision that we're talking about. And let me just add that I have interviewed hundreds of people and he ard stories of thousands more who wanted the option to be able to end their lives. And because they had to deal with the system in which what they were doing was illegal, they felt they had to do it while they still had enough vitality and enough self- control to take the lethal medications that they had been able to obtain. And they, over and over and over and over again, die months or sometimes years earlier than they would otherwise be going to die because they're afraid that they will lose that capacity. And my own mother said she could have lived longer if she hadn't been afraid that those intestinal tumors would make it im possible for her to ingest her --"
against,"But, Andrew, we're talking about physician -assisted suicide in which the patient has to take the medication and -- or the lethal drugs, I would prefer to call them. And that's what they have to do. So that's not consistent. What you're arguing for is euthanasia. And that's not what we're debating tonight. Well, in physician -assisted suicide, the doctor prescribes lethal drugs. The patient has to self -administer. John Donv an: And that's the law in Oregon. And that's the law in Oregon. And they will say, in Oregon, well, if you can't do that, then that's too bad. What you're arguing for is that the doctor injects you with lethal drugs because if you can't ta ke them yourself --"
for,I'm arguing no such thing. My question is whether --
against,But that's what sounded like.
for,"-- the doctor is injecting you. It's a question of whether you'll get into a hospital within which you will not be able to exercise your own volition anymore, because the hospice system can be so controlling and you are so tightly monitored that you lose the capacity to take those drugs. Ilora Finlay:Well, why would you have to kill yourself , because you've got a failure with your healthcare system? I would suggest you need to rectify your healthcare system so people can make choices and control. Excuse me, but the only way to rectify that aspect of the healthcare system would be to give people the capacity to take those drugs under supervision of the healthcare system, which is precisely what you are opposing."
against,"No, absolutely not. I'm afraid I am because I do think that actually in the UK, however much you criticize us, we are not providing the degree of futile overtreatment that people he re seem to be frightened of. And actually -- actually, we are very careful to have conversations with patients about what they want. And advanced care planning is now becoming a standard part of all care for people who have life -limiting illnesses, in terms of what do they want, where do they want to be, what treatments do they not want and so on. So, those discussions are happening a long time before the situation . No, I'm just sort of concerned by the kind of angry tone that's sort of permeating the panel here. You know, I can certainly see -- I can certainly see -- No, no. Yes, yes, yes. It's really -- it's real.  But it's placed -- no, I'm -- I was going to get to that actually. I think that we sort of want to understand what that comes from, and it comes from, I think, the kinds of failures in healthcare systems and the kinds of problems we have in providing exactly the optimal kind of palliative care that's possible. And, you know, I've had plenty of patients who begin their journey at the end of life with me by asking , you know, you've got -- you're going to give me those pills, aren't you doc? And I tell them, ""No, I'm not going to do that. But let's see how things progress in terms of your care. I'm going to be with you. I'm going to care for your pain. I'm going to care for your depression when you're depressed."" It is not natural to be depressed when you're dying. You can be sad, but to have a depression with a capital D is something treatable. And as I follow these patients through to the end of their life, the question never comes up again because they're getting the kind of care that people really want, which respects their dignity, which respects their choices and keeps them pain free. And that's what blunts the kind of, sort of righteous -- righteous anger that I think is justified in those cases where that kind of care isn't provided. John Donvan:All right. Let's hear from Peter Singer."
for,"Yeah, I take it that Ilora Finlay is not denying that in the UK there are re quests for physician -assisted suicide and that indeed there is a movement because you know very well that there is a bill in your own House, the House of Lords, which seemed to make some progress just the other day. And it's also true that there are Briti sh subjects who have traveled from Britain to Switzerland in order to end their life because Switzerland allows nonresidents, unusually, to have assisted suicide, physician -assisted suicide. So it's clearly the case that it's not just the U.S. syste m although, you know, I wish we could just snap our fingers and then we would ha ve a wonderful U.S. health system in which nobody needed to end their life. But it's not an easy task, as President Obama found out, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. S o unfortunately, we're going to have to live and die with the system that we have. But I can't really imagine a system in which -- you know, in the foreseeable future in which there are no serious considered requests for physician -assisted suic ide."
against,"I think it's really important that you talk about the assessments and that everyone's quite clear that not everybody who asks is g etting. That's already been said. So, it isn't about true choice, if you like, because you're not actually choosing. You're making a request to somebody. I think it would be much safer if doctors weren't the gatekeepers here. Were not.John Donvan: Ilora Finlay: Because I think it would be much safer -- and my argument is about public safety -- that you have to produce a report to an independent body who can look at all kinds of things going on. Doctors don't ask you about your personal finances. They're not in the house. They don't have in- depth understanding of the coercive pressures that may be going on at home. But those pressures become important. I have seen families that I thought were loving families, and actually they were hoping somebody w ould die before the life insurance policy ran out. And the other point that I would like to make in all of that is the doctor needs to be looking after the whole family. And don't forget people have children, they have people who they leave behind. What is it like for a teenager, that his love was not enough to sustain his mother through an illness when he desperately wanted her to keep on living and be part of her suicide?"
for,"Well, that's actually been studied in the context of Oregon. They've looked at the families of people who have had physician aid in dying and compared them on various psychological measures with families of people who died of natural causes. And what they found is that there is no difference at all except that the people who had relatives who went through physician aid in dying by and large ha ve a greater acceptance of what has happened and have a grieving process in which they feel there is more coherence. That's what the statistics in Oregon have shown. Well, I think it's terribly important that people have a psychological assessment. When we proposed this, what we proposed is a highly regulated system. And we have many highly regulated systems. In fact, we have a highly regulated syste m for making a decision to discontinue life support. We already have a system for people who don't want to go on living and who have a serious illness. That system in which people have to be shown to be competent, in which they have to be as sessed not to be suffering from a psychiatric illness, in which, if there is any evidence that they might be, they have to undergo treatment before it's determined whether their decision is a fully rational decision is an appropriate set of measures. But we set regulations like that everywhere. I mean, 92 people a day die in traffic accidents in the United States. We don't say, because people are dying in traffic accidents, we should make cars illegal. We say people shouldn't drive over a certain speed limit. They should pay attention to traffic lights. We set a regulatory system in place. And none of us are arguing in favor of an unregulated activity, and none of us are arguing in favor of helping people to die who have got a depression that could be calls to resolve."
against,"Yes, because actually the -- And the problem is that even Charlie Falconer who ’s bill this is said that nothing can be watertight, and that's the problem. If you could come up with a system that was watertight that would be different, but that's not what you've proposed and that's not what we're debating tonight. Sure, I think that it's simply the logic just -- if the justification, as we've heard, is that people have the right to choose, right, then the next step becomes, ""What about that person who is paralyzed and can't actually take the pills?"" So, the justification becomes, ""Well, that's actually discrimination because they actually can't take the pills,"" so we have to move from assisted suicide to euthanasia. Then the next step becomes because the person can't take the -- say that they have the autonomous choice, we can infer that they would and that we would have what's called ""non -voluntary euthanasia,"" not ""involuntary"" but ""non- voluntary"" in which we, like we do for withholdi ng/withdrawing life sustaining treatments, say that people who are demented can have the family say that the treatment can be discontinued. And all of this has actually happened in the Netherlands already. So, if you want to sort of say that this can't happen, we've moved from a period in the Netherlands in which first of all it was legal -- illegal but tolerated, then to being something that was legal for persons who were autonomous and could ask for it, then it's moved on actually to children -- there's a grown again protocol for infanticide of children under the euthanasia law there -- psychiatric indications of people who feel that their psychiatric illness is insufficiently treated can ask for it and get it under those -- No, not at all, because you've got no way of detecting abuse, and actually if you talk to the campaign organizations in Oregon they actually are wanting to campaign eventually for it to just be a pill that you can have without having to see the doctor and go through all that. If you look at the Netherlands, they started off having physician assisted suicide and euthanasia. But actually it was more convenient for the doctors because it didn't take so long, so they would go down -- they pushed it down the euthanasia route. That was a -- in --"
for,"No, that was just not true, sorry. There was never a case when physician assisted suicide -- -- was legal or accepted and euthanasia was not. But that's --"
against,"-- no, no, they --"
for,"-- they just didn't see that distinction. Ilora Finlay:-- they didn't see that distinction, but they're now using euthanasia more , and also the --complications that arose with physician -assisted suicide, because of vomiting, and nausea, and so on. They've gone over to injec ting drugs in --"
against," P eter Singer : That's really not right. In Belgium, they've extended it, so now you have somebody who had euthanasia because he had a botched sex change operation. There's been approval for a prisoner who wants to have euthanasia because he doesn't want to carry on living in prison, and so on. So, it's not a slippery slope down, but it's an incremental extension that we're seeing, where the law can change.  Again, l et me first say, in response to the first part of your question, that the excruciating pain that you're talking about is nothing that Ilora or I would support that patients have to go through. What we're -- we are totally in support of treating patients' pain, even to the point that it might hasten their death. And so, there's no need -- if people think they need assisted suicide in order to avoid pain, that's not the issue here. That's not even why people in Oregon say they're taking the pills, right? It's not because of pain, because we can take care of that, even to the point of rendering somebody to be unconscious. What we're talking about is the kind of world we want to live in, one in which we can say that -- to a person that the fact that you think that you are a burden is sufficient to be able to end your own life, and that we would have an atmosphere in which that kind of judgment could be made by people -- I think is a problematic world to live in.  Thank you for that question. You -- all the patients I look after have got an incurable illness. They all have progressive illness. And they all have illness that is -- working towards their death and they're likely to die from. What I'm saying is that yo u can't be certain. And I am supporting them while they go through that phase of their lives, helping them reframe their experience, and doing everything I can to improve quality of life. Let me tell you one story. A woman who was desperate to be taken off her ventilator, but wanted a lethal overdose -- her husband was very angry that we weren't giving her a lethal overdose. One morning, I persuaded him t o go out to t he pub for a drink , let me have half an hour in with her, which I did. In that tim e, I asked her, ""What's the worst thing for you at the moment?"" And she said it was the whiskers on her chin. And I said to her, ""Would you like me to give you a quick facial?"" Now, I've never been trained to do it, but we found some tweezers and one of the nurses came and helped me. And she did indeed have some quite long whiskers on her chin, and we plucked them out. And the nurse said, ""Do you want to be made up again?"" And she said, ""Yes."" We made her up. And her comment was, when we showed her in the mirror, she said, ""I feel like a woman again."" And from that point on, she never asked for lethal overdoses, but she asked to be made up every day.  Because she realized that she could be a woman again and have personal worth. But m y argument is that this motion comes from despair, from seeing that there is no worth left in a human being once they're ill and once they appear to be dying. But you just can't tell. And I want doctors to have to strive to improve quality of life. And that is why I oppose this motion."
for,"I find it a very sad story, actually, that that was so important to that woman, that sense of being a woman. "
against,You've got whiskers on your chin all the time. I'm afraid I would like mine plucked.
for," But -- and I think in a way it's trivializing the reasons why people ask for physician assistance i n dying. It's things like being nauseous, feeling breathless, being -- just being able to lie there and not being able to do anything. I mean, it may be that pain can generally be controlled, or I've certainly read palliative care specialists who acknowledge that it can in every case, except as Daniel Sulmasy just said, by making the patient unconscious. But, you know, that then is getting, I think, very close to what we're talking about. I've seen surveys that say that the majority of American intensive care specialists have u sed terminal sedation, that is they sedate the patient to the point of unconsciousness. The patient, of course, then does not eat, and they don't tube feed the person, so the patient then dies. I mean, what's the difference between giving the patient so many drugs that they're unconscious and then they're not fed and they die, or allowing them to take a drug which, at their choice and at their time, will end their life? And I would just add that -- I will quickly. First to say that I t hink we're all agreed that compassionate medical care is to the good and that anyone who can find meaning in life or can be helped to find meaning in life should be encouraged to do so and receive every possible support. But I -- A ndrew Solomon: But I think, in keeping with what Peter has just said, that there are a great many people exploring a great many means to bring these ends to their lives. There are people who are shooting themselves in houses by themselves because this is unavailable. There are people who take this medication, someone I interviewed recently was the wife of someone who had managed to get medication and took it and vomited and knew he couldn't get another prescription and had to eat his vomit in order to ens ure that he came to an end. There is back alley euthanasia going on in various ways, and it is uncontrolled and unregulated. And if it were legalized, it could be brought more into control."
against,"Actually, even under legalized assisted suicide, much of what you have described still happens. Patients often vomit. In fact, if you read ""Final Exit"" from Derek Humphrey,he su gge sts putting a plastic bag over your head to make sure that the vomitous doesn't get onto the bed and that you actually suffocate afterwards if the drugs haven't worked. And there are suicide s that don't work even under those --"
for,"No, I don't think we're asking them to risk their integrity -- -- we're asking them to act with integrity, to consider carefully whether the circumstances are the ones that are prescribed in the law, as we said, could be -- have various kinds of safeguards and reviews, and will minimize those kinds of mistakes. It is true that physicians, like everyone else, are fallible, and it is true that occasionally there may be a mistake, and it may be that somebody could have lived longer and even found their life worthwhile. We're not saying that that can never happen, because we know that in all human things, things could askew occasionally. But we don't think these rare possible cases are sufficient t o say that nobody else can have these choice, nobody else can make this decision that ""I've had enough,"" and that because of these very occasional mistakes, everybody else has to suffer through to the end whether they want to do that or not."
against," Again, first of all, I'm not a vitalist. I don't think that life itself is the value here. And secondly, that I've suggested several times here that the person who is in the kind of excruciating pain you're talking about, under my care or Dr. Finlay's care, would be able to get increasing doses o f morphine until the point that their pain was relieved, whether that hastened their death or not. My aim there is not to eliminate the patient, but to eliminate the patient's pain. And I foresee the possibility that this could happen, but that's not my aim. What I want to do is reverence people, right, and not act with the specific intention of making them dead, of turning a somebody into a nobody. I want to eliminate pain where I can. And if it takes making them unconscious in order to do that, I'm willing to do it.  Can I answer? Because you've asked a practical question. I've seen patients whose pain score was 11 out of 10, not just 10 out of 10. I have sat there with a syringe full of Diamorphine and injected slowly, milligram by milligram, minute by minute until the ir pain score is down and it is bearable, until we get it under control and redouble the efforts. And sometimes the person has seemed a bit sleepy for a time and we've had side effects and we've had to get over them. But my role as a doctor is to relieve that suffering. Those patients may say, ""I can't bear this, I ought to be dead,"" but that does not continue, that request does not continue when you get on top of their symptoms. I've had conversations with hundreds of patients about how they feel, about what's happening to them, many people are devastated when they first realize that they have a life threatening illness. The world is not as they thought it was going to be. But actually when you work with them, and it is hard work, they come through an d they often have a fulfillment that they never imagined they could have before. I've had people who've wanted theoretically to have assisted suicide or euthanasia, but they've abandoned that when they themselves are ill."
for,That's not the question. You both evaded the question. The question asked you to accept -- -- the hypothesis that you can't relieve the excruciating pain. It's an attempt to understand your underlying philosophical or ethical position. And neither of you -- you've both just evaded that question.
against,"No, because I don't accept -- -- no, there's a fundamental premise here and a misunderstanding. Those of us that actually are the ones with the drugs and the techniques to relieve the pain keep on trying and going back and back and back again, so you're painting a hypothetical question, I'm saying I faced it practically and I still oppose physician assisted suicide."
for," It's easier. We want you to support this motion because, firstly, we believe that people should be the ones to decide for themselves whether they think that continued life is worthwhile for them or not. We don't think that it should be up to anybody else to say, ""We think your life is worthwhile."" And, secondly, we think that there is a lot of unnecessarysuffering, whether it's excruciating pain or not, there is suffering and distress of various sorts which continues and is going to continue for the foreseeable future in this system and it could be re lieved by a relatively simple legi slative reform that exists already and has been shown to work. Now, in fact, this region today took a little step closer to that. You may not know that the New Jersey State Assembly today voted to pass the Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act which is similar to the other legislation that we've been discussing. It voted 41 to 31, so a fairly clear majority. It still, of course, has to go to the Senate, and then it would need the assent of a candidate -- a governor who wishes to be the Republican candidate for the presidency -- -- so it still has some way to go. But I just want to quote one of the supporters of that whose name is Janet Colbert. She's a retired oncolo gy nurse, so she knows a lot about cancer and about people dying from cancer. She now herself has terminal liver cancer, but she supports this because she said, ""As I battle my illness I would like the choice and comfort that comes with the option of aid in dying."" That's all we're asking for. "
against,"You know, I get questions frequently from patients who ask how I can be opposed to assisted suicide when they're getting sick from their chemotherapy, suffering complications from the big IV they've got stuck in their neck, are depressed and in pain, and spending more time in the hospital than outside it. So, I ask them, ""Why are you still getting chemotherapy? Why have you got that big IV stuck in your neck? Why not ask for hospice to help treat your pain and your depression? Why go to the hospital? Supporters of assisted suicide want -- our opponents want respect for their dignity and attention to their individual needs. But we're al l human. We're fragile, interdependent,connected in bonds of mutual respect and support. Suicide is always interpersonal. It's an act of communication. Many persons who raise the question of assisted suicide are doing so because they're really testing the waters. They are asking us if we care enough to try to stop them. And when we don't stop them, we confirm their deepest fears and make it difficult for them to see an alternative. And if the suicide happens, their physicians and families must w restle with it the rest of their lives. We shouldn't be about constructing a society that makes assisted suicide routine. Rather, we should redirect our energies towards making sure that all patients get the kind of care that I think we all want, helping a ll of us to live to the fullness -- to the fullest, even as we're dying. So, I want you to vote for that kind of high- quality compassionate care at the end of life, and for the sort of ethical world that really makes that possible by voting no on assisted suicide."
for,"I take exception to the idea that all pain is treatable. It's not true to clinical data and it's not true to personal experience. And I also take exception to the idea that we value life by insisting that somebody -- to borrow your phrase ""not become a nobody."" That can be care, but it can also be oppressive. Rilke wrote, ""We need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go, for holding on comes naturally. We do not need to learn it. ” Death is not only the start of nothing, but also the end of everything. And it's important that it keeps faith with the way that someone has lived. Nothing so resembles a person in his biography, as the manner of his or her death. The finale is wh at makes sense of the symphony. Simone de Beauvoir's mother begged her for help when she was sick, and Simone de Beauvoir instead took the word of her doctors. And afterwards, she wrote, ""Beaten by the ethics of society, I had abjured my own. ” One is caught up in the wheels and dragged along, powerless in the face of specialist diagnoses that forecast their decisions. A race had begun between death andtorture. I asked myself how one manages to go on living when someone you love has called out to you in vain? Let us not treat those we love with that pusillanimous disregard. Let us not institutionalize and enshrine in law prohibitions that force us to suffer contrary to our beliefs and force us to watch those we love suffer c ontrary to their expressed wishes."
against,"It's all too easy to be swayed by emotion and fear. But human beings are uniquely interconnected. If I accede to the request to provide lethal drugs, I actually give the message, ""Yeah, I think yo u're right. You'd be better off dead."" I don't give the message that you are of worth. I've been there myself. My own mum was in hospice dying, angry, terribly angry that I was opposing the assisted suicide that she wanted. She thought it was the answer. T his fiercely independent lady dreaded dependence. It broke my heart, and I was torn apart by it. An argument about philosophy with a member of staff let her see that her mind still worked, and she still had something to offer. So, she battled with us, all of us, and then went home, to everyone's surprise. She didn't die. She lived four more years. And in those four years, she saw her two great grandsons born. And she said they were the richest years of her life. They were i mportant to her. They were important to us all, everyone, in the family. I beg you, it's not like in the movie. Assisted suicide isn't straightforward and clean and quick. Some people awake. Six did in Oregon. Some people take a long time to die, up to 104 hours. That's not dignified. Don't vote for this dangerous, dangerous law that actually deprives people of the possibility of having their dignity and having doctors who have to work to improve their quality of life. This law allows them to throw the towel in."
