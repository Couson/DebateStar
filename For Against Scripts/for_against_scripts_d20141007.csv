for,"No, we're still Verizon customers . And I don't think we'd escape the NSA that easily .

You know, I don't know if it's because I was christened on the 4th of July in a bicentennial year or maybe my mother read a lot of American history while she was pregnant with me, but since birth, I've always been very inspired by the work of those framer guys.

for,"Thank you, John. I'm honored to be here tonight to discuss the mass collection of Americans' phone records . But before I get into the program, I think it's critical to recognize that tonight's debate is not just about phone records and is not just about the NSA. This is a debate about the kind of society we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country in which our government routinely spies on hundreds of millions of Americans who have done nothing wrong ? Or do we prefer to live in a country that's true to our vision, to the vision of our nation's founders, who believe that the government should, as a ge neral matter, leave us alone unless it has cause to invade our privacy ? I think our founders got it right, and I hope you'll agree, which is why you should vote for the resolution, mass collection of our phone records violates the fourth amendment . Here is what it looks like to live in a society of mass surveillance . Every time you place or receive a call the government knows who you talked to, when the call started and how long it lasted . The government knows every time you called your doc tor and which doctor you called, which family members you stay in touch with and which you don't, and which pastor, rabb i or imam you talked to and for how long you spoke . The government knows whether, how often and precisely when you called the abortion clinic, the local Alcoholics Anonymous, your psychiatrist, your ex -boyfriend, a criminal defense attorney or the suicide hotline . If you called someone today, by tomorrow morning, the government will have a record of that call. It will keep that record for the next five years . And it is doing the same for every one of your calls and every one of the calls of millions of other innocent Americans . This program is the most sweeping surveillance operation ever undertaken in the United States . And it is unconstitutional for the simple reason that the Fourth Amendment does not allow dragnet surveillance . As my partner, Elizabeth, will explain in a few minutes, dragnet surveillance in fact was the principal evil that the Fourth Amendment was designed to prevent, and for good reason . Dragnet surveillance intrudes on the most fundamental of liberties in a free and democratic society: to be left alone by our government, absent good cause . The phone records program breaks that promise . It places the entire country under surveillance without any suspicion . It threatens our ability to communicate freely without having to worry that the government is looking over our shoulder s. It discourages journalist s’ sources from coming forward, knowing as they now do that every -- every one of their calls is being documented in a government database . And it causes ordinary Americans to hesitate before calling individuals or organizatio ns that they would rather not have as a part of their permanent record on file with the NSA . Now, our opponents will attempt to minimize the NSA program's intrusiveness and exaggerate its effectiveness . They'll argue that the Fourth Amendment does not pr otect our phone records, that there are protections in place for our privacy under the program and that the program is necessary for our national security . All of those arguments are wrong . First, our phone records, especially when they're collected in b ulk, are extraordinarily sensitive . They reveal all of your associations, personal, professional, medical, all of them. In fact, your phone records can be every bit as sensitive as the content of your phone calls . If you call someone other than your spouse routinely at 1:00 in the morning, you don't have to know what's said in order to know what's going on. And if a government employee calls a reporter a dozen times before news breaks of an illegal government operation, again, the call patt ern tells the story. Our phone records are, in other words, a proxy for the content of our calls . Our opponents will say that the Supreme Court has already decided that phone records are not protected by the Constitution. This argument is based on a Supreme Court case from 1979 called Smith vs . Maryland . But that case involved collection for several days of an individual criminal suspect's phonerecords . The NSA's program, in contrast, involves the indefinite surveillance of millions of innocent Ameri cans. Our opponents will say that these differences don't matter . But it's truly bizarre to define the boundaries of privacy in the digital age on the basis of a legal opinion issued before the internet as we know it was created, an opinion that many Supreme Court justices have already said is ill suited to the digital era. Second, the privacy protections that our opponents will focus on are a red herring . Those restrictions are weak . They can be violated, and they already have been thousa nds of times . But more importantly, under our opponents' theory, the Constitution simply does not apply to our phone records . This means that the government could collect them without any of the supposed privacy protections that they will describe . Another fatal flaw in this argument is that the government's collection of our phone records violates our privacy even if there are restrictions in place for their later use . The collection itself is a violation . For that reason, we don't let the NSA keep a copy of every single email sent in the country so long as there are protections in place on the back end . And we don't allow the NSA to put a video camera in our bedrooms so long as it promises not to press play unless it has a good enough reason. Third, bulk collection has not made us any safer . Virtually every independent review of the NSA's phone records program has concluded that it hadn't stopped any terrorist attacks and that the government can track down terrorists without bulk collect ion by issuing targeted requests to the phone companies . A congressional review group said this: That after studying the NSA's classified evidence, it could not, quote, ""Identify a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the tele phone records program made a concrete difference."" A separate presidential group came to the same conclusion, and the president himself has now agreed . One final point: Tonight's resolution is focused on phone records . But don't be fooled . The consequences are much, much broader . If the Fourth Amendment permits the bulk collection of our phone records, then it would permit the bulk collection of other similar records . The problem is that virtually everything we do today leaves a digital trail of some sort . Whenever you send an email, visit a website, use your credit card or even just walk around with your phone turned on, you are leaving a rich trail of d igital bread crumbs in your wake . The arguments our opponents will make tonight would expose all of that information to routine, bulk collection by the government. That's not the world that our framers envisioned when they drafted the Fourth Amendment, and it's not the world that you should accept . You should vote for themotion, the mass collection of our phone records violates the Fourth Amendment. Thank you."
against,"Thank y ou. It's really a pleasure to be here for the Intelligence Squared Debate . These are among the most civil and thoughtful public engagements on issues that I'm familiar with in the current world and a world where civility is often in short supply . So, it's a pleasure to be here. But I have to say that while Alex has anticipated some of my arguments, he's left a few things out. The question that we're debating is a question of law . Does the Fourth Amendment -- is the Fourth Amendment violated by mass collection of phone records? And what he glided over was the fact that the Supreme Court has decided this . If this were a true and false question on a constitutional law exam and you said, ""Yes, the Fourth Amendment is violated by that, "" you'd get a D because the Supreme Court has decided that these are records that are not protected by the Fourth Amendment because of what Ben Franklin said, If you give away your secrets, they're not yours anymore . Other people get a say in them, and it's not a search when those people make those secrets available. So, that is the state of the doctrine . What Alex said is essentially he doesn't like it, he wants you not to like it . But it is the Supreme Court's law ruling . And of the 20 judges that have been asked to evaluate the argument that Alex made that somehow the passage of time and the adoption of the Internet means that this case is no longer applicable to a mass collection of data, 20 judges have looked at that and 19 of them h ave rejected Alex's argument . He's got one judge who said, ""Yeah, I would just as soon overrule the Supreme Court."" But district court judges don't ordinarily get to do that . So, the answer to the question I think, and what I hope youwill ultimately de cide, is that the Fourth Amendment is not violated by this . But there's a second aspect of this that I do want to get to, which is you're probably asking, ""Yeah, but can that be -- really be the right result?"" And I want to address that because in the en d, if you decide -- even if you decide that taking these records is an event that implicates a reasonable expectation of privacy, the question is ""Is it reasonable for the government to have done what they did?"" And for that I think we ought to address the question of why the government did this . The biggest terrorist threat we face is some terrorist group, well organized, well- armed, with a safe haven that -- where they can bring people with clean passports together, recruit them, train them, finance them, and then send them into the United States to carry out a coordinated attack without any warning, it's almost impossible for us to catch those plots as they're being trained if there truly is a safe haven. So, our best hope for catching those plotters is that they will have to coordinate, probably by phone, inside the United States and perhaps with their trainers and recruiters back in the Middle East . And if we can catch those calls back to the Middle East and then tie them up to the calls that, that person has made inside the United States, we have at least a fighting chance to roll up that attack before it occurs . That's what happened in 9/11. We missed that opportunity . And that's what this program was designed to deal with . They can't, however, pursue the idea that Alex has been offering : go to each of the phone companies and say, ""Do you have anybody who called these numbers?"" Give every phone company in America a list of the most sensitive targets, all the terrorist numbers we know in the world, and make sure that they hold those in confidence . Very difficult to do, and then once you try to find somebody in the United States by matching up their calls, once you get past the first hop to the first person, and you're looking to see whether he had sensitive conversations, you're going back to every phone company in America and asking them about those calls . This is a nightmare . The only way you can actually do this as fast as the terrorists can carry out their plot is if you have them in one place where you can search the m. And that is what the government tried to do . They put them in one place so that they could search them . That's a collection . Alex says that fact alone made it unconstitutional and that we're somehow -- NSA knows when you ca ll your girlfriend at 1:00 in the morning . But the fact is it does us no great harm if all that record is sitting on a hard drive in a safe somewhere and nobody has actually opened up those records to look at . And that's what the government did. They pu t the protections for privacynot on the collection but on the question of ""What are we goi ng to search?"" And they said, y ou can't search without a good reason for searching, a reasonable, articulable suspicion, limited people who can do it, lots of audits, no number -- no names in this database, only numbers -- and the number of searches that were performed on an annual basis was about 300 . Out of that, they found some suspicious patterns . And they referred those -- about 500 a year -- to the FBI to find out who these people are and what they're doing . That's the extent of the government's intrusion into privacy , at a time when about a million records are gathered under criminal subpoena. So, we have a choice . We can either say, “No, the government can never do that because it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment,” or we can say, “We want to allow that t o happen, but with privacy safeguards.” I think the choice, especially at a time when suddenly we have a terrorist group that does have a safe haven, the choice is to choose privacy and security . Thank you."
for,"Thank you so much . Thank you so much, John. It's great to be here tonight. Now, Stewart certainly presents a frightening picture of terrorists working here in the United States . But he presents a false choice between the idea of securing our nation and remaining faithful to the fundamental values that our nation holds dear, as expressed in the Constitution and, relevant to tonight, the Fourth Amendment. We can do both. As my partner Alex has ably explained, the NSA has not established that its massive intrusion into the lives of everyday Americans is necessary in order to keep us safe . But while this dragnet surveillance program has not been established as necessary, theimportance of protecting against such suspicionless, sweeping searches, as those conducted by the NSA , is established in our Constitutional tradition beyond question. Intrusive searches like the one being conducted every day by the NSA strikes at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment was enacted to prevent . It gets to the very heart of why our nation's founders were willing to lay down their lives if they had to in order to protect the liberty, security, and personal privacy of Americans . So, as you listen to our debate tonight, I would ask you to keep in mi nd the vision and the values of our founders . The reasons why they wrote into our Constitution the Fourth Amendment in the first place -- keep that as your North Star tonight. When the founding fathers drafted the Fourth Amendment, the mischief to which they were responding was principally the British use of general warra nts and writs of assistance. B roadly authorized searche s that allowed British officers to go into the homes of American colonists without any particularized suspicion of wrong doing. And they were used broadly in the hope that if they went through enough people's stuff, they would find something that would show evidence of wrongdoing . Now, that sounds a little familiar to me today . These generalized searches back then were decrie d as instruments of arbitrary power. They were used to silence critics of the crown and to trample the personal liberty of the American colonists . In fact, American colonists' opposition to these sorts of generalized searches was, as Chief Justice Roberts explained in a recent Supreme Court decision on behalf of all nine justices on the court, applying robust Fourth Amendment protections to the searches of cell phones , t he opposition to these sorts of warrantless, generalized searches was one of the driving forces behind the Revolution itself. To illustrate, the Chief Justice recounted a famous speech given in 1760s Boston by the patriot James Otis, denouncing the use of warrantless searches, generalized searches without individualized suspicion , that invaded American colonists ’ privacy without probable cause . One young man listening in the audience that day was none other than John Adams . And recounting Otis' s speech and the day, Adams described it later as, “the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain.” Then and there the child independence was born. The need to get a warrant to have reasonable suspicion before invading someone's privacy, that wasn't a mere technicality, something on a checklist that you have to go through that slows down good law enforcement, something that the guys on “ Law and Order” sort of get past with a wink and a nod. It was somethi ng that was so important to our founders that it was an essential part of the struggle for independence . We are no longer in that first act of the great American story, and we are fortunate that we have to guide us today the wisdom and the words of the Co nstitution. James Otis in the 1760s didn't have the Fourth Amendment to back up his arguments, but fortunately, Alex and I do tonight. The text of the Fourth Amendment, which you've seen on the screens, declares the right of the people to be free from un reasonable searches . And it tells the government that it needs to have probable cause before it wants to invade our privacy . The detailed text enshrines a specific prohibition, something that's rather unusual in the Constitution, which often speaks in br oader terms, a specific prohibition against the types of suspicion- less searches that the NSA is conducting every day on Americans -- sweeping searches and surveillance of very private information without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . And the wisdom of our founders applies just as much today as it did in the 18th century . I think those framer guys still have a lot to tell us about what kind of society we want to live in, as Alex said . Just because the sensitive private information that we hold -- that we hold dear today can be gleaned remotely and electronically rather than having a British red coat break the padlock on our leather trunk and our cute brick colonial in Boston, as Chief Justice Roberts said, that does not make that information any less worthy of the protection that the founders fought for . Now, the other side will try to say that there isn’t a search or there is some exception that makes it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. But I would submit that any exception to the Fourth Amendment that allows the government to collect data that can reveal sensitive, deeply private information about every American citizen without any suspicion that we are engaged in real wrongdoing. A ny exception to the amendment that allows that would swallow this most important protection in the Constitution, something that was so important to our founders that it breathed a spark to the fire of revolution. So, if you keep as your north st ar those founders, I trust that you will vote for the proposition that mass collection of Americans' private records violates the Fourth Amendment . Thank you."
against,"Thank you very much for that invitation. And it's a real pleasure to return to National Constitution Center. I'd like to thank Jeff Rosen, an old college and law school friend of mine and now the president of this wonderful center, and our worthy opponents, who have the misfortune of not being from our great home city of Philadelphia and so are destined to lose; and my co -arguer, Stewart Baker, and also the Rosen kranz' s family I've known for quite some time . It's a real pleasure to be here under their support. None of that comes out of my time for the debate. So -- and I still want to say, it's very likely that I personally be the worst debater because I'm used to sitting in a faculty lounge and not speaking within a six -minute window . In my classes, it takes about six minutes for me to figure out what cases are being covered in the class that I'm c ertainly standing in. So , I apologize if I don't get to all my points . And I don't -- as I'm amazed, my colleagues all did finish exactly at 00 :00 . I was quite impressed . But I want to make just make two important poi nts -- three important points . See, I already started . One, from the -- what you heard from the other side, you would think that the government was just interested in collecting information about all of us because they're just interested in collecting information about all of us . 19:07 :13 The most important point is that there's a reason why the government created these programs . It's the one that was present when I was in the government on 9/11 itself and the reason I was -- one of the first things I had to do in the Justice Department was to pass on the legality of what became the surveillance programs . And the reason why is that if you look at the text of the Fourth Amendment, it says we have a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Much of what Ms . Wydra had to say was about British general warrants and when you get a warrant from a judge, they conduct asearch of our houses . I think that's an entirely different question than when the government can institute a broad program that doesn't look at the co ntent of our communications, just looks at the addressing information and the phone numbers and whether it can do that, whether it's a reasonable search given the circumstances . That's how the Supreme Court’ s interpreted the language, and that's how we should . And those reasonable circumstances, it seems to me, as my co -panelists argued, on 9/11, we were attacked by a different kind of enemy, not a foreign country, but an enemy that hides and disguises itself as normal civilians , that commun icates using normal civilian communication methods like the internet and phone calls to launch surprise attacks with devastating effect on our cities, with a goal of killing as many civilians as possible . After 9/11, confronted by this problem, this challenge, we decided this would be a reasonable thing to do to try to find any more terrorists coming to the United States by looking at phone numbers of people from abroad calling into the United States and what those phone numbers called, to try to de tect p atterns of enemy agents trying to infiltrate into the United States . That's the purpose of the program . And I vigorously deny any idea that this is just part of some government dragnet because the government just likes to collect information about all of us just for the fun of it . The government did not do it for that reason, and I was present at that time, and the reason we did it is because we were suffering from the 9/11 attacks . Second point, I want to just point out, I'm sure that our debate opponents are not often compared to conservatives, but they are as the bed fellows of Robert Bork, because what they have done is said, “ I don't care what prece dence says. I have discerned the principle of the framers, and I am going to impose it over the democratic choices that we have made in our society today . Throw out Smith vs . Maryland, the governing Supreme Court precedent in this area which every lower court judge to examine this program and similar programs has used as a governing law . Throw out the fact that every federal judge to examine these programs at the appellate level and almost all them at district court level have approved this . Throw out that the president has approv ed it, the Congress has approved it, and the spec ial FISA court made by federal judges has approved it under the Smith vs . Maryland idea. Instead, from the phrases in the Fourth Amendment, I am going to discern this overriding principle that will be imposed on our society .” Now, how do they know that the text the Fourth Amendment knows this ? We have so many debates in constitutionallaw . Nick Rosenkranz and Jeff Rosen, who you just heard from in the beginning, they can spend six hours argu ing about the meaning of the word ""the"" in the Constitution. You probably just saw a little bit of it at the beginning . How do they know that the framers would have disapproved of a collection program that collected phone numbers; didn't listen in on the conversations themselves, but only collected the phone numbers ? When people, judges, lawyers who've devoted their lives to trying to figure out what the Constitution means have almost unanimously agreed in their written decisions to appro ve the c onstitutionality of this program. So, if anyone's the radicals here, it's the people on the other side, Ms . Wydra, Ms. Abdo -- Mr . Abdo, who want to throw out all those decades of cases governing in favor of their understandi ng of the Constitution. But suppose you disagree with the Supreme Court, what should you do ? Maybe I, as a policy matter, would draw the line between security and privacy somewhere else . We should decide it the way we decide most of the que stions in our society. We have elections . If you don't like the line that the government has drawn, elect a president and Congress who would draw it differently . This is not a question, I think, as a democracy, that we should leave up to five -- no offe nse to the retired people in the audience -- super annuated elderly people on the Supreme Court, probabl y don't know how cell phone or smartphone really works; I'm sure have no Facebook or Twitter accounts to let you know about their latest opinions . And so if you really want to change the law here and change what the government does, elect different people to Congress. Elect Rand Paul to president . Put -- have them put into effect the policies that we want . But that's how our Constitution is designed to work. So , if John keeps a diary and the police want it, if they come into his house and take it, that's a search . If he gives it to his mom and she takes it home and the police come and knock on her door and say, ""Would you give us a copy of John's diary?"" that's not a search . What the government has done here is they have gone to people to whom these records have been given by the peopl e who made the phone calls. We all know the phone company needs to know what numbers we're dialing in order to deliver the call to the right place . So , we have shared this information already . We can't expect to be able to claim a property right against search, wherev er that information was. The Supreme Court's decision essential ly stood for the proposition that you have a much diminished expectation of privacy once you knowingly shared information with someone else, especially if the government gets it from that person."
for,"I think that's part of the change . The other part of the change before -- and if I can say before answering your question -- is that it is now not really possible to meaningfully participate in society without using the communications platforms that all of the tech companies have brought to us . And so, it's necessary to, as Stewart would say, share this information . But it's not of that same voluntary nature that I think our opponents rely on."
against,"Yea h. I think we ought to be caution of these efforts to claim, just because some new technology came along, we have to throw out all the rules that we've had before and replace it with some uniform, general, radical, simple rule . Life is not that easy, and life is not that simple, especially when the technology is so new . We need to learn more about how all these technologies work, how they interface with law enforcement . Then, slowly, incrementally, we should be making decisions of what the best rules are rather than just saying, “Oh, because automobiles have come along, we can throw out all the rules about horse accidents because those were horses and these are cars.” Instead, we should try to analogize from the things that came before using common sense . That what the Constitution seems to say when it says “reasonable searches and seizures.”"
for,"Well, you know, John mentioned in his remarks, he said that he didn't want to leave these decisions to, you know, five old guys on the Supreme Court. But I'm sorry to say that you're behind the times of nine justices on the Supreme Court, however old they are, because just a few months ago at the end of last term, a unanimous Supreme Court told us that digital is different in a case that applied the Fourth Amendment to S martphones. Well, you know, I think there's a great analogy that Chief Justice Roberts used. He said that, “Saying that a ride on a horse a nd buggy is the same as taking a rocket ship to the moon makes about as much sense as using some of these old precedents and rules when applied to the digital age, because the type, the quantity, and quality of information that can be gained in the digital age is just so different that it actually makes a real difference to the Fourth Amendment. So before, when you would have this information that was available to the public, it was sort of a random tile that could give you a very small glimpse into a person's life. But because of the quantity of data that can be accessed very easily -- this came up in a case about GPS locators -- it adds up to a mosaic that provides a rather clear picture of a person's life in a way that you couldn't in a pre -digital age. With a semicolon, maybe. John Donvan:Stewart Baker."
against,"So, the one thing that we're acting as though is though if we don't have the Supreme Court ride to our rescue, all of this data is suddenly going to be available to the government under no restrictions whatsoever . Since Smith against Maryland was decided, Congress has enacted and amended the rules on electronic searches four or five times . We can rely on democracy to make these decisions . The average age, by the way, of a Supreme Court -- 70 years . You know, I don't know about you; I am a boomer and I'm sick of having boomers make these decisions . There's no reason why we should ask the Supreme Court -- Yes . My argument is we should not turn -- right now, these records are not subject to Fourth Amendment analysis under Smith against Maryland . The argument is, “Well, that's going to open us all in a digital age to --” Yeah, I can do it. So, in Smith against Maryland, the cops were investigating calls to a woman -- harassing calls to a woman . They got a pen register on a suspect's phone. A pen register records all the numbers that he dials.John Donvan: And it does it down at the phone company. Down at the phone company . And essentially, they had c all data records on this guy for several days until they realized yes, he's making the bad calls. And the court said yeah -- John Donvan: And the court said, “Well, when you dial a phone number, that's not a secret because you just dialed it . You put it out into the world.” Okay . So, that's what the court is using now to say that the metadata is not a secret. Do I have that pretty much nailed,"
for,"And something that, P rofessor Yoo said as well, which is that we shouldn't trust courts to safeguard our individual rights . And I think that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about what the Bill of Rights is about. The Bill of Rights was designed to withdraw from political the majorities the decisions that affect the individual rights of people who can't protect themselves through political constitue ncies. It was precisely for that purpose that the Constitution and our framers placed those decisions in unelected, tenure -protected judges so that they could safeguard individual rights . And so I think the wrong answer is to say we should l eave our individual rights to Congress, particularly this Congress or the next.John Donvan: John Yoo, do you want to respond to that?"
against,"As I often say, you know, nothing the opponents could say would be as mean as what my Korean mother would say to me, so -- nobody laughed at that? I guess that's just Korean humor."
for,We know she's here. We don't want to get in trouble.
against,"Yeah, you don't want to be in trouble with my m other here. So, there's a number -- a number of things to say, most of which I've forgotten because I was telling jokes . But the problem with this view of the Bill of Rights is, I quite agree the Bill of Rights is there to protect minority rights . I missed it in their presentation. I didn'thear any discussion of any minorities who are being singled out here for mistreatment by the government. This is a surveillance program that works on everybody . In fact, there is no way to know what the race or gender of the people whose data's being collected for . If there were cases -- if it was targeted -- say, for example, if the IRS was only considering the applications of conser vative groups or liberal groups for tax s tatus, that would be targeting a minority group, right? target some for their ideology . Then I think you would have a much better claim . This is not about --"
for,"Well, that would be relevant if we were making a claim under the equal protection cla use of the 14th Amendment, but instead we have a specific text in the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits these types of searches. So that's what's violated, not equal treatment under --"
against,"No, I disagree."
for,mom.
against,"I disagree because, you know, again, the text of the Fourth Amendment says that people have a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and so that's why you have to look at democracy . My claim is not that this means this is not to be done . It's that all of us in society have a view on what's reasonable and unreasonable . It's not a monopoly of five justices of th e Supreme Court to tell us as a society what is reasonable and unreasonable . And we have, as Stewart mentioned , in previous cases, looked to Congress and the president and the courts all together picked by us in elections to decide what's a reasonable search when telephones came along and the internet comes along. John Donvan:And on the point of reasonable versus unreasonable, Alex Abdo, I want to take it to you, something that, John, you said that's opening remarks. He made the argument that the program is not unreasonable -- see, I think basically his context was being in a -- you know, in a war situation that it's a security situation, that reasonable is weighed in the context of larger consequences . And his argument was, if it's saving liv es, if it's defeating the enemy, then it stops being so unreasonable because of the stakes involved."
for,"I think that's a narrow way of viewing the Constitution, but it's not particularly surprising that professor Yoo makes that argument. You know, professor Yoo made the same argument with respect to the fact that war time authority trumped individual protection against torture . And I think that's a wrong way of viewing the Constitution."
against,"I -- that's not correct, by the way . But go ahead."
for,"We can discuss that another time . But in any event, the question of whether --"
against,Let's discuss it now. I mean --
for,"I'll withdraw that . I apologize. Sure. So , I think the Constitution protects us from unreasonable searc hes and seizures. And the initial question that you need to ask is whether it is ever reasonable for the government to engage in bulk collection . And the problem with going down that route is we would end up in a society that the framers could not possibly have envisioned which is that the government would always, for good purpose, it would say, collect vast quantities of information about people who've done absolutely nothing wrong . But even if you think that's an acceptable way of thinking about the Co nstitution, the problem with our opponents' arguments is that two separate review groups, both with access to classified evidence, who 've now reviewed the case that they're relying on to suggest that this program is necessary, have conclude d that it simply isn't necessary. T hat the government could have accomplished its interest through the targeted use of surveillance orders to these companies or to other companies."
against,"So , the notion that you can somehow figure out -- well, there's something like mass data collection, and we'll just say, that can't be collected without implicating the Fourth Amendment is just as Alex said, superseded by the march of technology . There are a million subpoenas today for call data records for law enforcement purposes . That means tens of millions of records in the hands of government agencies on what amounts to a mass basis . There are ten million suspicious activities reports filed by financial institutions about their bank account holders because they want the government to know about what's happening . Is that mass collection? There are 4.5 million medical records reviewed by Medicare, your medical records and ours, reviewed by Medicare, looking for fraud every day . All of those things are things that serve important antifraud purposes that the United States government is pursuing . If we suddenly start to say, it's mass collection, it must be a Constitutional problem, we're going to have a line -drawing problem to beat every line -drawing problem we've ever seen."
for,"No, I don't think I would. Everyone to have reviewed the way that the NSA should go about its business says it should go about it in a targeted way . And that the key to protecting the country is not thr ough suspicionless surveillance of everyone, but through very targeted efforts directed at those who are doing us harm . I think that's the lesson of the two review groups who reviewed this program . That's the conclusion that the president himself has come to . I think that's what's also consistent with our Constitutional values. I think when you're talking about bulk collection, yes.John Donvan: Let me go to the other side, just see if they have a response to that. You've already, to some degree, answered that . But John Yoo, if you want to take it on."
against,"Yeah . I mean, I think that that shows how unreasonable the other side's position is that that no matter how much the security threat goes, they are unwilling to bend and allow certain kinds of searches. I think that choice is actually allowed to us under the Fourth Amendment by saying ""reasonable searches and seizures."" I was there on 9/11 . And we were confronted by an enemy that snuck i nto the country, communicated by email and phone calls . How did we even find them ? How did we even know they were all hijackers toget her? We looked at exactly this kind of data to piece it together . Of course, this is going to be the way we would need to catch such people in the future . Look at what our great terrorist enemies now -- I'm really worried, actually . I think the threat is much greater now than it was earlier because we have an enemy, ISIS, that controls a lot of territory, population, sophisticated weapons and is beheading Americans abroad, and we are doing very little about it . I think we need to have such kinds of prog rams in effect to stop them from getting over here."
for,"Yeah, I just wanted to s ay, you know, especially when you bring up a lot of these very frightening scenarios, I think it's important to remember that, as Alex pointed out earlier, these bipartisan commissions that have access to the classified data have not found that this bulk dat a collection has led to the prevention of an imminent attack . You know, I think I might take a slightly softer position than Alex on this in the sense that the Fourth Amendment doctrine does allow for exigent circumstances, exceptions to a warrant requ irement, and that's -- but that's very, very narrowly circumscribed."
against,"Let me just take this briefly . The last 10 years, this program has not produced an enormous number of successes . It is designed for an attack from a safe haven that is carefully planned . We've had 10 years in which we've wiped out the safe havens . We've put boots on the ground in Afghanistan to make sure that al- Qaeda could not plan attacks there . Only now is there a new safe haven where we can't put boots on the ground . We are in a different world . And the idea that this program might not have been particularly effective in a time when there was no safe hav en does not tell us what it will be like in the future. So , let me try that . You elitist New Yorker, you. Let me try this. Burner phones make it much easier for you to make one phone call and throw the phone away, buy another phone, make one phone call . It makes it much harder to find people, and it's certainly impossible to say, ""I have a wiretap order on this person,"" and to be able to get all of their calls . But what you can do, again, you can use the pattern of their calls to identify people as suspect. If you use a bu rner phone to call a safe house in Yemen, the government ought to be able to find out about that call and then to look at the pattern of calls -- Okay. John Donvan:-- yeah, but I wanted to let the other side take a crack at that question because you are being presented again and again with situations where the defense of the nation -- the cases increasingly amaze that the defen se of the nation would be enhanced it is argued by the ability to do these searches or seizures, and that, therefore, that affects the reasonableness issue . Do you -- let's hear from Alex on this one."
for,"Yeah, I think, again, one of the easiest responses is simply that this issue has been analyzed by two bipartisan groups of individuals who concluded that we can engage in targeted collection of information to solve these problems . You know, one of the repeated hypotheticals has come from Stewart about the Safe House in Yemen. And in that particular example, which was the pre -9/11 one that NSA supporters have used as the best example for why they need this program . Both -- or maybe it was just one of the commissions . But one of the commissions very carefully studied that particular example . And they decided that it would have been very easy for the government to have used targeted surveillance requests to uncover the link between the Safe House in Yemen and the parties on the U.S . end because they had the phone number of the Safe House . Indeed, they had to have the phone number because that's the only way they knew about the Safe House . And they could have taken that phone number and gone to the three major telecoms in the United States and served them with this order . And they would have very quickly uncovered the existence of the Safe House. That's what the commission concluded . And I think the same is likely true for burner phones."
against,"Do you think we so distrust ourselves that we need justices and Supreme Court Justices five to know what a burner phone is and then to figure out the right rule ? You know, I mean, the Justices of the Supreme C ourt, they probably think a burner phone is something that's too hot to touch for a little while . You got to let it cool down. They have no idea what burner phone -- J ohn Donvan: Well, like the moderator, they could just ask the question and find out the answer very quickly. John Yoo:Do we so distrust that we can't make that decision through legislation to figure out the best way to -- the worst thing would be if the judges set a rule down in concrete, and then set our response in a way that we can't take account of evolving technologies . I think it's much better for a legislature, Executive Branch to study the problem, figure out the best responses as we go along, as new technology develops."
for,"Yeah . You know, we have already made this decision . We the people ratify the Fourth Amendment . And so, I think that to make it seem like that's still in play just disregards the Constitution. But I, you know, I want to make a point about law enforcemen t. And, you know, the Fourth Amendment does not yield to concerns of efficiency . The Supreme Court very clearly stated this just at the end of its last term when it said that, “ If the police want to search a S martphone when it's arresting someone, that would be a great way to find really good evidence.” And, in fact, they did in those cases. They have, you know, pictures of this guy with guns in front of a car that used in a shooting . But the court said that privacy comes at a cost. And when that cost is efficiency, that must yield to the concerns of the Fourth Amendment. So, you know, these Justices understand technology . They have clerks. And they have said tha t digital is different when it comes to the Fourth Amendment, and that the Fourth Amendment doesn't just yield to make things easier for law enforcement in all circumstances."
against,"They could, but that's -- but they haven't done it yet. And now lower court has yet. Instead, in all -- there's lots of other contexts where the court has adopted this balancing approach . I was going to say, metal detectors at airports . Aren't those searches ? Drunk driver checkpoints, aren't those searches ? Urinalysis drug testing for employers . I mean, there's lots of contexts, actually, where our government has been allowed to conduct broad, non- particularized searches that are considered fairly minimal in order t o stop a great threat to public safety . If our justices don't --"
for,"I think it's wrong to say that our courts are not grappling the question of whether Smith V . Maryland remains relevant today . Not too long ago, a Court of Appeals said that our email is protected by the Constitution, even though we have to share it with Gmail . That's a very common -sense conclusion , but it's one that our opponents wouldapparently resolve by saying email is not protected because it' s stored on the servers of a third party . And more recently, the Supreme Court has said, five justices have said, in various opinions, that Smith vs . Maryland may not make sense in the digital era. And it's quite obvious why , because if that were the law of the land, then virtually everything we do today, which is reduced to a digital trail, would be susceptible to bulk collection by the government."
against,"I t hink we're stressing different sides of the ledger when the government -- When the court has taken these questions, what's reasonableness mean, they actually say, we weigh the interest of the government versus privacy interests of the individual . And then all I'm saying is I think we as a society should look at all of that and balance it ourselves . My personal, I think Stewart's personal, and I think the views of the Congress and the president and many judges has been, i n this context in war, the national security interests, which is the most important government interest there is it -- the courts have said that, and the framers said that many times -- just outweigh theintrusion of -- I'm not denying there's an intrusion of privacy. But the -- you know, outweigh the intrusion of privacy in collecting phone numbers -- phone numbers, not the calls . Email addressing, not the content of emails. Yes."
for,"I would just amend Professor Yoo's response on the legal question in just one way . The Supreme Court has said that ""reasonableness"" means -- is in general a balance, except when the government c an accomplish its interests in a targeted way . And in that context, the Supreme Court has always said that the government must proceed with a warrant based upon probable cause . If the government can accomplish its interests in that targeted way, it must. And that's not perhaps surprising . That's been our Constitutional tradition since -- since the late 1700s, and it should continue to do so today. Thank you so much, John . So I think it's important to think about what we haven't heard tonight . We haven't heard any solid case for why the government needs to engage in this mass collection of Americans' phone rec ords, going on every day. As Alex said, if you make a call tonight, the NSA will know about it and have it recorded tomorrow . They haven't shown that there is the need to engage in this dragnet surveillance that offends the principles of the Constitution, to thwart an imminent attack . And while we have talked a lot about some of these very disturbing scenarios of terrorist activity, I think that getting back to one of the questions earlier, it is in these times of crisis, it is in those times, as well as in the easy times, that our principles and our devotion to our founding principles are tested. And we the people have already determined that the question of whether or not the people shall be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures is not up for debate . It is something that is enforceable in our courts, and it's something that we the people have decided upon many, many years ago . And in closing, I just want to get to this very odd idea which we didn't explore any more, about somehow that it's okay that the government just collects the information and it's not really problematic for the Constitution if they don't actually look at it. Well, I want you to think about this before you vote again . You know, if the government stationed a p erson to stand next to your bathtub every time you took a bath, do you think your privacy isn't invaded if the government agent stands there with his hands over his eyes the whole time ? I'm going to think that you're going to think things have gotten a lo t less private up in there before he looks when you're taking your bath. So , I think we need to think about the collection of this information is just as bad as if they actually looked at the content and not just the fact that they take this information in the first place reveals a lot of data and personal information about u s in general. Thanks, John. I want to take a slightly different tack . So, in 1981, it cost around $300,000 to store a gigabyte of data . By 2010, just a couple years ago, that cost had plummeted to about 10 cents . And by next year, some people estimate it'll be about 2 cents to store a gigabyte of data . And just to give yo u a sense of what that means for surveillance, it means that you could store the entire audio from every single phone call that a single person has made over the course of an entire year for about 10 cents . And by next year, it'll be about 2 cents.19:51 :05 That result of that plummeting cost of storage is that for the first time in our nation's history, truly pervasive surveillance is possible . It'll be possible for the government to store not just -- not -- to keep track of not just who you email, who you call and what websites you visit . They'll be able to make a copy of every email you send, to record every phone call you make, to archive every website that you visit . And the cost has fallen so much and so dramatically that it will soon even be pos sible for the government to record virtually every step you take once you leave the house . This is not science fiction . This is a predictable result of falling storage and the proliferation of these types of surveillance devices on military fi elds now coming home to return to us to local law enforcement . I think that's why this debate, tonight's debate on mass collection of phone records, is about so much more than phone records and so much more than the NSA. If our opponents are correct, it won't end with the NSA . It won't end with the FBI, and it won't end with even local law enforcement. Mass collection will be the norm. So , the choice you have is whether you want to live in a free society or one in which our every movement and our every communication is tracked, recorded and stored in a database . In the past, cost was the main protection we had against that sort of world. But cost is no longer an issue . The Fourth Amendment is all we have left . And that's why I think you should vote for the motion that mass collection violates the Fourth Amendment."
against,"Well, it's been a great pleasure to participate in this debate and try to urge you one way or the other . And, you know, we're sitting in Philadelphia. Again, I'd like to emphasize, my hometown. John Yoo:And we're at the site of the drafting of the c onstitution in the little room across the way . And this is not a perfect document. It wasn't a document that bent to one overall principle or another. One thing you get very much a sense of if you go visit that little room or you read accounts of the Constitution that it was the product of compromises made by practical people who wanted to create a workable government. That's why we have with the Senate melded with popular representation in the House . And so our Constitution does two things . It does protect rights and the right to be from unreasonable searches and seizures . But as many justices, particularly Justice Jackson, remind us, the Constitution is also not a suicide pact. It is not a document that's designed to place individual rights above the ability of our society to defend itself from foreign attack . And so that's ho w we are supposed to look at these kinds of questions by the text of the Fourth Amendment and by decades and decades of Supreme Court opinions, going back many, many years . What is a reasonable thing for us as a society to do ? Is it reasonable to try to find al-Qaeda terrorists using these kinds of technologies or do we think that they so outweigh our rights to privacy that judges should stop them ? I would say actually that this is a decision where our side is arguing for a little bit of mode sty and humility, that we don't have the right answer . We cannot predict the way technology will run . We can't predict everything al -Qaeda's going to do, our enemy's going to do . We think that the best way to make this decision is to have an evolving st andard based on what legislatures and executive branch do, not to rely on a few judges . As I keep saying, what kind of society do we want to live in? I think that's for us to decide through elections, through our own choices and not because a few judges on the Supreme Court tell us what kind of society to live in. So thank you very much, and vote for us. I think they're for sale right outside."
