for, And I can see far ahead as well.,
for,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. The gravity of the issue we're debating here tonight cannot be overstated. At stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago. To keep our country secure, our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds. We cannot disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists. We cannot publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings. We have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax. But equally at stake is the character of our democracy. We live in an open society, and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea. Secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing. And we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name, including the things that it's doing in secret, or at least some of them. And indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets. And that's the way things are, and that's the way they ought to be. But even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets, it must do so under the rule of law. That is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy. Now here, as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we run head long into the First Amendment. The First Amendment says that Congress shall make nolaw abridging freedom of speech or the press. But, of course, we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press, all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts. We can't libel one another. We can't engage in false advertising. And of course, it's forbidden to yell, ""Fire"" -- falsely yell, ""Fire"" in a crowded theater like this one. Now, Congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets. The Espionage Act was mentioned but one might also point to the Atomic Energy Act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons. Or the COMINT Act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography, or code breaking, or the Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover CIA officers and other intelligence officers of the U.S. government. Now, these laws are all in obvious tension with the First Amendment, but no court has ever struck them down. And it is a statement of fact, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition under debate here tonight, the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, is inarguably true. Valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets. Now, does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here, David Sanger, publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison? Absolutely not. That would be foolish in the extreme. That's why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp. It marks lots of things secret that need not be. And back when I was an editor at Commentary Magazine, I myself published classified information and I would do so again. The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger. Such danger is not purely hypothetical. Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world. In 1975, it outed Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens. And no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation. Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet. Now, some of those documents are innocuous. And many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing, but some of them are outright dangerous. One WikiLeaks document, a U.S. Army document that they put on the Internet, describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs. Now, I ask you is there any reasonable person whobelieves it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield? Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax? Those are questions that I hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz. If they believe those things should be allowed, I hope they'll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they'll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose. Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets. Not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do. And if you in the audience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said, that the Constitution of the United States is not a suicide pact, I urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight. ",1.0
against,"All I can tell you is ""Reversal of Fortune,"" having been produced by son, Elon Dershowitz, who is in the audience, is a much better film. Thank you so much.  It's a distinct pleasure to be arguing with two such distinguished people -- Gabriel Schoenfeld, whose book I reviewed for The New York Times, and reviewed very favorably. And I admire much of what he writes, but we disagree, and you'll hear the disagreements. And Judge Michael Chertoff, whose work as a public figure deserves all of our appreciation. He has helped protect us for so many years. And of course, my distinguished colleague who will be arguing on my side. The proposition is far too broad. “State secrets” encompass far too much. And even the criteria used by my opponent -- quote “places the country in danger” -- is far, far too broad. Let me start with a story that one of my dissident clients told me in the 1970s, when I was representing Soviet dissidents in the bad old days of the Soviet Union. The joke went around during Stalin's time that a dissident was arrested for the crime of calling Stalin a “fool.” And he came to court and he said, “I didn't commit a libel. I want to defend myself. I will prove that what I said is truthful.” And he said, “You don't understand. You're not being charged with libel. You're being charged with revealing a state secret!” And that's precisely the kind of state secret that we often seek to protect. Now, you don't have to be Stalin. Remember, everybody knows -- every newspaperman memorizes the famous quote of Thomas Jefferson that he made before he became a president. He said, “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” That was pre-presidential Thomas Jefferson. Now let me read you a quote six years into his presidency: “A man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them. And as much as he who knows nothing is nearer the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.” Thomas Jefferson sought to censor the press. We all know that he opposed the Alien and Sedition Act. Of course he did, because that was federal legislation. But he supported state legislation that would have censored the press and protected him from embarrassment. Now, you just have to look in today's New York Times to see how foolish some of these state secrets that are protected tend to be. Finally, finally, the Pentagon papers are about to be declassified and released. I defended Senator Mike Gravel against the charges of reading the Pentagon papers -- what was it -- 40 years ago! And Daniel Ellsberg, in today's Times, I think aptly states the reason why the Pentagonpapers were censored for so long. He said, “The reasons are very clearly domestic political reasons, not national security at all. The reasons for the prolonged secrets are to conceal the fact that so much of the policy making doesn't bear public examination. It's embarrassing or even incriminating.” You don't have to be as cynical as Ellsberg -- and Ellsberg is not one of my heroes. I agree with Gabriel Schoenberg's analysis of Ellsberg for the man. But the point is a very, very important one. Secrets get disclosed all the time. And the issue is not whether secrets will be disclosed. If you read The New York Times, if you read Bob Woodward, if you read Seymour Hersh, you understand the question is who decides which secrets are disclosed to whom?  Secrets get disclosed. Bob Woodward has its sources. Why do people talk to Bob Woodward? Why do they give him classified information? Why do they give Seymour Hersh classified information? Because those are secrets that government officials want to have revealed. So the question is not “Should state secrets be subject to the First Amendment?” The question is, “Should the government -- the executive branch of the government -- be making the decision as to which secrets to withhold and which to reveal?” Secrets should be kept. And the primary responsibility for keeping secrets lies with those who have those secrets. If you look, for example, at how WikiLeaks got disclosed, the alleged culprit there is man -- a private named Bradley Manning -- who have never should have had access -- such easy access to the material that he disclosed. That was negligence on the part of the government. As Julian Assange, I think, aptly put it, “The best way to keep a secret is not to know it.” And if the government wants to keep secrets, they have to do a better job of preventing them from being leaked -- and not put the burden on the press. And by the way, I mean not only leaked WikiLeaks style, but leaked Bob Woodward, Seymour Hersh style, the kind of selective leaks that we've come to grow accustomed to. There are very limited numbers of secrets that deserve to be protected. And they can be listed and catalogued. You listed some of them. I agree with some. I disagree with others. The names of troops, of the nature of weapons. But you mentioned a couple, for example, methods used to track terrorists, vulnerability of bridges. Those are very complicated. We have a right to know, at least in broad terms, what kinds of methods are being used, whether they're constitutional or not. We have a right to know if our bridges are vulnerable, not how they're vulnerable. These are very, very hard judgments. So you can agree with our side of the proposition while conceding that there are a limited number of things that should be kept secret. And I believe -- and here we have a real disagreement. You wrote in your book that you would prefer to leave this to the good judgment of prosecutors, the discretion of prosecutors and the common sense ofjurors. What I would prefer to see is a complete starting from scratch with the Espionage Law of 1917.  It tells us nothing. And draft a very narrow statute that says you cannot disclose the nature of certain kinds of weapons. You cannot disclose the movement of troops. You cannot disclose the names of spies. That is not state secrets, broad general concept. That's a limited number of things that need protection, not protection from The New York Times because the Times won't publish them, but protection from Internet people who will publish almost anything without any kind of accountability. There must be a strong presumption in favor of freedom of speech and sunshine as the best disinfectant. The government says, ""Trust us.""  Don't trust the government. The New York Times says, ""Trust us."" Don't trust The New York Times. Trust the process of checks and balances, whereby the government tries to keep secrets. The press tries to release the secrets. That process is the best guarantee of liberty. ",1.0
for,"You're not going to hear any secrets from me, John.  First, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate. I think it's a critical issue for the country. I'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors. I think, though, if I'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets. Now, nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis. But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision. Is it the government and the government process, which is what our contention is and our proposition is, or is it the press. Does the press get the final say? Now, I will agree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets. And most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so. Although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access to those secrets. And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed. But the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets. And sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives. Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement. And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the United States. And in those instances, it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely. National security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat and mouse game. And so I would argue that actually the existing system, which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance. How does that work? Well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it's very difficult to do so. And there's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material. But we do have cases where the material gets out. And there, I believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret. And that's in fact what the law basically is. There are statutes in the books that permit those prosecutions. When the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions, and those are relatively rare cases, the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions. Even in the Pentagon papers case, at least five of the justices and probably seven,indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if not in that particular case. And even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material. And that's because the courts recognize that in the government process, a combination of executive action, congressional action and judicial action is the best mechanism for balancing between state secrets and freedom of the press. Now, the press often argues we ought to be the judges. And the difficulty is that the press is sometimes a flawed judge of what is in the public interest. First of all, the press is not a monolith. As Professor Dershowitz pointed out, we're not concerned about The New York Times. We're worried about people who blog. But the First Amendment doesn't distinguish between The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and al Manar, which is the news organ of Hezbollah. Or extreme blogs on the right or the left. All of those are part of the press. Nor do we want to have the government start to license particular organs as organs that can be trusted and organs that can't be trusted. The fact is if we say that state secrets have to give way to the press when the press gets hold of them, then we mean it has to be any member of the press, a blogger, a Hezbollah journalist, somebody who works for a news organ run by the government of a foreign country. And I don't think any of us believe that would be prudent or safe. Is the press right even when we deal with the venerable institutions that we're so familiar with? Well, the press sometimes also makes mistakes. Several years ago, there was a publication by The New York Times. I know David Sanger knows about this, of information about a program that allowed the United States government to see what was going on in the financial transactions that were being executed through a program known as Swift. And this was critical in tracking the flow of money that was used to support terrorist activity. Precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the Bush administration, that material was published. And the original argument was, well, this is something people need to know about because it's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight. But what emerged after a period of time is it was completely legal and that there was nothing wrong about it, and nobody's privacy had been improperly invaded. Everything was done according to an appropriate process. And therefore, the public ombudsman of The New York Times had to write a retraction. He had to write a piece in the Times saying that while he had originally endorsed the publication of the Swift material, he had changed his mind, and itwas not appropriate because it turned out that there was nothing wrong with it, and there was no powerful interest served in releasing that material. And then he made an interesting and telling confession, that he had originally endorsed the disclosure because he didn't like the administration and the way the administration was treating the paper. And I suggest to you that that's the problem with having the press make the decision. The press is no more in a position to separate itself from its interests than anybody else. But unlike the organs of government which are accountable to the public and to each other, the press is accountable to nobody. And that's why I strongly urge you to support the proposition that we're advocating tonight. ",1.0
against,"A few.  And it's wonderful to be here and to be with such a great panel. In Schoenfeld's book, if you haven't read it, it's a wonderful accounting -- historical accounting of the tension between the press and the government. Michael Chertoff has done a fabulous work and we have talked over many years on many different subjects, and I agree with almost everything that my partner here had to say except when Alan Dershowitz declared that you shouldn't necessarily trust everything that you read in The New York Times. We’ll take that aside later on. I come to this as a practitioner, not as a legal expert. And I come to this knowing that the tensions that we are discussing here today are as you've heard as old as the Republic. The New York Times among other newspapers had reporters embedded with Civil War troops, Union troops, and at one appropriate moment or another, several generals having read the reviews of their strategy, took those reporters and put them in the brig. I've been around more than a few government officials who have suggested to me over the years as we have debated various stories that we were getting ready to write that what was good for General Sheridan would be perfectly good today. I would argue that in fact it is impossible, it is impossible to separate out state secrets from what appears every day in The New York Times and other major newspapers around the world. It is impossible because you cannot discuss the subject of whether or not we should have gone into Iraq, or how quickly we should get out of Afghanistan, or the issues surrounding cyber war that we deal with each and every day now, without daily venturing into territory that is classified somewhere and somehow. The problem is, as a reporter, I probably don't even know when much of that material is classified. And I can tell you as someone who went through the WikiLeaks material for many months before The Times and other newspapers published them that I was pretty surprised by some things that were stamped “secret.” I came into the office one day and asked if anybody knew why every American embassy that collects the morning news accounts that would appear in the Spanish press or the Chinese press and collates them and sends them off to Washington so that they would have a sense of what's appearing in those press reports each day. Somebody on the way out the door, as they are putting that cable over to Washington, stamps “secret” on them. They had appeared in the newspaper that morning. What does that tell you early on? It tells you that you cannot have a system in which you keep state secrets from being published if almost everything is a state secret. And my friend, Michael Chertoff, points out that the press is a flawed judge of the national interest. That is absolutely true, but a better judge than the U.S. government because when you read the U.S. government's own regulations for what gets made classified, what that stamp goes on, the rules only discuss national security considerations. There is no category that makes the person who's got that stamp in the hand weigh a public interest. Only the press can do that and only after the information is out. Now, there's a second issue around this which the other side pointed out, which is that only the executive, they said, really has the full knowledge to make those decisions. But in fact I think what you heard in the discussion of the constitutional origins of all of this is that the foundersbelieved that to give the executive complete discretion in this area is to create a country that isn't like the America that we know. You would get Egypt under Mubarak; you would get the Chinese press today. And Americans feel that deeply. Just think about the criticism directed at The New York Times when we failed to go as deeply as we should have into the evidence concerning the justification for going into Iraq. It would have been wonderful if we could have published more about what the U.S. government knew about whether weapons of mass destruction existed. Eventually, we were able to. But at the time we were doing that reporting, it was all deeply classified, except for those tidbits that the U.S. government decided to release to support its own case. Now, we are hardly indifferent, as reporters, to the question of what the consequences of these actions are. We live in New York and Washington. Our kids ride the subways. We have reporters who are out all across the world. Many have been kidnapped. A couple, unfortunately, have been killed. A wonderful photographer for The New York Times lost both his legs just a few months ago, stepping on an improvised land mine in Afghanistan. We know that the violent jihadists, who we write about each and every day, have no interest in a free press. And we're not here to side with them. We are also not here to be propagandists for the U.S. government. And you don't want us to be. If you think, briefly, about some of the stories that we have held back on, we held back for a year on the story on warrantless wiretaps that President Bush authorized. Eventually, we published it. Congress decided to rewrite the law. We held back for three years -- on a story I worked on for some time -- about a secret U.S. government program to help secure Pakistan's nuclear weapons. We held the story because the government was fearful that if we published it too soon, we would be giving al-Qaeda or the Taliban directions into how to get to those weapons. And we published stories that are quite controversial including one earlier this year about Stuxnet, the computer virus that many believe the U.S. government had a role in developing. It was used against the Iranian nuclear program. What possibly could be the interest in that? Very simple. If the U.S. government -- if any other government -- is starting off a cyber war, well, we are the country that is most vulnerable to that problem. And we could be subject to attacks in response. So, these are central policy issues. These secrets are not merely published because they are cool stories. They are published because there is a debate that the public has to conduct. ",1.0
for,"First of all, I respect David, and I certainly don't want to suggest he should ever put himself in harm’s way. But I think the answer to that is yes. Most of the issues which David has talked about can be written about without getting into matters that are state secrets. First of all, there are times that information is declassified or becomes available from other sources and doesn't need to be entered into in great detail. But to give you an example of something that I would argue you shouldn't be able to do, is in the run-up to the bin Laden raid that resulted in eliminating bin Laden, obviously, it was a compelling public story. And the fact that we were going to be invading another sovereign country and taking military and fatal action against an individual who had not been tried or convicted was a big issue. I think it was a good idea, but others might have disagreed. And yet had that been leaked in advance, had it gotten into the hands of the press, I would argued it would be quite appropriate for the government to say to David Sanger, “If you publish that, we will prosecute you, and perhaps we will even enjoin you from publishing it.” Absolutely.",2.0
against,"Well, certainly the bin Laden raid raises a very good question and is one in which The New York Times has been very clear throughout the time that we went through the WikiLeaks material. Long before that, we have said, as you can see from the examples I cited earlier, that we do not publish stories about operations. We don't name dissidents who walked into the Chinese embassy and talked to American diplomats. Where do we draw the line? Information that is merely embarrassing as opposed to operational. So the U.S. government, during the midst of the WikiLeaks operation, asked us to withhold the information that the king of Saudi Arabia said in response to a discussion with an American diplomat about Iran's nuclear program, ""Cut off the head of the snake."" Now, why did they consider this to be particularly sensitive? No one was going to go put theking of Saudi Arabia in jail the way a Chinese or Saudi dissident might be put in jail for saying the wrong thing. They considered it sensitive because it would make it more difficult to conduct American foreign policy if the king read his own words in The New York Times or foreign publications. And so that's the distinction that I think is critical, the one between an operational secret and embarrassment. And there is no place in the law that makes that distinction.",2.0
for,"Well, I find that curious. Operational secrets -- what is the Swift program? But an operational program to monitor the finances of al-Qaeda that the Times published against the strong protest not only of the Bush administration but leading Democrats like Lee Hamilton of the 9/11 Commission. And the Times justification for it was always quite murky. Eric Lichtblau, the reporter, one of the two reporters who wrote the story, said in his memoir about it, ""It was, above all else, an interesting yarn."" What was the public interest that was served there? The Times -- the ombudsman of the Times, as Secretary Chertoff pointed out, disavowed the story. So did the general counsel of the Times. So I don't think that in the final analysis we can just have a system where editors make the -- make such decisions without being subject, vulnerable to prosecution, not necessarily prosecuted, for instance, but vulnerable to prosecution.",2.0
against,"Well, I can tell you that the greatest forms of censorship that take place today are not censorship imposed by the government. It's self-censorship resulting from fear of prosecution. I see that all the time, or fear of libel, other kinds of defamation lawsuits. So clearly it has an impact. But I'm not one who thinks that free speech is free or that it comes without costs. In fact, I think we've heard a very clever debaters' point here tonight from our opponents, namely that if we concede that there are any conceivable state secrets like the plan to kill Osama bin Laden, then we can see the proposition. That's absolutely not the case. The proposition is state secrets. And I submit that you've conceded our point by changing the debate from state secrets to -- and I quote Judge Chertoff -- to ""Genuine state secrets."" And you also used a modifier, ""Real state secrets."" The problem is it's just too broad. Now, there are going to be problems. And The New York Times is not the only game in town. Judge, you mentioned, how about the Hezbollah press? They might publish it. Do you think American law is going to stop the Hezbollah press from publishing anything? So that's just a red herring.",2.0
for,"But, see, I think this is the point. The point is -- and I don't think we have to argue that simply calling something a state secret ends the analysis. What's important is whether it's in The New York Times or Hezbollah press or somebody else. If they are in an area where they are dealing with material that is classified and sensitive, they have to make a judgment. Now, there's a certain amount of uncertainty. And I understand that may have a chilling effect. But that chilling effect is what imposes a sense of responsibility. And let me say, everybody in the world who exercises power and authority, lives with the possibility that if they guess wrong, they're going to wind up in trouble, including, for example, CIA agents who find themselves being investigated, and yet nobody says they should be immune from the possibility of investigation.",2.0
against,"I just think you're wrong empirically. I think you're wrong empirically. It's not the fact that people are guessing wrong.  He knows he's not being prosecuted because he's revealing a secret that you -- not you personally -- but somebody in the administration gave him on the sly. They say that, ""We know it's classified, but please print this because it makes us look good. And if you print it, you won't be prosecuted."" The end result is that people only feel chilled when they release secrets that make the administration look bad. When they reveal secrets that make the administration look good, they are not going to be prosecuted. I'll give you an example. I'm a supporter of the Obama administration. I think they handled the post-Osama bin Laden killing miserably. What did they do? They revealed the fact that they got computers. That was a victory lap. Nobody should have ever known that they got computers. They revealed the fact that they got telephone numbers of two guys in Osama bin Laden's phone book. Nobody should have revealedthat. Why did the Obama administration reveal that? They were proud of it. But they didn’t reveal the pictures. Why didn’t they reveal the pictures?-- Can I do the job?  Can I do the job the way all of you want me to do the job? Probably not. And that's because, as you said, there is uncertainty in the system. There's always going to be uncertainty in this system. But the uncertainty can't extend to the point where we are stopping from publishing something that may be published, as Alan points out, outside the country. It may be available in another form, maybe at a U.N. agency, maybe among international nuclear inspectors, and also was classified in the United States. And we simply will not know. We cannot know what is classified. You have to assume that almost anything on a sensitive subject like this is classified in some way. And so we have to roll that dice every single day. And we're willing to take that risk not for us, but because there is a broader readership and citizenship out there -- That's not true. That's not true.",2.0
for,"I think that illustrates my point, which is, in fact, the proposition is correct. Freedom of the press does give way before state secrets. And the reason that we can accept that proposition is because we have built a structure that actually is quite protective even within the terms of that proposition. The reason that there haven't been prosecutions of journalists is because people weigh what will happen in a courtroom with a judge and a jury. And so when you do your job in a close case, if you feel you're acting in good faith, you can have a reasonably high degree of confidence that if it doesn't wind up in a prosecution, you can go to court, and you're going to wind up prevailing in front of a judge and a jury.",2.0
against,"And that's the worst possible result because what it says -- -- is if The New York Times, if you're Seymour Hersh, if you're Bob Woodward, you have nothing to worry about. But if you're Julian Assange, and you're not working under the supervision of the government, if you're not somebody who has a constant relationship with the government, you have plenty to worry about. It gives the government far too much discretion to go after people who reveal information that is not something they want revealed. And I think, frankly, you're asking the wrong question. Can he do the job? That's a terrible criteria under the First Amendment. We can change it and say, could we have literature without there being sex? Of course we can. We can have Shakespeare. But that's never been the criteria under the First Amendment. Can you do your job? That shifts the presumption and the burden to the press to justify that it can do its job. The answer is, is there a constraint, a lawful and -- constraint on the way the press does its job, and I think the answer to that is there's far too much discretion inthe government to decide who to go after for leaking and who not to, and that's very dangerous.",2.0
for,"And actually I think Alan -- It may be dangerous for leakers but it certainly -- the historical record is not one of danger for the press. There's never been a successful prosecution of journalists as David Sanger just noted. And the one case, I'm wondering what you think about it, that where there was -- a prosecution was initiated, The Chicago Tribune case in World War II where the government -- where The Chicago Tribune published a front page story strongly suggesting that we had broken the Japanese naval codes, a leak that could have cost the lives of tens of thousands of U.S. servicemen. Now, there are plenty of people, journalists who think that there shouldn't -- that there shouldn't have been a prosecution, but, I mean, that seems to me almost madness.",2.0
against,"Well, first of all there have been many, many prosecutions not under that particular statute but you've heard about shouting ""fire"" in the crowded theater. Do you know what the facts were of that case? There was a guy who was handing out leaflets in front of a draft board, telling people to consider whether or not they might have a constitutional right to be a conscientious objector. And Oliver Wendell Holmes, in the worst analogy ever constructed by the legal mind -- -- turned that into shouting fire in a crowded theater. The analogy was handing out a leaflet outside of a burning theater, saying, “Please don't go in there, it might be unsafe to you,” and he turns out to be wrong. Well, you know -- Let’s take Gabe’s question right on because these are decisions we have to make every day. During the run up to the Iraq War, the Bush administration said repeatedly that they had made no decision and had no plans to invade Iraq. The New York Times discovered over the July 4th holiday in 2002 that there was a very detailed plan to invade Iraq. And it published that fact with just enough detail to make it clear that in fact the Bush administration had put together a plan, but not quite enough detail to actually tell Saddam Hussein what that plan looked like. Now, there were many in the Bush administration at that time who were calling for the prosecution of The New York Times. I think The New York Times served an enormously important public interest there by making it clear to the public that no matter what government officials were saying in public to them, in fact they had a plan based on what we now know was fairly loose evidence, to invade a foreign country.",2.0

The flipside of it is to go back to the bin Laden case and maybe The Times wouldn't have published it, but there might be other news organs that would, if a news organ had gotten a hold of the plan to put SEALs into Abbottabad and they had been able to consider publishing that without any fear of being prosecuted or being enjoined, with absolute impunity, would that be where we want to see the United States? I suggest if you go back to the very quote that Gabriel made earlier about the Constitution not being a suicide pact, giving that absolute protection would be devastating for the United States. I think there's an answer to that. If a newspaper learned about the fact that the SEALs were preparing to attack bin Laden, then that attack should have been aborted. You haven't been keeping your secrets well enough. You can't depend on a newspaper's discretion to put the lives of brave American SEALs at risk. So if you find out that a newspaper has that report, you have to abort. Sometimes -- Well, let me give you a story.

There are other times when you're reviewing other kinds of information that would be terribly devastating or damaging, again, recipes for certain kinds of weapons or for the revelation of certain kinds of operational plans.

I think it was legal. I think it was legitimate. I think we did a good job. I think we did a terrible job right after it in what information we revealed and what information we withheld. My only point was, if the United States government can't keep a secret like that, and if The New York Times learns about it, or Hezbollah learns about it, the press learns about it -- we have to really, seriously think about whether this is an operation you want to have go forward. What worries me most is the attitude I've heard from some of the questions -- the government knows more than we know. We, the government, know better. You hear that from every tyrannical regime in the world. The government knows better. We live in a system where the government has to be checked by the press, where the press is checked by the government, where we have confusion, uncertainty, we have no ability to really know in advance how it will come out. We don't know whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing. In retrospect, it was a good thing that bin Laden was killed and that the press didn't reveal it. It might have come out differently.  What we need are rules. And the rules that we have now -- Sure. And my answer to that would be, in many cases, it makes the world significantly safer, because the government is feeling some pressure, the U.S. government, to take a system that they may not have focused on entirely well and actually make it better. Let me give you an example that comes right from Mr. Chertoff's time when he was at Homeland Security. President Bush would frequently laud the fact that imports into the United States go through nuclear detectors that were put at every port. And everyone knew, including many of the importers, that these nuclear detectors did not deal well with anything that was shielded. In other words, you could put through a lot of different material through the port of Los Angeles, and these detectors were frequently set off by kitchen tables, by Chinese toilets. Nuclear weapons, that was another issue. Now, at some point, many newspapers got around to writing about that. Did we put the United States at greater danger?

For example, if you want to talk about general vulnerability in the New York subway system, you can argue that that's not harmful. It's even helpful. If you want to say there's a particular location where a bomb would cause a crippling devastating blow to the operation of the system, that, I think, would make us unsafe, and that should be a state secret.

In our whole history we've never had a successful prosecution of a journalist, and only one attempted prosecution.

This has been a really interesting discussion that I think has revealed in our discussion of the ambiguity of the current law why a statement as broad as freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets can't stand simply because we cannot really define terribly well what is a true state secret worth protecting. In 29 years as a reporter, I've learned that on two things we almost always get it wrong. Whenever something has been leaked to me and I read stories later on about who the leaker was, it's almost invariably wrong, which tells you people get themotivations wrong. But the second thing is my own estimate about what the effects are of publishing a given story is also almost always wrong. It's very difficult as you go in and write something to know whether or not it is actually going to have a very deleterious effect. And that's why we have ended up focusing on the narrowest questions, the obvious, the easy ones, the names of CIA agents, operations that are about to be conducted. Those are the easy questions. The hard question is what do you do to make sure that the press in the United States can force the government to debate policy on the most important questions, whether or not we invade a country and have the right evidence to go do so, whether or not we use a new weapon, whether it is a nuclear weapon in 1945 or a cyber weapon in 2011, and think out ahead what the effects could be once we legitimize that form of war. You cannot do that unless you have a bias in favor of publication, not just a bias among all of us, but a legal bias in favor of publication, one that will make sure that the republic holds together because we have made ourselves different by pressing for publication whenever there is doubt.",3.0

But I'm just reminded of an episode that occurred in late 2009, when a New York Times reporter -- one of your colleagues, David Rohde, was kidnapped by the Taliban. And Bill Keller, the executive editor of the paper, made the executive decision to withhold that information from the public. And not only did The Times not cover it, but he got all of his industry competitors and all of the Internet to agree not to reveal that David Rohde had been kidnapped. And the idea was he didn't want to do anything that would endanger Rohde's life. And of course, that was a speculative decision, because really, publishing information about Rohde -- the fact that he had been captured -- the Taliban knew he'd been captured. But they withheld the story. And I say to Bill Keller, “All honor to Bill Keller for that!” They protected the life of their guy. But when the decision involves non-journalists, it can't be. When it involves us. The people who ride the subway in New York. It can't be a voluntary decision up to Bill Keller. We -- and that's why we have laws on the books that in the final analysis, do allow for the prosecution of the journalists when they publish not just the random things that are stamped “secret” for no good reason, but the genuine, really hardcore secrets that place our lives in danger, including some of the things that your newspaper has published -- like the SWIFT story, once again.",3.0

That's where the other side has to add “genuine,” or “real,” or “some.” And I urge you to vote against this proposition, because if this proposition is passed, it sends an extremely dangerous message to the government -- that it continue business as usual. And the current situation is very clear. Anything that's published relating to national security today could be subject to prosecution. Whyaren't they prosecuted? Because the government -- the very government whose secrets are leaked -- makes the discretionary decision not to prosecute. That is the wrong body to trust to make the decision, whether to prosecute. What we need is specific, focused, legislatively enacted rules that say that no one -- not a favorable press, not an unfavorable press -- can ever, under any circumstances, reveal fact A, fact B, fact C.

The point is you don't trust juries and prosecutors with broad, overarching criminal statutes when it comes to the First Amendment. You narrow, you limit, and then you give it to the jury. But the last institution that should be making the decision who to prosecute is the very institution that is criticized by these revelations. So I urge you -- I urge you -- do not support this proposition. This proposition is dangerous to your liberty. ",3.0
for,"Well, we support the proposition because the proof of the pudding is that we've had hundreds of years of American history where these statues have not been, in fact, a tool to oppress or to run rampant through the First Amendment. I think that our adversaries have essentially conceded that there are a category of state secrets that ought to be protected. And what they are arguing is the existing structure is somehow not definite enough. But I just want to spend one minute talking about what the existing law is. Because in fact, I think it strikes the right balance, which is the context in which we advocate this proposition. We have the Communications Intelligence Act protecting the information about our top secret code breaking and code making communications activity, quite specific, very reasonable and very understandable. That's what keeps us safe. We have the Intelligence Identities Act, keeping the names of intelligence agents safe as David acknowledges is appropriate and again part of the law. Even the Espionage Act, which has gotten the brunt of the fire power here, requires a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent to damage the nationalsecurity of the United States, not good intentions, not accident, not negligence, but bad intent to injure the security of the United States. I would argue that's exactly the kind of specificity that is appropriate in defining the category of state secrets that we are arguing ought to be protected under this proposition. And in fact the message that will be sent will not be one that will chill responsible reporters. It will be one that will chill the Julian Assanges who want to publish things because they want to hurt the United States and then want to claim the First Amendment to protect them against the consequences of that kind of decision.
