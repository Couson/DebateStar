for,"Thank you. In this debate, I'm going to expound the case for the motion, in favor of central banks being able to print prosperity . And then my colleague, Simon Johnson, is going to hone in on the two keywords in this motion. That's to say: can and prosperity . This is a debate about the merits of central banks printing money to escape from or prevent a monetary collapse . In the jargon, the name given to the policy is quantitative easing, or QE for short . Under this policy, to b e clear, the central bank buys financial assets in the markets -- usually bonds -- with money that it itself creates, thereby increasing both its assets and its liabilities . In practice, usually, hardly any extra notes are actually printed . Rather, the money is created electronically . The extra money corresponds to extra deposits at the Central Bank . But since such deposits are freely interchangeable with notes, it's a -- I think, a fair approximation to discuss and describe this policy as p rinting money. And that's the convention I'm going to accept . This policy sounds extraordinary, even exotic, hence the apparent whiff of danger, doubtless soon to be puffed up – -- by the team sitting opposite . But in fact, this policy has featured in the standard economic textbooks for generations . Some of you may have read those textbooks -- looking around the room, some of you may even have written them -- under the name “open market operations.” Moreover, this policy has b een advocated by many great economists, includi ng the great Milton Friedman, the arch proponent of monetarism. Mind you, let's be clear about this . Printing money is not the answer to a maiden's prayer . There are limits to what it can achieve . And it's not for all seasons . It will not improve y our sex life or fix your gammy leg. M ore prosaically, it won't even raise the long -term sustainable rate of economic growth. We know the factors that are responsible for that determinant. That's to say, the real factors; hard work, investment , technological progress and organizational efficiency . But these all -important real factors operate through a financial and monetary system. And every so often that financial and monetary system breaks down -- sometimes in spectacular fashion . And when that happens, all these wonderful real things like hard work and technological progress and capital investment -- all that stuff, there is nothing . They're swept away from the tsunami of monetary collapse . There are three examples of monetary collapse in recent history : the 1930s, pretty much everywhere throughout the industrial world, Japan from the early 1990s on wards, and the financial crisis of 2008/9 . Let's concentrate, first of all, on the 1930s . In the Great Depression in the U.S. in the 1930s, let's recall -- some of us remember -- U.S . output fell by 30 percent. Unemployment rose to 25 percent of the work force . And, interestingly, the money supply contracted by 25 percent. This monetary contraction played a huge role in creating and sustaining the Great Depression . At the time, the Federal Reserve did little to stop the process . Indeed, it probably exacerbated it . By contrast, after the events of 2008/9, the deflati onary process was halted by QE here and in the Eurozone and in the UK and in Japan . Halted by central banks printing money . Now, although we refer to the years after 2008/9 as the G reat R ecession, the fall in output during that period, that downturn, was only about 4 percent . What could have been a rerun of the Great Depression, or even worse, was stopped in its tracks . Now, of course, the critics will say that this is all very well, but the policy will end in failure because inflation will pick up d ramatically. In fact, there's no need for inflation to pick up dramatically . QE can be set into reverse. The central bank can impose reserve requirements, and indeed it can also raise interest rates. The oft quoted example of Zimbabwe, which is -- which has suffered from hyperinflation, is simply not apposite at all. This is not a case of QE gone wrong. Rather, it's a result of gross government incompetence in bringing taxes to balance with expenditure . The U.S . isn't and can never become Zimbabwe . Other critics point to distortions in the economy created by the policy of QE . But to some extent, this is fair . There are some distortions created . But where are the distortions sufficient tooutweigh the creation of 13 million U.S. jobs si nce the downturn? The greatest distortion is in fact in the critic's sense of balance and perspective . Other critics argue they accept the idea that QE has saved the economy from something like the Great Depression. But interestingly, agains t the other bunch of critics, they say it would have been better if we had had a repeat of the Great Depression. Collapse is good! It would have purged the system . And what would have emerged at the end of all this would have been something stronger . Well, all I can say is that this purging of the system didn't exactly bring great benefits in the 1930s either in this country or indeed in Germany . The conclusion is clear. When the need arises, not only can central banks print prosperity, but they must. It is their bounden duty."
against,"Thank you. I wish I had a British accent, I think it would sound better. Good evening . I feel very privileged to be here tonight with these distinguished colleagues . I feel very privileged to be discussing a central bank like the Fed . In the case of the Fed, I have a great respect for the institution. These are smart, well -intentioned people . I know this because I worked with them for over 10 years . Indeed, as I hinted to you before, if you want to see what a central bank money printer looks like, you're looking at one right now, although just to level some expectations, most of them have a lot more hair than I do . My main argument tonight is a practice of a the ory won. I, too, once believed that central banks could print prosperity, and I was assigned with the task of actually spending the Fed's money . Now, even in this debate, you will see that my partner and I come at this topic from somewhat different perspectives . But where I know that Ed and I both strongly agree is that central bank money printing, activ ist monetary policy, is an unproductive tool when it comes to creating prosperity . What I'd add from my own perspective is that I believe that if it works at all, activist monetary policy has become counterproductive . It's potentially impairing future prosperity . Let's be honest about something to begin with. You guys all deserve a gold star for being here . Monetary policy is a very arcane subject . Discussing it in class in Rutgers is the closest thing I've found thus far to prescribing Am bien to my students. A lso, there's quite a bit of history . You can talk about the Burns Fed, you can talk about the Greenspan Fed. But I submit to you that what we're debating today is what the Fed and other central banks around the world began to do as of late 2008. Let me briefly take you back there . In the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S . economy was contracting by 2 percent in just three months alone . 2 million Americans were losing their jobs . Enter the Fed . Before and around the collapse of Lehman Brothers two months earlier, it had already extended more than $1.5 trillion in emergency loans, which along with Congress' TARP, stabilized Wall Street . Now on Black Friday, 2008, on the day after Thanksgiving, the Fed launched somethi ng known as quantitative easing, the largest economi c stimulus program in world history . The Fed was attempting a new experimental approach to try to help the larger economy, not just Wall Street . What is QE? Well, we've ta lked about it a little bit already . QE is basically a central bank like the Fed printing electronic money, known as reserves, and using those reserves to buy bonds, existing credit from Wall Street banks . The goal, essentially at the beginning, the Fed w as pumping cash into banks with the intention of stimulating a new wave of Wall Street credit creation in America. By both artificially making credit cheaper while freeing up lending capacity within the banks, the Fed was hoping to get more credit into the hands of citizens and businesses struggling from the economic downturn. In fact, before quantitative easing, Chairman Bernanke first called the initiative ""credit easing."" That's where I came into the picture . I was asked by the Fed to run a task with executing QE therapy's program, that $1.25 trillion initiative . And that's where, quite frankly, I started losing a lot more hair. My perspective today is shaped by what I saw inside the Fed. And what I saw inside the Fed is that in practic e we were basically pushing on a string with our money printing . What does that mean? In the end, from 2008 until 2014, when QE ended in America, the Fed printed and spent almost $4 trillion . What happened with that cash ? Well, two out of every three d ollars has ended up sitting idle in Wall Street banks . Today, specifically, $2.6 trillion of the Fed's cash sits in the big Wall Street banks, being banked like them at the Fed for interest like you and I might have a savings account . What happened to th e other one-third of the cash ? My own program is instructive . With our bond buying, we were specifically trying to stimulate U.S. mortgage lending by Wall Street banks . More home loans and more refis. But from the first day of the bond buying to the l ast, while we were pumping $1.25 trillion in reserves into the banks, the banks consistently cut their mortgage lending . By the end of the program, U.S. mortgage lending was down by 33 percent. And yet at the same time, what we saw on the desk was that instead of lending, Wall Street banks began to use whatever cash they did deploy speculatively, investing it . J.P. Morgan, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, you name it . They were using the cash mainly to pile into stocks, bonds, and commodities . This wasn't illegal. It was simply unproductive . It was the Fed pushing on a string with its cash . The Fed wasn't inducing consumption or real business investment in the economy with QE . What was the ultimate impact of Fed QE ? Well, just to start with, 2009, the first full year of QE, was the most profitable revenue year ever in Wall Street history . Let me repeat that . The most profitable revenue year ever in Wall Street history. It's incredible . Today our ""too big to fail"" banks ar e 37 percent bigger, generating 40 percent more income annually than they were before 2008 . Much of that remains fueled by their massive speculative investments in the financial markets, which may be distorting those markets, as Roger has alluded to . By 2010, in fact, the Fed began to speak with the impacts of QE differently . It starts adjusting that QE was benefiting America by artificially stimulating the financial markets and generating the wealth effects, fueling consumption by making more well -off Americans wealthier. B asically, that's trickle down economics, Fed style. And yet the claim of QE, helping average Americans , remains dubious . In 2013, McKinsey, the consulting firm, put out a study on the impact of Fed money printing, saying that for every $1 that Wall Street was being subsidized by QE, the average American household was los ing $2.50. The existential problem with Central Bank money printing is how the tool works . The transmission mechanism, pumping cash into Wall Street b anks, is inherently flawed. It doesn't create prosperity, or even if it does so marginally it's basically creating prosperity for people who don't need the help, the Jamie Dimons and Lloyd Blankfeinsof the world. It's not really helping that two thirds of Americans that are now living paycheck to paycheck . And unfortunately post financial crisis, what that really means is that money printing has only served to reinforce the reality of a chronically underperforming U.S . economy . In the end, Central Banks don't print prosperity . If anything, over time, money printing has only helped us kick the can of desperately needed reform further down the road. Thank you. Don't let our opponents hijack this debate . This is not a debate about whether the Fed should act as a lender of last resort in a run on the banks . We all agree with that point that they have made . And that's why they've taken this position, because you can't disagree with it . This is a debate about radical monetary policy that tries to print money in order to stimulate growth after a bank run in a recession. This is not QE1. This is QE -infinity . It's easiest to understand monetary policy by considering a simple corn economy . We can plant the corn . That's investment . We can eat it. That's consumption. Or we can store the corn in a silo and exchange it for a piece of paper that sa ys, “I owe you a bushel of corn.” That's money . Recessions occur when people get scared and start storing corn instead of eating it or planting it. Growth slows and unemployment rises . It's important to recognize the Fed doesn't grow corn, nor can it te leport corn back from the future and spend it today . All it can do is print IOUs . By printing more IOUs, monetary policy tries to change your behavior today . It motivates you to stop saving and start spending again . It does this by threate ning the value of your savings with price inflation in the future . With more IOUs outstanding, you shoul d logically run to the bank, to the silo, withdrawyour corn and use it before the economy recovers, people start exchanging IOUs for corn, and the sil os run low on corn, when prices rise and the dollar is worth less . But here is the rub . The Fed increased the monetary base from 800 billion to 4 trillion, an unprecedented fivefold increase in the monetary base, and it had no effect on anyone's sphere o f inflation whatsoever . No one ran to the banks to spend their savings . The money sat unused, neither lent nor borrowed, creating neither growth nor inflation. Why ? Because the Fed has promised to prevent inflation by contracting the money supply befor e the economy recovers and people start exchanging IOUs for corn. With hard fought decades of successfully defeating price inflation, the Fed has earned its credibility . And with the Republicans threatening the Fed's independence if it doesn't fight infl ation, the Fed's promise has even more credibility . Advocates of quantitative easing pretend that we can have our cake and eat it too, that we can scare savers into spending by printing money without needing to inflict the cost of inflation o n the economy after it recovers . But it didn't work when we needed the stimulus . Even Ben Bernanke now admits quantitative easing will only work if it's permanent, if it's guaranteed to inflict inflation on the economy . But nowhere does he advocate making quantitative easing permanent because of the damage it inflicts . And the Fed increased the monetary base while the government was pumping $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus into the economy, increasing debt from 30 percent of GDP to 70 percent. That's six times more than the trillion -dollar stimulus Krugman initially complained was too small. And even with aggressive fiscal stimulus, which advocates of stimulus contend is far more powerful than monetary stimulus, we saw no bounce back in growth whatsoever . Instead, we've seen tepid growth of a permanently lower base for six years and counting. It's true the Fed has recovered faster than Europe . But the U.S. has been growing faster than Europe for decades because of Silicon Valley and entrepreneurial risk taking . And for three decades and counting, Japan has tried the same thing; large fiscal deficits and near zero interest rates with nothing but slow growth to show for it . Now advocates of monetary policy insist, if the Fed recklessly throws the steering wheel out the window and balloons the monetary base to 9 trillion, that will scare everyone into spending . Perhaps it will. But the truth has been revealed. It takes a massive amount of monetary inflation to produce a miniscule increase in demand, enormous risk for little, if any, benefit. No mainstream economist takes these reckless proposals seriously . Our opponents will ignore these risks and claim only that lower interest rates and wealth effects stimulate investment, despite Ben Bernanke's admission that, ""Quantitative easing works in practice, just not in theory."" But the economists in the audience know that afterdecades of research there's no cons ensus whether interest rates, especially short -term overnight borrowing rates, affect real long -term investment. Why ? Because unused corn lowers interest rates and makes investment cheaper, not more paper IOUs . Roger speculates in his op- ed the quantitative easing may account for about an additional one -third of a percentage point reduction in the interest rate . Who believes a reduction in interest rates, especially a measly third of a percentage point, determines how fast Apple develops th e next generation iPhone? Like all companies, Apple can't afford not to innovate and invest as fast as it can, no matter the interest rate . Real increases in wealth might stimulate investment but nobody's fooled by equity prices inflated by low interest rates at an increased risk of inflation . If the Fed does nothing more than print IOUs, who here believes that increases wealth ? Phony IOUs increase risk . Risk reduces wealth . The economy may not be perfectly rational, b ut business leaders who create prosperity aren't stupid either . They surely don't increase investment and risk taking in the face of increased government spending and the risk of inflation. They dial back. There is simply no compelling evid ence that fiscal and monetary stimulus increases real business investment. If anything, the evidence shows the opposite, a dial back in business investment in the face of risky stimulus . And no surprise, in the wake of $3 trillion of monetary stimulus an d $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus, lackluster business investment and unusually slow productivity growth have been chief reasons for the slow recovery . Financial speculators, many who borrow short to buy long -term financial assets may be sensitiv e to short- term rates, doubly so given the amplifying effects of herd mentality . But financial arbitrage is a zero sum game that does nothing to grow the economy . Quantitative easing doesn't work in theory . That's why it doesn't work in practice either . After $4 trillion of quantitative easing, Ben Bernanke has reconsidered his view . Last month in the Wall Street Journal, he admitted, ""The Fed cannot print its way to prosperity because the Fed has no control over l ong-term economic fundamentals."" Don't let these guys fool you. There's no free lunch. Don't give reckless monetary policy a Band -Aid . Only hard work, investment, innovation, successful risk taking create prosperity . Side with Ben Bernanke and vote against the motion, Central B anks Can Print Their Way to Prosperity . Don't let these guys hijack the debate and make it a debate about whether the Fed should have bailed out the banking system . I was on TV last week telling everybody that the Fed needed to bail out the banking syste m. There isn't a serious economist on the planet who disagrees with that. And the reason why they've taken the debate there instead of to QE -infinity, what has occurredfor the six years after the bailout in the crisis is because it didn't work, and they know it. Vote against quantitative easing will create prosperity . It has created no prosperity."
for,"I think that's a fascinating and completely false claim. Milton Friedman was the preeminent monetary -- Edward Conard :Ben Bernanke said it, I might add. R oger Bootle : He did not say that. So Milton Friedman w as the preeminent monetary theorist of his or any generation . He's the person who created the way we think about money in the world today . And his central argument regarding the Great Depression was that the Federal Reserve should have printed money . And he's got plenty of theoretical papers that back that up. So it's the claim that there's no theoretical basis for this approach to thinking about money and credit is simply false."
against,"We can -- in a bank run, people run to the -- they get scared, they run to the bank to pull out their money . We can let the whole financial system collapse, or the Fed can print money, hand it to depositors, let them hold it for a second. The panic goes away . They redeposit the money in the bank, and we burn the money . If that's what we're going to debate, there's no debate here. The reason why we've gone there instead of to $4 trillion sitting -- 3 of the $4 trillion sitting in the bank unused is because it's much more difficult to win a debate about whether this can create prosperity . It's like stick a gun to my head. And I say, ""I could kill myself, but I didn't."" See? It creates prosperity, okay ? Yes. Milton Friedman was right, okay ? We did stupid stuff. We did stupid stuff in the 1930s that we all agree should not be repeated. What we want to debate today is whether or not, after that happens, and we bail out the banks,can we, through radical monetary policy, quantitative easing, which h as increase d the monetary base from 800 billion to 4 trillion because the Fed didn't burn the money after the money was returned to the banking system . They tried to create prosperity that way . The question is -- -- whether or not it worked."
for,"Yeah, you're spewing out all these numbers as though you're a central bank printing money . Actually, you completely misrepresente d Ben Bernanke's position. He has not recanted. The notion that he's given up on what he spent his life's work writing and doing , it's quite frankly absurd. What he meant by saying, if those were exactly the words he used, about Central Banks not being able to print prosperity was exactly what I was talking about earlier on . That's to say the contrast between the real sources of economic growth and the notion that Central Banks can't change those things dramatically . Of course they can't conjure up ma ssive amounts of technological progress or whatever . We all know that. That's not the issue . The issue is are there times when the monetary and financial system is on the brink of collapse ? Answer . Undoubtedly, ""Yes."" I'd like to know the answer . Un doubtedly, ""Yes."" E dward Conard : Don't let these guys go there . There's no -- R oger Bootle : And the second question is -- E dward Conard : -- data on that by any means . R oger Bootle : -- the second question is when those occasions happen, what do you think you should do ? Sit there and do nothing?E dward Conard : No."
against,"So, I mean, I was sitting there . And I was money printing . So, I mean, let me just tell you, I think we -- I -- R oger Bootle : --bully for you. I think we really need to be clear about what we're debating because I think we could go on for half an hour to having this same debate . Are we talking about the first $1.75 trillion of Fed monetary policy of quantitative easing or are we talking about the whole kit and caboodle? Because the -- Yeah, I mean, I -- if you look at my writing or speaking, I've always said it should have been QE1 and done . So the reality is the fact is the Fed ended QE1 at the beginning -- during 2009, and then it said, ""We're done . We're about to perhaps start raising rates very shortly."" And then a few months later when the stock market fell another 20 percent, the Fed came back and printed another -- over the next five years another $2.5 trillion of cash . So QE ended in America at the end of 2014 . I would not argue that the financial crisis ended in 2014 . We've had successive quarters of political economic growth . The Fed was actually advocating that a QE was a way to create jobs and create economic prosperity . And that's why I think we can start with one part, but I think we really need to go to the next. E dward Conard : This is a very thing he w as saying when he said ""It doe sn't work in theory --"""
for,"So the motion is, ""Central Banks Can Print Prosperity."" Andrew just conceded the motion on the QE1 . Now we'll work on Ed."
against,"I conceded that banks -- that the Fed can help stabilize banks but ultimately that in terms of a larger prosperity, in terms of central banks aroun d the world having printed over $7 trillion and still printing more money, we are not doing the job in terms of actually helping the average person . We can go on more about distortions, but I think we just first need to get the key players -- S imon Johnson : Andrew, what did Milton Friedman say about the Great Depression and ab out the monetary cause of the Great Depression ? And are you saying that Milton Friedman was wrong about the monetary cause of the Great Depressi on? Andrew. A ndrew Huszar : I don't think-- S imon Johnson : Andrew -- E dward Conard :- believe in Milton Friedman's theory anymore , I to tell you the truth. And, by the way, when you really go back to the 1930s, why did employment go up? We conscripted every body and sent them to the Second World War. We really got lousy growth throughout the 1930s no matter what we did, because when we talk about monetary policy, after we solved the bank run, it is highly deb atable about whether it works . And Ben Bernanke was talking about ""It works in theory, not in practice."" He was talking not about bailing out the banks . He was talking about ""Afterwards will it stimulate growth?"" And even in his book today he argues, because he's trying to justify his position, that ""In an economy that is not at full capacity can we scare everybody with inflation into spending their savings in order to get back to full capacity?"" He was not debating bailouts, okay ? And the reason why these guys are going to stick to bailouts and stay there is because they don't have a good argument on the more interesting part of this issue . The audience can let them hijack the debate . I predicted in the first sentence of an opening befo re we even started this d ebate."
for,"Well, I think I've said what I wanted to say on this, and there's no doubt, whatsoever, that Ben Bernanke has not changed his position. He's not recanted . The opposition are trying to suggest that he's undergone a complete volte -face which is total and complete nonsense . Now, of course, there are different sorts of QE . There are different stages in QE . The motion doesn't say, by the way, ""This H ouse Believes That Central Banks Can Print Prosperity Limited to QE1 or 2,"" or whatever. It says, ""Central Banks Can Print Prosperity."" Why are you narrowing it down to some particula r episode?"
against,"Because --Roger Bootle: To distort the debate? Well, first of all, I want to have a good debate . So let's -- Yeah, but -- no, but I -- but let's look at the numbers . I mean, what we're -- if you really want to talk about QE, the stages of QE, the first stage of QE that was th e, ""Let's put out the fire,"" stage of QE ended in basically -- in 2010 . And we've gone on - - we went on for four more years . And so, I think, from a time perspective and from a money printing perspective, the vast majority of money printing happened when we all agreed that the crisis was over and the central banks around the world have begun to try to stimulate growth and stimulate employment . And I think that's where we've seen -- -- massive distortions -- -- and massive opaque Wall Street subsidies."
for,"If this were a Woody Allen movie, Be n Bernanke would walk out on stage now, I think . That would be actually quite good. John Do nvan: -- It's certainly straightforward . It's very straightforward. This is a debate. There are rules . There's a motion . The motion is very simply -- I -- let me -- I'm answering the question. The last time I was here, John, you cut me off at a critical moment a couple of years ago . So, let's not go through that again . The motion is -- That was -- oh – ."
against,"-- playing chess . Okay? And I say a queen is more valuable than a pawn. And you show me a position where I can sacrifice my queen and save the pawn . Say “See ? Pawns are more valuable than queens.” Okay ? They have found a position which we all agree with, that we need to bail out the banks in a crisis, okay ? We -- you can let them hijack the debate and have the point. We agree with the point . Nobody debates the point. Some crazy guys, you know, in the Republican primary might debate the point . I don't know. Nobody --John Donvan: I have to -- I have to -- What we're really engaging in -- -- is money printing -- -- to create growth. We agree with the -- Every time.John Donvan: In your very technical, dry sense of the motion, they just lost because they said it worked that one time . Okay. You can go ahead and do that -- If you let them hijack the debate. And the reason they're hijacking it is because it's really tough to -- -- defeat the other --"
for,"Well, first of all, on this point about the money still sitting on the books of the banks -- this is a simple theoretical point you've got to get clear. The banks can't get rid of the money. Whether the policies work ed or not work -- the money is going to sit there on the books of the banks . So, you saying, you know, the money is sitting there on the banks' bo oks means nothing whatsoever . Now, on the point where -- .John Donvan: I just want clarification from what he means by it. It means nothing whatsoever ? You have 30 seconds, and then we're going back to Roger."
against,"Give me something. All right? trillion dollars in the U.S., of 4 trillion has been printed and is sitting in the banks . And actually, the banks are making, right now, about $8 billion a year just by banking at the Fed. So there is a -- there is an actual consequence . There's some bonuses going out because of it, at a minimum."
for,"Well, this is just basic monetary economics, I'm afraid . The banks collectively cannot get rid of the stuff. Bank One tries to get rid of it by betting down for deposits or lending it or buying securities . What does that do ? It passes it on to other banks . There's no way that the banking system collectively can extinguish the money . So simply saying that the money's still sitting on banks' books does not advance your argument at all."
against,But there's very few ways to measure this.
for,"No . Now, the notion that it hasn't worked very well, it certainly hasn't worked perfectly . I must say, it would be a rather strange expectation, I think, to have a broken financial system . You pump money in and whoosh, suddenly everything works perfectly . Of course, it didn't work perfectly . But in looking back at the evidence, y ou’d think thatAmerica was feeling recession . In fact, what happened is you've had a pretty decent recovery . You've had millions of jobs created . Okay. There are bankers that have earned obscene and absurd amounts of money . And I am no defender of that and I'm pretty sure Simon isn't, either . But you mustn't conflate these two. Just -- just because the central bank has created money that hasn't automatically gone into --"
against,"I think we can measure how much money has been used. It's very easy, and it gets to the question of prosperity . One is to look at business investment as a percentage of GDP . It's been tepid. We've seen no rebound . In it, it has gradually come back slowly over seven years . If this works, quantitative easing, or fiscal stimulus, we should have seen a rebound . We saw no rebound whatsoever . We can also look at mortgage lending as another example, which is what banks predominantly do . Mortgage lending is way down from where it was in the past . We can look at business lending from the banks . There hasn't been a lot of business lending from the banks . And so by real measures of the economy, we know that the economy is down. And it's not like we saw in normal recessions, a rebound and then growth. We went down unusually to a very low base, and we have had be low average growth from that base onward . So we have seen no rebound off the lower base . And if you're going to make the argument that quantitative easing will create more lending, it will create more business activity, it will stimulate business investm ent all the things that create prosperity, you have to show some evidence that in fact it has accomplished that. But we have seven years, six or seven years of data that we can look at, and we can see –"
for,"So now I think Ed is conceding the substance of the motion to us. So -- so let me explain . Let me explain why . Let me explain why . Let me explain wh y, John . So we agree -- he just stated very clearly, that there has been -- or he said -- he discussed the consequences of the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s . That it was the crisis that brought down investment that brought down employment, that destroyed businesses . I would remind everyone that in the fall of 2008, there was no credit to be had on reasonable terms for almost anyone, individual or firm in this economy . And that was the financial crisis . The response to financial crisis, Ed m entioned lender of last resort. What that means, and I think we would agree on that is, when you lend to firms that are about to fail . So specific lending to specific firms . That was part of the response in 2008 . But the real response was to push back and to resist the collapse of credit . This is where the printing of money -- so the printing of money, the creation of money that goes into the financial system, eases credit, makes credit more available, lo wers interest rates of various -- m ak es it possible to get a mortgage, makes it possible to have a credit card, take out a student loan. All of that comes from the monetary system and the financial system . And the response at the Federal Res erve is what Andrew was doing, and he was worki ng very hard on, and I know it was frustrating, and it didn't go as well as it might have, but it was the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression."
against,"So I want to make a really sort of pragmatic point, because I think a lot of times when you have debates like this, you get into high theoretical, very well intentioned debates . But I want to talk about the actu al transmission mechanism. I think Ed made a really good point, which is that you actually – s omeone has to explain how quantitative easing works . And when I was in the Fed, it wasn't just that I was losing hair or getting frustrated . It was the reality t hat what we were seeing was we were pumping a lot of cash into the big Wall Street banks with the intention, potentially, of credit easing, of improving the credit conditions for the average American . And what the banks were doing instead and what they've continued to do over the last seven years, effectively, is to use that cash for their own speculative purposes . And so in terms of the actual knock- on impact and knock -on benefits to the man on the street, those did not actually manifest themselve s. So if you look at that -- I have a couple of facts . So basically, over the last seven years, you've seen the big Wall Street banks basically increase their lending from 7.3 trillion to 8.1 trillion, so about 10 percent . And you've seen them actually just increase their bond holdings, their speculative bond holdings from 2.1 to 3.7 trillion. That's 75 percent. And that's not even the stocks that they're buying and the that they're buying."
for,"Yes, the fact that the banks have used some or even indeed all of the money to buy bonds doesn't prove anything at all, frankly. It doesn't negate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy whatsoever . In buying bonds, adding to the demand for bonds in the market, they've raised the price of bonds, lowered the rate of interest on bonds . And of course, they bought the bonds from someone or other. And that's pushing the monetary impulse all the way through the economy."
against,"I f the price of credit is going down, and they're not lending on some level, again, we're seeing that there's not a -- we're pushing -- pushing on a string, right? I disagree. -- not able to be done on consumption or on investment. I disagree with both these guys . What makes lending easier -- what makes lending easier -- I'll take it . What makes lending easier is corn in the silos, not printing IOUs, okay? You can print all the IOUs you want, and they're going to sit in the bank unused, the money, the real savings, are sitting in the bank . They haven't been loaned out. They haven'tbeen used to fund business investment. They hav en't been used to increase mortgages, to raise construction . We see no increase in construction what banks traditionally do . Okay ? It's not printing IOUs that makes loans cheaper and easier to get . It's having real savings and a real economy . It's not accounting. Accounting can facilitate it in weird ways like, for example, in a financial crisis, when everybody's grabbing their money trying to withdraw it from the bank . But on an ongoing basis, what the Fed has tried to do over the last s ix years, okay, is print IOUs. It hasn't created a nickel of bushel of corn in the silo . It has not made it easier or harder to lend."
for,"Yeah . Ed, are you in favor of the gold standard ? These are --"
against,"But, no, of course not."
for,-- exactly the gold standard --
against,"This is another example of setting up the silly strawman and trying to debate against a strawman . And the reason for it is -- -- because they can't defend QE -- -- beyond their bank run. So what I would say -- I just have a very quick response to that which is, again, if we want to talk about the knock- on impacts and the real numbers, since 2008 in America we have a 70 percent consumer spending economy, right ? We all know this. In America, over the last seven years, the rate of growth of consumer spending has been 1.7 percent, which is the most anemic consumer growth on record in the history of the United States . So to the extent that we not only have fiscal stimulus, but we actually have had massive money printing . Apparently, it's not really trickling down to the people who are actually buying things."
for,"These are very cheap, rhetorical techniques . I'm disappointed that a New York audience would fall for this . Anyway… So we -- the economy collapsed . The economy -- we had a very deep financial crisis --"
against,"If it would have worked, we would have seen a rebound like we see in every other recession -- I do not a gree with that. I think it was -- I think it actually had basically no impact . And -- but -- and I will even say the Fed itself -- S imon Johnson : Zero impact, quantitative easing had zero impact . Now we'r e getting to the real question. During QE2, the Fed actually changed the rationale for basically what it was doing . It stopped talking about credit easing because it actually wasn't stimulating credit creation to buy your Apple iPhone . It started talking about the fact that it was generating a wealth effect, that it is actually -- by pumpingmoney into Wall Street banks and seeing all of these speculative investme nts, it was actually --and buying assets itself, it was actually increasing investment demand for assets, and pushing up prices of all assets, all the stock markets, all the bond markets. And basically that's been the argument of the Fed basically since QE2 started . And, ultimately, I would argue that reflects partially the failure of QE1 to do what it was supposed to do beyond stabilizing the banks, and, two, it show s you basically where there's much more distortionary effects basically over time . And we can get into that."
for,"Andrew, are you saying quantitative easing had zer o effects on the economy?"
against,"No . What I would say is that it actually benefitted the Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimons of the world, and I would say that actually in -- if it actually did make any impact by increasing stock markets in the U.S. in which 20 percent of Americans own, the top 20 percent own 80 percent of stocks or where it actually potentially is increasing i ncome ine quality , and it's potentially where savings rates have -- you know, where all of us -- our savings accounts are basically at zero. McKinsey has estimated has actually penalized average Americans over $400 billion in forfeited savings on their savings a ccounts. So I would actually argue maybe it's actually hurting the middle class and obviously disproportionately benefitting the rich and the banks."
for,"Well, I think what it did was it helped to make credit more freely available . It boosted confidence and activity in the financial system . And the process of that boosted probably both consumption and investment spending . In other words, it strengthened the forces of economic recovery i n the country. Now, that hasn't been a benefit to every American, but look at the number of jobs created . You've got to take a view on what the situation would have been like without this assistance . As Simon said, we'd experienced the worst financial c risis since the Great Depression. We've had a recovery . During that process of recovery, what's the policy been? Actually the policy has been not just to keep interest rates very low but to pump money into the economy, and for all sorts of w ays, which is there in the textbook, which has been explained this evening, that policy works to increase the flow of credit, increase demand in the economy . The previous question was exactly right . The point is about demand, not supply . With increased demand that enables the economy to grow more strongly."
against,"I think -- I under -- I -- what -- - - was that, in his opinion, he -- I'm saying, he's just giving an opinion, because he doesn't really have an argument that he can make here . And what I tell you is the reason why we say the theory doesn't work -- it only works in practice -- is because despite them telling you that it's in all the textbooks, the theo ry is exchanging one IOU, a bushel of corn, for another IOU, a bushel of corn -- government debt . You have to go, “What's the big deal on the exchange?” And when they pretend that writing IOUs improves credit, no . What improves credit is having corn in t he silos available to be used . Not printing phony IOUs, which causes everybody to go, “Oh Oh. I need to be very careful here. I need to dial back my spending . I need to dial back investment. I need to slow down and be very careful here because there's no more cornin the silos than there was yesterday . There's just a bunch of phony IOUs out there . And I need to be concerned.” And the theory is, you'll run to the bank and pull your savings out, and spend it -- J ohn Donvan: Okay. -- because you're worried about inflation."
for,"So, as I think, Melissa, you're asking the right question . You know, what does it do for the middle class ? What does it do for middle Americans? And the answer is, “Not enough.” And you know, and we have a lot of inequality . And perhaps this policy exacerbated that. I take Ben Bernanke at his word when he said this policy was for Main Street, not for Wall Stre et. But we have an extremely skewed financial system, and you know very well how it works and who benefits the most, both on the downturn and on the upturn. But honestly, if you put the central bank in a straitjacket -- and this is the real agenda here; this is where this is going in the broader debate in this country -- you put the central bank in a straitjacket, that is not going to be good over the cycle that were faced by these crises, for exactly middle class Americans."
against,"I mean, 5 percent of Americans have gotten 95 percent of the benefits . And I would say this has exacerbated that. What really happens is it lowers interest rates . So, anybody who's saving for their child's retire -- for their child's education, or their retirement, or they're a senior living off their interest -- all those people have been hurt by zero interest rates, if you think that that really controls interest rates . And it's -- and so, it might transfer money from one group to another, but it's not creating prosperity by writing “I owe you a bushel of corn.” Corn creates --"
for,"This is wrong and it's starting to get very dangerous . 13 million jobs created, right? Where did the jobs come from? How do you create the jobs with no credit in the economy ? You don't . You wouldn't get your job. E dward Conard : There'd be plenty of credit in the economy. The -- look, there they go with distraction again . Focus on the j obs. What helps the middle class Americans ? What do middle class Americans need more than anything else ? They need a decent job at a decent wage . It's a struggle -- as it is . If you destroy the credit system, and if you don't let the central bank respond to that, and to keep supporting the credit system in the way they've tried to do -- it's not perfect, but that's how you get the jobs back."
against,"So, I mean, here's what I would say . Again, I would say the Fed in Washington stabi lized Wall Street, post 2008. We have seen -- we'd have a financial crisis where basically the average American had had stagnating wages for over 20 years, had taken on more Wall Street credit to try to maintain the same standard of living . What we saw in 2008, ultimately, was that the average American wasn't able to sustain that level of Wall Street credit . We had a big financial crisis . And after the stabilization, what the Fed has effectively tried to do is pump money through Wall Street banks in order to create prosperity, right ? And ultimately, that is like a doctor prescribing a medicine that, on some level, kind of works, but has a lot of unintended consequences . You know, it's like so much Viagra th at at some point, you start having these erections that last more than four hours . Okay ? And the reality is what you're having is -- you're having massive Wall Street subsidies and you're having -- you know, perhaps the rich are getting richer. But really, we're not seeing wealth effects trickle down to the average American . In fact, I would argue, we're seeing these wealt h effects by pumping up the the stock markets, by all these -- all this money printing . It's ultimately --"
for,"Look, I'm not a friend of the big banks . The last time I was on this stage, I was arguing to break up the big banks . That was a position of the motion that I was supporting . That's what -- that's what I lost on, okay ? This is not about Wall Street. This is not about Wall Street and helping -- No . I don't think that amounts to prosperity, and I'm not convinced indeed that it adds to prosperity . There's a strain in this debate, whereby someone says, look, there are all sorts of problem in America that haven't been solved . You know, my garage door doesn' t work. You know -- you know, go back to the gammy leg and the gammy . You know, what did QE do for me ? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . We know that there are all these problems in the U.S . economy . Most of them have got nothing whateve r to do with the monetary system . That's not the question. The question is, given all that, all those awful things eating away at jobs, diminishing the middle class incomes, given all that, what should monetary policy have done ? And has monetary policy contributed toameliorating those problems in some regard ? Has it made them worse, or has it left them completely unaltered? And I think the evidence is pretty clear what monetary policy has done . It hasn't solved all those problems . It couldn't possibly do it. What it's done is helped to sustain the growth of demand and exactly, as Simon says, in the end, that amounts to jobs, the most important thing of all."
against,"So just to level set here, but the bank of -- QE was also undertaken in the UK . The Bank of England did its own report. They did about a trillion dollars of QE . I can't do an English accent . But I will tell you what they actually wrote about sort of the monetary policy and its impact in the macro economy . It says ""the benefit of wealth effects --"" which is what we're talking about "" -- will accrue to those households holding the most assets. Distributional consequences and its benefits will not be shared equally among all individuals."" And that's the problem, right? We do actually have to talk about the transmission mechanism, how these tools actually work."
for,"The Independent Community Bank of America recently voted me one of their Main Street heroes . Some applause would go over there. I t was not because I wa s supporting more inequality or more money for the big banks or even stock buybacks . It's because I was supporting a better credit system which, as you know, has many different parts that are interconnected. You're talking about one manifestation of the ease your credit policies pursuing , and you're right, that was one manifestation . But thecredit system, as you know, is much broader than that, has a lot of small banks, has a lot of small business lending, has a lot of lending to households and to individual consumers . That's part of what was supported by the Federal Reserve also . And I'm sorry your garage door is still not working, Andrew, at least what I heard."
against,"I agree . So, first of all, there has been job growth . I mean, I think I'm very heartened by that, as we all are . Again, I think you have to ask yourself, over 6 or 7 years how much of that would have happened organically at a certain point. But in terms of -- I think this is -- this is what the Fed's perspective inside is, right? These are smart, well-intentioned people . And what they think is, listen, the rest of Washington is dysfunctional, and at least we're doing something to help. And the real questio n is whether what they're doing to help, over time, is actually helping, or whether actually perhaps is creating more distortions and perhaps by -- if it is pumping up financial markets, it's actually creating some complac ency about an America in which more than half -- two -thirds of American is are living paycheck to paycheck . And I think, you know, Goldman Sachs, which is no bastion of reform, you know, had a quote basically where it said -- a couple weeks ago, it had an article ju st about this in my report . And it said, basically central bank support create opportunities for othereconomic actors to shirk their responsibilities . And I think that's a huge issue that we have to ask ourselves . By pumping so much money into Wall Street banks, are we ultimately helping or are we just kicking the can down the road in terms of more reform, and perhaps even, as Simon Johnson would lament as well, are we actually enabling the further growth and power of the U.S . financial sector to the expense of other parts of the economy? I think there is important political questions about how big the government should be, to what extent should we redistribute income, to what extent should the government stim ulate demand, and whether or not we should let politicians control the money supply . Long ago we decided it was not a good idea to let the politicians control the money supply . But I think on the other issues, you might be frustrated with what Congress h as come up with . But what you're proposing is taking the power away from Congress and giving it to the head of the Federal Reserve who is accountable to nobody . I think in the long run, if you damage democracy in that way, I think it's naive to think that that's going to create prosperity in the long run. And to have an end- around by the Fed and try to usurp the Congress' power and take it away from the people and give to it one guy who's accountable to nobody, and that somehow in the long ru n is going to increase prosperity, because maybe it had some brief short -term effect."
for,"-- for some people, but that's the right way to think about it. Ben Bernanke went to Milton Friedman's 90th birthday party . He said, with regard to the Great Depression, ""we did it . We were responsible, the Federal Reserve . We're sorry, and we won't do it again."" And he meant that the Federal Reserve had not created money in the face of that financial panic . And everything that came after it, including the collapse of real activity . And they didn't do it again. Ben Bernanke and his colleagues saved the day . Now, it was a mess. It was a disaster. Ben Bernanke talksabout that too . But it was better than it would otherwise have been . That's what Bernanke says . Bernanke's absolutely -- we're on Bernanke's side. John Donva n: Andrew Huszar."
against,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought E d was going to go first. I think Ben Bernanke flat out says that printing money cannot create prosperity . He says it works in theory, but it doesn't work in practice . And now he says QE will onl y work if it's permanent if it actually inflicts inflation on the -- if it's guaranteed to inflict inflation on the economy in the long run. I think he's backed way off of his position that got him the name, ""Helicopter Ben."" You can read the New Yorker Magazine on A dair Turner's book, and it says, ""He no longer mentions the theories that he put forward in the past."" You can read his book, 500 pages of what he has to say about quantitative easing now, and you'll see that the things I said are true."
for,"Yeah . We heard earlier on that if this were a Woody Allen film, Ben Bernanke would suddenly appear . Well, unfortunately he can't appear, but he has taken the trouble to tell me what he really meant -- -- what he would have said had he been here, which is that he did absolutely the right thing . The policy made things an awful lot better than they would otherwise have been . And he hasn't recanted at all."
against,"So, you know, Ben Bernanke, before the financial crisis, talked about how this was the great moderation, how activist monetary policy was going to save the day and would never really allow for a financial crisis to happen again . We saw how that went. Post financial crisis, he started talking about how we see how monetary policy works in -- doesn't work in theory, but it works in practice . And basically all the statements since have been similarly confused. Two years ago this week, I wrote an op -ed in the Wall Street journal in which I apologized for my role in quantita tive easing and argued that the Fed was literally papering over the issue of a chronically underperforming U.S . economy. Ladies and gentlemen, the U.S . continues to register devastating declines in the underlying conditions for economic growth. We are now 15th in the world in infrastructure, 19th in the world in college graduation rates . The quality of our Tax Code is rated among dead last among all 34 OECD countries . The list goes on and on . After my op -ed, many friends from inside the Fed expressed confusion. Didn't I see the dysfunction in the rest of Washington? Wasn't it better that someone was doing something rather than nothing ? Again, I respect the Fed and the people inside, but what I responded to them is exactly what Ben Bernanke himself has said, that QE is not a panacea, or as Simon J ohnson’s old employer the IMF, has repeatedly warned, an overreliance on accommodative monetary policy without stepping up the pace of structural reform is un likely to lead back to normal growth . The ultimate tragedy of money printing is not that it might disproportionately benefit Jamie Dimon or Lloyd Blankfein, as unfair as that may be . It's that if it does work at all by artificially stimulating banks and financial markets, it's sowing c omplacency about the crumbling economic welfare of the average citizen . In other words, I'd submit the narrative here in America is not that the Fed did something while the rest of Washington did nothing . It's that over time, the Fed did so much that the rest of Washington could get away with doing so little . And please feel free to insertthe capital of Japan and Europe into that sentence . Ladies and gentlemen, before you vote, I ask you to think about what prosperity really means . Is it more prosperity for all? Or if money printing even works, is it more prosperity for just the most privileged, at best ? And I implore you to vote against the motion. Thank you."
for,"I sat recently before a committee of the House of R epresentatives that was considering a version of exactly this question . And the way that works is actually very similar to this room, except you down low, an audience not quite as big as this audience, is up above you, looking down on you . And the people next to me -- well, unfortunately, Roger wasn't there -- everybody sitting next to me, on both sides, actually, was expressing some version of the views that you're hearing from Ed and from Andrew . And you know, sometimes you may see these hearings, you may hear about them, and you think, “Well, that's kind of strange and it's somewhat abstract” and so on. But this is really where policy gets debated and where you see policy being made . And this hearing went on for hours . And it went on for hours becau se one side of the room -- and let me say, it was the right -hand side of the room – -- wanted to repeat and reiterate exactly these points . And they wanted to hammer me with the same ki nd of criticisms that have been thrown at us tonight -- and much worse, I have to say . Much worse. You know, I think tonight, when you vote, right now -- you will send a message. And the message will either be that even in New York, people have lost confi dence in the central bank, the Federal Reserve system, and its power should be curtailed . And you will give -- if you do that, if you vote that way, you will give great support to the people who right now -- right now -- are proposing legislation, that are goi ng to put really binding constraints on monetary policy and on the Federal Reserve's ability to act and respond to crises . I urge you to vote in favor of the motion, Central Banks Can Print Prosperity .Can, under some circumstances, print prosperity . That's what we've been arguing . That's w hat the world needs to hear from you tonight . Thank you."
against,"Liberal Berkeley economist Brad DeLong recently described each side of the motion we're debating . About our opponents' view, he said, “Even though the Fed printed much more money than economists would have thought necessary to offset the impact of the financial crisis, a fivefold increase in the monetary base, from 800 billion to 4 trillion, it wasn't enough . Bernanke balked taking the next step, more than doubling the monetary base to $9 trillion.” End quote . Roger has publicly described a far more modest U.K . Proposal as dangerous and delusional, arguing that, quote, “Sometimes the sovereign has no alternative to inflationary finance, but this always has significant costs . And it's never the place to start or end.” Our view of monetary policy -- Berkeley's DeLong said, quote, “Larry Summers and Paul Krugman argue that there is little evidence that monetary policy will ever restore full prosperity.” End q uote. DeLong admits, he doesn't know which one of these views is correct. Why doesn't DeLong know which one of these views is correct ? Because $3 trillion of printing has produced no discernible effect on the economy . And if it had, DeLong would have seen it and he would be urging more . Our opponents can't bring any more evidence to the debate that central banks can print their way to prosperity than what Summers, Krugman, and DeLong have already considered . If the evidence hasn't persuaded even those ardent advocates of stimulus, why should it persuade you? Bernanke now flat -out admits central banks cannot print their way to prosperity . Our opponents have the burden of proving the motion through a very tough burden in this case . They haven't made a convincing argument, because no one can make a convincing argument on this issue . I urge you to vote against the far -fetched motion, Central Banks Can Print Their Way to Prosperity . And I would point out that I believe that our opponents ha ve tried to corner the debate – -- okay ? But when we broaden -- but wait. When we broaden the debate to the real issue, they were able to do little more than offer their opinion that it had -- -- more positive effect --"
