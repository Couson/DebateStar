against,"My partner is the lovely, talented, and charming David Weinberger. Yeah, pretty well. The most important point that we make -- because it was coauthored -- was that the web is actually a s ocial place, although it didn't look like it at the time . What we got -- one of the things we got very wrong was that we didn't know we would have to fight to keep the web the way it was. I am a very shaded if not shady -- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Nick and -- so if Nick is right, and our technology is having this physical effect on our physical brain, keeping us from being able to form knowledge out of information, then why is this -- it seems to me to that this is -- this is the greatest time in human history to be somebody who cares about knowledge . This is -- this is a renaissance of knowledge . If we take the question, ""Is our smart tech making us dumb,"" I want to not even refute that. I want to ask, why do we keep asking that? Because if ""smart"" means that we make good decisions, then we are -- new predictive technologies, very smart -- enable us to do that. If being smart means understanding more, we now have from the Higgs boson to the Hubb le telescope, we have the ability through our smart technology to understand more about a universe that's 14 billion years old . And if ""smart"" means better at our work, then I absolutely, and you absolutely , want your doctor, your auto mechanic, and your airplane pilot to have the smartest technology that there is . So why do we have ask? I think in part it's because of the shock of the new . And this is very, very new, what's going on . Andy Clark is a philosopher who makes a point that we don't know, we don't think in our heads .Intelligence Squared: 11 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb We think with things in the world, out in the world . So a mathematician thinks with chalk on a blackboard . An architect thinks with models in her hands or using a straight edge or something . And a meteorolo gist who is using our old tech, who just has a weather vane is not going to be nearly as smart as a meteorologist who's gather data from sensors around the world, big data put to use to predict the weather down to the hour . That's really, really smart. And it's our smart technology t hat lets us do that. If Clark is right, and I think he is, that we think of objects out in the world, and if those tools change, and if they change radically, then the way that we think changes radically, which is why I t hink we even consider the possibility that our smart tech is making us dumb when all the evidence seems to be that in fact we are smarter in the important ways than ever. Another reason perhaps we entertain this notion is that we have a natural tendency to think that the technology we grew up with is natural and is good . But that's not the case . We didn't invent gatekeepers because we said -- in the old world, in a prior world -- we didn't invent gatekeepers because we thought it was just a swell idea to vastly limit the amount of information and knowledge that we were going to make public, and we didn't say, ""You know what would be really swell? Let's create a set of homogenous white guys, and they'll decide what makes it through tho se gates.” We invented gatekeepers because the old medium, that technology of paper, was so limited . It had gates, and the gates were really, really narrow . And so we needed to have gatekeepers . But now we don't. Now the gates are down. We have this huge abundance, and we adopt new strategies for that. And sometimes it's disconcerting. One of the main strategies is that we skim . We skim a lot. That's actually a really adaptive technology -- technique for dealing with it. And it's not even an old technique. It's a technique that we use when we go into an old -fashioned real bookstore and there are thousands of titles, and we skim them on the shelves really quickly to find what we're interested -- and that -- so we still do that now . We're doing it online . And just as then, when we find something that's interesting to us, we are able to drill down into it . We start reading it. It's -- in this age of constant distraction, we can't focus , w e're watching seven years of ""Game of Thrones,"" the most complex narrative that we've ever seen in our world . And I'll see you Sunday night . It's great . We love this stuff. Our children are reading seven volumes of complex, intricate narrative and characterization . Our universities ar e turning out experts and scholars who are deep into their topics , deeper than ever because they can go that deep because of the internet. So I don't think the evidence is there, despite the brain chemistry , that we are in fact not knowing . We are knowing more and better than ever .Intelligence Squared: 12 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb If you think back to the 1980s, for example, you get a newspaper, you'd read the article, you'd find something, you'd read an article . It was really exciting, you wanted to know more . You want -- but you can't because it's 1980 . And all you've got was that rectangle of print. That's what it was like before we had smart technology . You were just stuck. It's infuriating even to think about at this point . That's not right. It's certainly not natur al. So let me give you an example : 1911, with the -- sorry, Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica had its first article on Oliver Goldsmith, the playwright, 6,000 words long . Each new edition, that gets shorter because they've got to cram in more stuff. By 1994, it's down to 1,500 words which means that it's -- the editors of the Britannica, the gate keepers of knowledge and culture, have thrown out 75 percent of what Britannica knows about Goldsmith, because that's how paper works . Wikipedia article, it's 1,400 words, but you've got to count all of the -- look into all of the links, decide which ones of those count in the total for Goldsmith . You can do the apples to apples . It's -- and there will be much more . And people will dis agree about what -- which of those links count, which is fine, because in Wikipedia and on the web overall, knowledge is no longer crammed into rectangles . They assume a much more natural sh ape , which is that of a web, which is -- has near infinite capacity . It enables us to accommodate much more complexity of relationships, indefinite complexity, is much bigger than any one brain could ever have made . And we get to see how the knowledge is made, which is in many ways very disconcerting . We see that it's human. It's a human product. It's full of fallibility, we see the people are arguing, they're adding, they're getting things wrong, they're getting things right. That's how knowledge is made . That's how knowledge was always made . But now we can see it . It's in our face. And that's a truth. That's a truth about knowledge that was always true of knowledge . But now that we can see it, we're beginning -- it's an amazing thing . We're beginning to invent and discover together new ways of building knowledge, of talking together and building knowledge . This has -- we've never been in a period like this before. But it may -- it's upsetting because now we have to face the truth that knowledge has always, always been a human product and always, therefore, subject to and characterized by the fallibility of humans . So it seems clear to me that to argue that our smart tech is making us dumb is not only to be on the wrong side of history; in this case, it's to be on the w rong side of evolution. So I urge you to vote against the proposition and to do so emphatically.Intelligence Squared: 13 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s",nan

against,"It's on right now.Intelligence Squared: 14 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Perhaps it's fitting that it falls to a woman and an Australian to rebut that particular moment. I find myself delightfully, at the end of this conversation, thinking about the proposition, is smart technology making us dumb? I think it's probably ironic that we started this debate using a smart device to vote on that proposition , and that most of you in the room said you had smart technology on your persons, even though you've now disabled it for radio . When I was given the task of taking on this proposition, as someone who did debate in high school -- which is a long time ago -- I was struck by the impulse to want to deconstruct the question. It's an anthropological approach too, right? And ask ""What is smart technology?"" Echoing Andrew's concern of what on earth that might mean . What does “ dumb” mean? Is smart /dumb the only binary pair that we could have, and is dumb necessarily, as an anthropologist, I might want to ask, a bad thin g? I mean, clearly we're putting a set of cultural and moral values around dumbness that are interesting . Smart technology is now being described as romantic,Intelligence Squared: 17 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb progressive, reactionary, a rectangle, and a gatekeeper, all of which is an interesting set of a baggage to put on a phone, the Internet, algo rithms, the internet of things, and big data. Nonetheless, we have done that. So, David said to me, ""No, Genevieve, don't deconstruct the argument .” So I'm taking his advice . I am , however, going to want to suggest that smart technology has made us smart in some unexpected ways . It's made us more responsive . It's made us more engaged . And in the case of both Andrew and I, it's made us more enraged and I'm not necessarily convinc ed that's a bad thing . So, how might I go about proving that? Well, I think there's a couple of places you'd look to . And many of them are outside of this room, and Manhattan, and outside of the United States . Smart technology makes us smart and it makes us safer. If you were to look, in the last year, I can pull you examples from all over the world . In many African countries and on the Indian subcontinent, mobile phones and text messages are used by governments to send out health warnings and prev entative health messages . When the Ebola outbreak was taking place, messages were sent on smartphones to tell people how to handle themselves, their communities, and the bodies that they were encountering . Hardly dumb, right? In Australia, where I come f rom, all the volunteer fire services, which is how we keep ourselves safe in the fire season, use a geo -located app service that sends out notifications to Australians to tell them there's a bush fire near them, to tell them what to do in a high -fire dange r day, which isn't always obvious. And how to think about being safer and ultimately smarter about how we inhabit a dangerous landscape . In the United States, you have the A mber alert, something I'm sure many of you hope to neve r see on your telephones . But when you do, you know what to do . It's about making a community and the kids in it hopefully safer and ultimately making all of us smarter about danger . And it will be hard to argue with what’s happened in Nepal over the la st three and a half weeks as people have mobilized all sorts of technology to bring both relief and comfort to a community that was clearly struggling . In all of those cases, is smart technology making us dumber? I hardly think so . And if you were to mo ve further out from that frame and think about cultural knowledge, we talked a lot about intelligence, we talked a lot about book learning . But let's think a little bit about cultural knowledge . I'm the child of an anthropologist. I grew up with indigenous people in Australia. I spent a lot of time in indigenous communities, and it's been fascinating to watch over the last 20 years asIntelligence Squared: 18 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb those communities have embraced new technologies to do old things . The Ngadjuri with whom my family have worked for the last 20 years, used the internet to tell their stories . They like the fact that newspapers are being archived because they can use the stories in those about their colonial contact and argue about how t o regain their land. The Diri and the Kukuda are using IOT sensors to combine traditional knowledge about climate with state -based knowledge about climate change to think about how to occupy their land better . And the Anangu in central Australia have an electronic medical records system that is a marvel of the world and has changed the health outcomes in that community . Is smart tech, in those instances, making those communities dumber? I hardly think so. And is it about a vacuum and people just talking to each other? I don't think that's the right way to think about it, either . Moving closer to home, at Intel, we're deeply concerned about diversity in the tech community, about diversity in STEM educ ation . And one of our challenges frequently is to convince young women and ethnic minorities that there's room for them inside the sciences . And one of the ways you do that is by telling the stories of people who've been there before . Findi ng the stories of women pioneers and under -represented minorities who were pioneers used to be difficult. It's nice to be in New York for me . I get to go visit Judy Chicago's dinner table at the Brooklyn M useum, and I think about how hard it was for her to reclaim all of those women's names and how much easier it is to do it today . My Twitter feed just recently brought me the name of Sharla Boheim who actually was the original lead name on pocket -- packet simulation technology . You don't need to know what it is, but it's the foundation of the internet. And she was involved . Until quite recently, people didn't know that. So is using smart technology to tell our stories and tell them widely and bring more people into the conversation making us dumb? I certainly hope not, because it's something I participate in regularly . And almost last but by no means least, let's tackle the notion of community and citizenship. Andrew brought it up. Let's take it on a little bit more seriously . What have we used smart technology for from the last 18 months to think about notions of citizenship beyond the United States and within it? Were the students who were protesting at Mong Kok in Hong Kong say that smart technology was making them dumb? I don't think so . Would -- and I'm never going to get this man's name right, so I apologize in advance -- but would Feidin Santana think that he was doing something dumb when he took out his camera phone and recorded a policeman shooting someone in South Carolina? And we watched the video rocket around America and drive yet a further conversation about race and violence , an d what it means to be a citizen? We can dismiss hashtag activism -- such a great phrase -- as being a sort of a fleeting thing, right ? Whether it's #blacklivesmatter, #notallmen, #SOSblack Australia from my hometown . But truthfully the use of technology to propel conversations about citizenship is hardly new . A photograph made a huge difference in how we talked about the Vietnam War . The radio and vinyl records, whichIntelligence Squared: 19 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb are making a comeback, I'll have you know, helped distribute the word of Martin Luther King . And the suffragettes really liked a good typewriter. So is smart technology in those cases making us dumb? I don't think so . Does it mean we still have a lot of work to do as citizens? Absolutely . And lest I end on a depressing note, because I realize being told you have more work is depressing, let me just reflect briefly on something else . Smart technology is also in our everyday lives . And some of those things we may not think about as making us smart, but they're certainly chang ing, I would argue, for the better personhood . Here's my last example: Online dating, because you should end on a good note . When I was in India doing fieldwork many years ago, a place that had been embracing this technology for a long time, a woman said to me, ""Getting a husband is just a database problem."" And she said the matrimonial time -- matrimonial classified section of the Times of India c hanged everything for us because the database got bigger . So, let us imagine, from changing ideas of citizenship and safety, to ideas of romance to ideas of what it means to be in the world, it's really hard, I imagine, for any of us to sit in this room and to agree to the proposition that smart technology is making us dumb . So along with David, I think you should emphatically vote against it. Thank you. 19:27: 56",1.0

And perhaps most troubling of all -- Nick pointed to this -- was while we're all drowning in data, most of it extremely irrelevant at best -- inane, vulgar -- a tiny handful of Silicon Valley companies, most notably Google and Facebook, are making fortunes out of that data, not because it's correct, not because it has any value to civilization, not because it's solving problems in Africa, but because they're selling advertising around it .Intelligence Squared: 23 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb So there is a double vulgarity here, and I would much rather talk about a big data economy than an information economy.",2.0

It doesn't always feel that way, but a lot of this technology has been in mainstream adoption in the United States for less than a decade . 1 And I think, you know, one of the things that's very clear is that the first studies that were done about the impact of the Internet on our sociality, on our personalities, have long since been eclipsed by -- I'm thinking about t hat Sara Kiesler did at CMU, some of the other pieces of work, where some of the earlier assessments we made about how technology would affect people have now been proven, when you have more data, to be very different.

against,"Yeah . I mean, I think --Intelligence Squared: 37 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s -- there are a couple of things that run through that, right? Is we have a persistent anxiety about the impact of new technologies on our children. This one has a particular kind of visceral- ness to it . I'm willing to bet many of your parents worried about the impact of radio, rock and roll, television on all of us . The jury is in some ways still out on rock and roll, obviously, but not the rest. And there's something about why it is that we worry about technology and children in partic ular. And I think, you know, there are reasons to suggest -- and Nick's right on this -- that a diversity of experiences is a good thing . The challenge, however, here, is also beyond the kind of notion that every child is born with a smart device in one hand, and only a thumb in the other . The reality is that in lots of places in the world, kids are not using new technology . In lots of places in the world, there are cultures about how technology is introduced into children that suggests that, you know, you may be disadvantaged because there are other places -- if that's your fear -- that this is not happening . But I think it's a hard one to argue, right, is to say, ""Is, you know, technology pernicious and bad for children?"" Well, it's an argument that's been rehearsed for nearly 200 years . And I think all of you are living proof in the room that rock and roll didn't rot your brains. Well, you know -- -- fair point . We could always go look for some countries that didn't have it and see what the comparative state is.",2.0
for,"No . I don't. I mean, I think deep thinking is deep thinking, whether you apply it to a poem or to a scientific problem. I do think -- I mean, and that's not to say there aren't good things about being able to exchange information very quickly . I think science advances a lot -- in many cases, by being able to exchange information quickly . So that's a good thing about the Internet. But you come back to the point that we are having more and more trouble screening out distractions and interruptions, and really thinking deeply about something , which means concentrating our focus and concentrating our mind. And that's every bit as important to scientific discovery as it is to the humanities, right? And I think it's important to add that both science -- -- and the humanities are victims of this technology . So, supporters of the smart technology often point to Wikipedia and say, ""Well, Wikipedia is the example of how smart technology works .” But all the research on Wikipedia in dicates that the content there isn't very reliable . So, for example, when it comes to the medical information on Wikipedia, a board of doctors who researched this found that nine out of 10 articles on Wikipedia about medical were inaccurate, which is obviously particularly troubling . So, I think we have to be careful to believe that somehow, smart technology generates reliable, scientific information, but not information about the humanities . I think it's --",2.0
against,"So, if I understand your question correctly, if we look into the sciences, we see that smart technology has enabled a rapid advance of those sciences . What we're doing now would be absolutely impossible without the Internet. And not simply because of the rapid communication . It's really important -- but also because it has enabled -- things have grown up that enabled sophisticated collaboration. Management of gigantic multinational projects . It's enabled a type of iterative knowledge as well, in which ideas are put forward, and then iterated on in public . And this is actually a pretty new form of knowledge . It can be done at scale . The Internet is enabling open access, which is the movement that -- the idea that scientific research and research in the humanities, academic research should be available for free to anybody online . This is peer -reviewed, but not put it into academic journals that can ch arge 20 or $25,000 for a subscription, which is driving our libraries into great despair. And so, this ecosystem that Nick refers to , which I think is the right word, is in fact one that is extremely -- is enabling science to proceed , and research in gene ral can proceed at tremendous pace and enabling it to get deeper and deeper and more and more complex . I just don't know the people, Nick, who don't think deeply, who don't have a moment to think, who are distracted by their thumbs, that they don't -- who ? I don't meet them . I see so much more deep thinking out in the world than I -- So two .",2.0
for,"I think there's no question that if you need to get an answer to a well -defined question, that there's nothing so good as Google or Tweeting it out there or whatever . And again, that's one of the good things about the technology . But deep thought in the -- and I'm back to this again . Deep intelligence isn't about getting precise answers to well- defined questions. It's being able to know , what are the big questions you should ask ? How do you fit this informa tion together to form conceptual knowledge, to get big -picture knowledge? And if you spend all your time Googling and grabbing information, you might think you're smart . In fact, there was a very interesting study that came out just a couple of months ag o that -- that showed that people tend to think they're smarter because they're Googling all the time, and they confuse what's on Google with what's in their own brains . And as one of the researchers said, we have this weird -- we're in this weird time wh ere we seem to be getting dumber, but we are thinking that we're smarter . And that's kind of the illusion that this -- being wrapped in this information often provides . But, you know, we have to make that distinction between getting quick answers from Wi kipedia maybe, or from Google or whatever, and being smarter. And I don't think they're the same thing.",2.0
against,"So, listen, I mean, Nick, I think it's interesting, right . You’ll concede to the notion that a well -fo rmed question is an appropriate way to engage with a piece of technology . I'd sort of suggest that being able to form a well -formed question is an act of intelligence, right, being able to work out what the information is you want to extrac t and find the app that does it suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness . I mean, I think it's coming back to this for me, right, is how are you framing ""dumb"" and it's opposition and what that means, right. If you're a new mom trying to work out, is this not sleeping thing a good thing or a bad thing, and when do a worry? Those are questions that technology may be able to save you quicker than calling your own parent because she's in a different country . Is that about making you more dumb ? I don't think so. So there's something for me again about how we are framing the notion of dumbness and its opposition that I keep coming back to, right.",2.0

And the interviewer said, ""So I assume that as the -- as Google search engine has gotten smarter, people's questions have also gotten smarter.” And he said -- he laughed and said, ""No , it's exactly the opposite . People get lazier and lazier.” And this shows how we become dependent on the technology to do our thinking for us . And as a result, we get lazy, we fall victim to what scientists call automation complacency. You just simply think, let the machine do it for us . So even the formation of questions, we seem to be getting worse and worse as the searching gets better and better.",2.0

It wasn't about good question forming, it was about being -- it was Google knowledge, you know, knowing how Google worke d. But I think that your comments about people Googling and they think that they're smart is that you're actually, I think, repeating Socrates' mistake which is, you know, really good company to be in . But in the P haedrus I'm sure yo u know this is in the Phaedrus Socrates makes a terrible mistake, doesn't make a lot -- a terrible mistake . He's wondering about the smart tech of his time, which was writing things down . It was literacy. And he said, ""This is terrible because our memory will fail. We'll get much worse at remembering things .” And he was absolutely right about that, because if anybody here would like to stand up and recite ""The Illiad"" by heart, please do so and show me wrong . But generally, our memory has gotten much smaller than it -- than it was . So he was right about that, but he was wrong about the effect of literacy .",2.0

Nick was jus t saying that while the problems with Google or our search -centric culture is people are increasingly lazy . And what they're really lazy about is asking questions . What we're having is the automation of the act of asking a question. And that is one of the consequences or casualties of this digital revolution . And, of course, Socrates' greatest -- one of his greatest contributions to our culture was in the art of asking the question. That was the whole point of his philosophy, was it was about asking questions . That's what knowledge was, asking questions . And as Nick has made it clear, we have forgotten, or we are forgetting how to ask questions, and that's extremely troubling.",2.0

And his argument in the ""Republic"" was that we were mostly looking at shadows in his cave . And going from Socrates and Plato back to David, let me quote him .

And he says that's empowering . But look at our world . We're not empowered . It is, of course, the classic manifestation, perhaps in digital terms, of Plato or Socrates's cave, where we think we're empowered .

A ctually, if you look at airline safety research, and if you look at the recent proclamations from the FAA, they're saying that over automation is actually making pilots less capable .

And I want to make us think for just a moment here about what is that seduction? What is the anxiety that is appealed to when you applaud the notion that this technology is making us dumb? Because at beginning of this debate, most of you raised your hands that you had smart technology in your lives . Those of you who don't own it know people who do and live in worlds that are augmented by it . When you ask if anyone in the room was willing to admit to feeling dumber about it, there were o nly two of you who actually raised your hand . That makes me suspect that the number of you in the room who feel it, it's why you applaud, but you wouldn't say you did feel dumber because of it . My suspicion is that threading through all of that is a very human set of preoccupations and anxieties, an anxiety about what technology means for us, what it means for our humanity, our bodies, our competency, what it means to have new technologies in some ways threaten some of those things . But the reality is also, despite Nick's, in some ways, admiral notion that we should just use it less, that there is more and more technology in our lives, technology that we rely on, technology that some of us love, technology that many of us find valuable and us eful and instructive, that helps shape our exercise, our financial future s, that we use for banking and travel and leisure activities .
