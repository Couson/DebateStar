for," Well, this was at the urging of my wife, to give Deepak's world view a first-world try. And I have to say, I did feel much better after the weekend of meditating. Of course, it doesn't hurt to be in Carlsbad, California at the beach of a five-star resort, getting massages, and drinking tea, and doing yoga every day. If you're not feeling better, you're doing something wrong. Well, Dr. Heather Berlin is the perfect debate partner for me tonight because she studies consciousness from a neuroscience perspective. And of course, Deepak's whole interest is in consciousness, and they have very radically different views. So, I thought it'd be good to have somebody who not only studies this professionally from a purely -- a neuroscience perspective, but also does some clinical work. Thanks for having me. Yeah, no. That's true. I was 5 years old when I first came to the realization that I was going to die, which kind of freaked me out a bit. So, I asked my dad, ""Where -- dad, you know, where do my thoughts come from and can I keep them when I die?"" And he said, ""They come from your brain."" And I said, ""Okay.  And he said, ""Actually, we don't know."" And I said, ""Well, what can I be when I grow up to figure that out?"" And he said, ""Well, I guess, a psychiatrist?"" And so, that sort of -- from that moment on, it became my mission to try to understand where my thoughts come from, how my brain produces my consciousness, with the ultimate idea that perhaps I can keep my thoughts when I die. I still haven't found the answer for that, but it's been a quest my entire life. Maybe tonight. Maybe tonight.",nan

for," So, I'm going to argue in support of the motion from several different angles. But first I'm going to put my cards on the table and say that I am not an atheist. I was raised Jewish, culturally more than religiously, but I still remain open to the possibility that there's some higher creative power in the universe, some benevolence that I can't quite comprehend that might deserve the name God. But remember, we're not here to debate whether God exists. We're here to debate whether God is becoming less needed as humanity evolves. And however, we measure that need -- whether it's a need for explanations, a need for comfort, or a feeling of belonging, or just to give us a higher sense of meaning or purpose, the answer is clear. The more we evolve, the less we need God. Now, I'm going to go through these various forms of need one by one. But first, we should be clear what we mean by ""evolve."" We're not talking about biological evolution or changes in gene frequency. We're talking about cultural evolution, or just the development of humanity. And scientific progress over the past several hundred years has completely transformed our knowledge of how the world works. And each major scientific breakthrough has had to overturn some religious dogma, right? So, we've gone from believing in special creation to an understanding of how all living things descend from a single common ancestor by blind trial and error process -- natural selection. We've gone from believing that God placed the earth in the center of creation to an understanding that we inhabit a tiny blue dot in a vast cosmos with 100 billion galaxies. We've gone from believing that diseases were curses caused by evil spirits and bad karma to an understanding of the deep mechanisms of disease at the cellular and molecular level. But we still live in a world where people reject life-saving medicine on religious grounds. Just the other day, there was a news story about a 2-year-old boy who died because his parents chose prayer over medical treatment. So, the more our understanding evolves, the less we need God. Now, using God to explain natural phenomenon is an argument known as ""God of the Gaps."" Throughout history, if there was a gap in our understanding, it was by default to say God must explain it. But the more science illuminates our world, and gives us a real understanding, the fewer gaps are left for God to inhibit -- inhabit. So, when you hear from our opponents, be vigilant. They might tell you that the materialistic science can only explain so much. But we still need God beyond the limits of our understanding. That's a God of the Gaps argument. Just because science can't explain something yet, it doesn't logically follow that God wins by default. And if God is just another name for scientific ignorance, that's hardly a god worth celebrating. Now, my own field, neuroscience -- 350 years ago, Rene Descartes had argued that our perceptions had to be accurate because God would never deceive us. And our brains were made of physical mechanisms, but our conscious minds are an immaterial essence, a spirit that interacts with the physical brain through the pineal gland. But today, neuroscience is revealing that Descartes was wrong. Our perceptions are biased and inaccurate, which may explain the persistence of supernatural beliefs. And consciousness doesn't interact with the brain. Consciousness is what the brain does. And there's no reason to believe that consciousness existed before brains existed. Now, some people think they've experienced God directly, with or without drugs. But -- -- neuroscientists can now induce religious or transcendental experiences by stimulating specific brain areas with powerful magnets, giving people out of body experiences and sensation with oneness with the universe, not to mention hallucinations that would rival the Book of Revelations. So, the more our understanding of the brain evolves, the less we need God. And evolutionary and cognitive psychology are also helping to explain the origins of our need for God, for comfort, morality, sense of belonging, and why that need is diminishing. Religions traditionally provided a space for communal activities, a sense of trust among in-group members, and a disincentive to free-riders. So, belief in God has done a lot of good throughout history. But our modern societies now provide laws and social safety nets to help us when we fall, and to disincentivize bad behavior. And our social reputations are online now. I mean, when it comes to people like Harvey Weinstein, I'd say that public shaming, social rejection, and criminal charges carry a lot more weight than the fear of hell. I mean, after all, he didn't hire priests for redemption; he hired lawyers and publicists. And the very existence of countries like Denmark and Sweden -- majority atheist countries that are high-functioning and relatively free from suffering -- tells us that living without God is fully compatible with human psychology, as long as the need make sense of the world is satisfied by science and our need to belong is satisfied by our social networks and communities. So, the more our societies evolve, the less we need God. Of course, for many people, life is not as comfortable as it is for those Scandinavians, and God is a source of comfort for those who are suffering, or who have lost loved ones, or who are stricken by poverty or disease, and I get that. But if we're determined to work together to alleviate poverty, disease, and suffering, and make people happier in this world. And if we're aware of the fact that people tend, on average, to turn to God less often when they feel safer, happier, healthier, and more stable, then we have to admit that the motion is correct: The More We Evolve, The Less We Need God. ",nan
against,"  So, I of course request you to vote against the motion. When I use the word ""God"" -- or all of us who are in practices like meditation, self-reflection, awareness of body, awareness of mind, awareness of mental space, awareness of the web of relationship -- when we speak or practice yoga -- when we speak of God, we are not talking about an imagined deity. We're talking about the consciousness in which all experience occurs. And we're defining consciousness in very precise ways. So, one way to think of consciousness is that which makes any experience possible -- the experience of sensations, images, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, the experience of your body, the experience of your mind, this experience. So, consciousness is that in which all experience occurs. Consciousness is that in which all experience is known. And consciousness is that out of which all experience is made. All experience is made out of consciousness. In the wisdom traditions that I come from, therefore, consciousness is the imaginable potential for every mode of knowing and experience in all living beings. So, right now, we are having a human experience. This is a human experience. This is not the experience of a crocodile, or an insect with multiple eyes, or a snake that knows only infrared, or a bat that moves or navigates through the echo of ultrasound. This is a human experience in human consciousness. But consciousness is more than human consciousness. Consciousness is the basis of experience in every sentient being, in every living species. What their subjective experience is unknown to us, subjectively probably unknowable. So, consciousness -- or God -- is all knowers, all modes of knowing, and all experiences known. Consciousness is invisible.  Because it has no form. But without consciousness, there is no experience of that which we call visible. Consciousness is beyond perception. Why again? Because it's formless. It's boundless. It has no boundaries. It has no material structure to it. So, it's inconceivable. And yet, without it, there's no possibility of any concept. You cannot imagine consciousness. You can't imagine God, because if you imagine God, then it's not God. The infinite cannot be imagined. But without consciousness, there is no imagination. So, my dear friends, in every act of perception, right now, as you see, as you hear, as you sense your body -- in every act of perception, consciousness as God is creating the experience of the universe for you right this moment. Right this moment. Consciousness and God -- similar; I'm using the words synonymously -- consciousness is the only invariant in every changing experience. If you think you are your body, then you have to question that, because your body is not a noun. It's a verb. It's been changing since the time you were a zygote, an embryo, a baby, a toddler, and who you are right now. So, in every act of perception -- including that of your body, including that and every act of cognition, including the experience of your mind, God is creating the experience of the universe through you. When we transcend to this level -- which is the source of through contemplative practices, through yoga -- when we transcend to this level of existence, then automatically, automatically -- because we feel the unity of existence, the inseparability of existence, automatically there's the emergence of platonic values, like truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, love, compassion, joy, equanimity. There is also the loss of the fear of death, because consciousness being formless, it's not subject to birth and death -- exactly what you said. Birth and death are opposite, but life is the continuum of birth and death. So, by knowing ourselves as consciousness, we get to the source of all experience in every species that we call God. Right now, in this awareness we are having this particular experience. If consciousness is God, then we need consciousness to evolve.  Because, as Heather said, right now we're not talking about biological evolution. We are talking about what I would call metabiological evolution -- the evolution of our consciousness and ultimately the evolution of the consciousness of our consciousness. Because the key to consciousness, is self-awareness. God is our highest instinct to know ourselves. ",1.0
for,"  Thank you so much. The resolution, that The More We Evolve, The Less We Need God, I think is supported overwhelmingly by evidence from three lines of inquiry: evolutionary theory, history, and the social sciences. Now -- so first, John mentioned a synonym for ""need"" or -- necessary; God is necessary. Necessary for what? I contend that our starting point is the survival and flourishing of sentient beings -- that's us and other animals -- and the central problem with group living -- we're a social primate species -- the central problem with group living is trying to figure out how to get selfish genes that build these survival machines that just want to have -- maximize their own utility or benefits to cooperate with other survival machines built by selfish genes. And the problem is -- is figuring out how we tilt the incentives or create a choice architecture to get people to be nudged toward increasing or attenuating -- I'm sorry -- extenuating their better angels and squashing down or lowering our inner demons. So, it's this constant conflict between our inner demons and our better angels. And so, when we began to coalesce from these tiny bands and tribes of hunter gatherers into these giant chieftains and states around 10,000 years ago, this was the central tension: how do we do this? So, the two tools or technologies that evolved to do this were God and government. So, government basically gives everybody a copy of the rules and says, ""These are the dos and don'ts, and here's the penalties if you violate them."" Of course, there's not sophisticated police systems at the time. So, people got away with it. But you don't really get away with it, because there's an eye in the sky that sees and knows all that you're doing and can impose punishments in the next life. So, this is God or religion. So, for thousands of years, it was kind of a toss-up between anarchy of having no state or government organization, and tyranny -- having either oppressive governments or religions oppressing their people. And -- but something -- history -- then evolved about four centuries ago. The Scientific Revolution discovered that the universe is knowable and that it's governed by natural laws that we can discover and understand, beginning with the physical sciences -- Galileo and Newton -- into the biological sciences and medicine, all the way to the social sciences. And so, in the Enlightenment, there developed a number of theories about how best we should live with one another. So, there was essentially to create -- to find the Newton of the social sciences. How best should we live? And that led to pretty much most of the moral progress we've made over the last several centuries. That is to say -- the abolition of slavery, and torture, the death penalty, the death increase in civil liberties and civil rights, the expansion of the moral sphere, the bending of the moral arc, if you will, toward greater justice for more people in more places, more of the time, I argue, has primarily been the result of science, and reason, and these Enlightenment values like natural rights -- not the function of religion or belief in God. In fact, I would argue that with a few exceptions, that almost all the progress has been the result of secular forces -- that is justifying why you're making certain social changes or passing laws based on reasons, good reasons, and evidence, rather than appealing to a higher supernatural power. The problem with religion is that the creator of the universe has set down many different rules of how we should live together. And there's no means to determine which is the right one. There's nothing in religion -- there's no methodology in religion comparable to science, in which we say, ""We're going to -- let's run an experiment and see which one is the best, which one most closely matches reality."" And I'm not just talking about physics and biology; I'm talking about social sciences. We have 50 different states with 50 different state constitutions and 50 different sets of laws -- say, gun control laws, or tax laws. You can study those and determine which is the best set of methods we should use. Religion has nothing like that. The problem with religion is that it's more of a sort of group cohesiveness method that drives people to be more tribal and xenophobic. And then, finally, in my third line of inquiry on the social sciences, I'll cite just one study -- among many -- by Gregory Paul of -- correlating the differences between rates of religiosity, belief in God, Biblical literalism, belief in the afterlife, and heaven and hell -- in 20 different leading democracies in the Western world. As a function of their societal health, societal health is measured by rate of homicide, suicides, STDs, abortions, teen births, marriage, divorce, alcohol consumption, life satisfaction, corruption indices -- adjusted per capita income, income inequality, poverty, employment levels, incarceration, life expectancy and so on. Well, you can't believe this, but it turns out that the higher the rates of religiosity in a nation, the more people believe in God in a nation, the worst they score on these indices of societal health. And America stands out by far, with no one even a close second, as the most religious of the Western democracies and the worst on all of these. We have the highest homicide rates, suicide rates, teen STD rates, pregnancy rates, and so on. Income inequality, and alcohol consumption, life satisfaction, employment levels, and on, and on, and on. Now, I'm not saying that those things have -- are caused by religion. But if religion and belief in God is such a great force for driving moral progress, how come it fails so abysmally here and every other nation where religiosity and belief in God is high? Therefore, I urge you to vote for our side, that The More We Evolve, The Less We Need God. ",1.0
against,"What if this world we're experiencing is a mental experience and not primarily physical? What if what we call the mind isn't just in here, but it's all this? And what if you and I are experiences in this vast mind? What I'd like to do is challenge the story we've all been taught since we were kids. I'd like to challenge the notion of what we are, what all of us are, and what this world is, what it's made of. Max Plank , a Nobel Prize winning physicist, said, ""I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness.""  And what he's saying is something all of us experience when we dream -- that the universe is entirely mental. Now, I'm not saying that this is a dream. What I'm saying is that whatever this is made of, whatever this is made of, it's the same stuff that a dream is made of -- namely, consciousness. And when we look at it through different frames of mind, we perceive it differently -- as mental, or physical, or however we may describe it: information, energy -- you've heard all of these descriptions. Consciousness is primary. And what we call matter is an experience in our consciousness. So, this hand feels really firm and solid, and physical. I would describe it as physical -- and if this were a dream, it would still feel firm, and solid, and I would still call it physical. And yet, we know that it would be made entirely out of consciousness. Now, if consciousness is primary, it's also infinite, simply because all experiences would be in consciousness. So, the space that appears to separate us right now is an experience. It's a projection. In a dream, I can take a space shuttle from Cape Canaveral all the way to the moon, and come back home, and I would cover half a million miles of vast space. And yet, with the shift in consciousness -- that's what we call waking up in the morning, a shift in consciousness -- with that shift, the very same space is re-conceived as a projection. I submit to you the same is happening right now. Nobody has ever perceived anything outside of consciousness. That means every experience, including space and time, is in consciousness. So, history, philosophy, music, art, literature, you name it, it's in consciousness. With that context, let's attend to the motion specifically. Not only is consciousness infinite, but the infinite has always been the ultimate description of what we call God. The more common notions, the more familiar notions, and all the notions that were spoken about by the opposing team, they are aspects of God. So, there's infinity, but then we talk about infinite wisdom, infinite compassion, infinite mercy, infinite understanding. These are aspects of infinity. And this infinity shows up, not only in religion, but it shows up in mathematics, and philosophy as different aspects, different approaches. So, the ultimate god of religion -- not the different forms of God; it's not the particular names of gods -- which are the varieties we see that depend on the human mind that conceives them, but the ultimate God, the infinity, that shows up in mathematics as infinity. It shows up in philosophy as truth. It shows up in science as the reality behind science. It shows up in all experience, in every experience, as consciousness. Each of these is a unique perspective. And therefore, each has unique data to contribute about something that's beyond all concepts. The more we evolve, the more we see the infinite underlying nature of all things. Call it religious, call it spiritual, call it secular, or simply the practical experience of knowing ourselves and each other more deeply. So, let me ask you -- do we need to understand ourselves more deeply? Do we need to understand each other a little better? And do we need to understand this crazy, inexplicable world better? If your answer is yes, then I urge you to vote against the motion, because the more we evolve, the more we need to understand the infinite. So, my friend Michael, whom I refer to as Angel Michael -- -- the apostle for scientism -- cites science --",1.0

Theories are conceived in consciousness. Observations are made in consciousness. You can't do science without consciousness. Even the -- trying to understand consciousness is in consciousness, as Max Plank said. You can't get behind consciousness. To create artificial intelligence, augmented reality -- you name it -- to understand the microbiome, to understand your own biology -- you need consciousness. To do science, to create technologies, to do philosophy -- all systems of thought, all systems of thought, whether they're religion, or philosophy, or science, or theology, require consciousness. So, consciousness gives rise to systems of thought which then give us a certain interpretation of reality. That reality is impossible without consciousness.",1.0
for," So, I mean, the way we experience the world that we find ourselves in is via first-person subjective experience, which we'll call consciousness, right? That's how -- yes -- we come up with the laws of science. And it's subjective, right? Only I know my own consciousness. I don't know anybody else's. We know that we can knock it out in patients. lesions from parts of the brain, they can experience nothing. When you're in a deep dreamless sleep, you're not experiencing anything. And we can map out -- we can make correlation between consciousness and the brain. However -- and this is something, since I was 5, I've wanted there to be consciousness outside of the brain. I've been looking for it. I've been trying to find any bit of evidence for it, okay? And you can't trust your own experience because it's subjective, right? The way that we can understand reality in the most objective way that we have discovered is through the scientific method. But -- so what I'm really curious, and I can't get my mind around, is where they're coming up with there proclamations of knowing that consciousness exists outside of the material world, and then calling that God. I mean, to me, it seems a bit just like a fairytale. I can say -- I can also make a proclamation about consciousness and what it is. But without any evidence, I don't understand how they're coming to these conclusions.",1.0

I am here."" That's consciousness, right? Before I create a theory, a conceptual theory -- that no, actually the brain produces consciousness; that's theoretical. But the first thing I know is I am here or I am alive. Consciousness is the first thing we know, and everything else is secondary to that. When we say that the brain produces consciousness, we're already implying dualism, because we're saying as if there's something physical first, and then in that, we're experiencing something that's mental -- whereas, in fact, even the experience of physicality is already mental. In other words, the mind is the primary organ of experience, and the brain is a representation of the mind. To know that, you don't have to go any further than your own experience. I am exist. I am here. I am consciousness.  And now I experience a brain. The brain is an experience in consciousness. To even say that the brain comes first still requires consciousness first, whether you say it or not.",1.0

against,"Well -- so -- So, what I'm saying is that there are many different definitions of God. So, if you look at the different religions, everybody will have a different name, or a different idol, or a different concept.

So, I'm -- we're defining as that to begin with, as God is that ultimate, which -- toward which we're always evolving by the mind becoming more and more subtle, and thereby going beyond our progressive boundaries. Science is, as I said, is an activity in conscious. What Heather calls the objective world is an intersubjective experience in human consciousness. Before I can call this an object, it's a shape. It's a color. It's a form -- as an experience. When I call it an object, I reify that experience in consciousness and create a human construct that this is a glass and this is water. That's the interpretation of experience. Before you can name something as an object, you first have to experience it. So, you know, Descartes said, ""I think, I am."" He was wrong. ""I am, therefore I think."" ""I am, therefore I perceive."" And when I say ""perceive,"" I mean also perceive this -- this body, those bodies, and all these bodies. So, before you can name an object, it has to be an experience -- a subjective experience. That's the necessity. And without having the experience, how can you call anything an object?",1.0

for,"After my experiences at Deepak Center, and there was no illegal drugs -- or even legal drugs involved -- so, I've wrote a chapter in my latest book about Deepak. And so, I made a distinction there between the weak consciousness principle and the strong consciousness principle. So, the weak consciousness principle is that in order to experience consciousness, you have to be conscious. In order to experience something, you have to be alive and experiencing. And it's something that's, well -- it's what calls a deepity . It's like, it sounds deep until you think about it for a second. You go, ""Well, yeah, obviously."" You know, it's like imagining -- imagine being dead. You can't do it, because to imagine something, you have to be alive, okay? So -- the -- but what they're arguing is something stronger than that, the strong consciousness principle -- that consciousness brings about -- if I understand you correctly, Deepak -- brings about the physical instantiation of our brains and bodies, that the consciousness is primary -- it's already there. And we're just a temporary hold or instantiation of consciousness in the physical body. Well -- I mean, we -- to get the ultimate answer, ""Which worldview is correct,"" we need to have some way to test it, to experiment with it. How do we know? I mean, if you just say, ""It was my internal experience and your internal experience, and we'll never get anywhere,"" then it's a late-night conversation that's fun, but that's it. Can we do better than that? And yes; we know from neuroscience, for example, that you can -- as Heather mentioned -- knock out parts of the brain. And the function, the mind, the consciousness, whatever word you want to use -- that was doing whatever it was doing there -- is gone. And it's gone forever.

What I am saying is that as our minds become more subtle, we become more fine-tuned in differentiating what is right? After all, do we really know what's right and wrong. And if so, why isn't it manifesting in the world today? Well, the answer to that is because it depends on each of our minds. So, as the mind becomes more subtle, as it becomes more perceptive, then our very notions of right and wrong become more refined.

But that doesn't mean that that world is not made of consciousness. It's an impersonal consciousness. And the separation between that personal consciousness -- of the character in the dream -- and the rest of the dream -- like, for example, this hall -- is in the mind. That's the difference.

That is bad. And any time you believe in something like that, no matter what field it's in, that's going to lead to problems. So, I think any overthrowing of that version of what God is, is good.

We don't even need a sense of self for it, okay? So, that's what we're talking about when we we're talking about pure subjective experience. And we all have it. The question is, how can we get more of it? We experience the world via consciousness.  That's how we humans experience the world. So, how do we get more of it? We can have different aspects of it. We can see it in a different way. We can have a deeper understanding. All that is great. But that doesn't mean it exists outside of us. And I can even give you that consciousness may be fundamental. It's a property of the universe. We have theories in consciousness -- the integrated information theory of consciousness, that says any system that has a high degree of integrated information that's differentiated -- integrated meaning it has an effect on each other -- will have a property of consciousness. Yet, it is still instantiated in matter. That means brains happen to be one of those systems.

I mean, we -- you know, as Vicinstein pointed out, we just -- you know, we have -- we only have language to express our words -- our thoughts between each other. So, we look for synonyms. You know, consciousness is experience. It's the immeasurable potential. It's invisible. It's all modes of knowing. These are just different ways of saying the same thing. And it -- so, it doesn't really get us anywhere. There's no specific actionable points. Like, what do I do? So, the motion on the table is, you know, what difference does it make? What does it matter? And so, we have to have some definition. That was why I started off with the, you know, survival and flourishing of sentient beings. So, what does it take to do that? And now we have some idea about that. Now if -- now, I should say, just parenthetically, that I kind of went hard on religion. I know that the Quakers and Wilberforce advocated for the abolition of slavery and so on. There are, you know, certain individuals that help the process along. But their biggest opponents were their fellow religious people, their fellow God-believers. So, it's not God itself that's going to get us there. It's some rational argument, some secular reasonable argument. So, the fact that Christians sometimes say, ""Well, I've reinterpreted Mark 3:9, and Jesus really meant women should vote"" -- okay, fine. But you're getting there after the movement has already made it progress due to secular rational arguments.  And I would say, you know, if we think -- if you want to re-define consciousness as saying all of these things -- compassion, and being kind to others, and doing things that are actually real in this world to help people -- again, you don't need the concept of God, or a higher spirit, or something that happened before the Big Bang in order to do those things, in order to live helpful, kind lives, to make everybody's lives better. So, in a sense, I don't think that the more we evolve, the more we need God in this definition as well, because we can find it in other ways. We can get better and improve humanity in other ways without having some either real or false belief system. Either way, we can be compassionate. We can have a deep understanding. We can think about the infinite. We could do the right thing, and we don't need God.",1.0

One thing that's hard about this conversation is that when we say what we're calling God is consciousness, it doesn't necessarily oppose anything they're saying, because science is a function in consciousness. Reason is a function as consciousness. I use science and technology all the time. I think science has done great things. That's not counter to my idea of consciousness. All I'm saying is, it's also more than that. It's not only what we call objective -- which, by the way, there's no such thing. All we mean by objective is less subjective; there are more people that agree on what the subjective is. So, I'm not opposed to anything they're saying. What I'm trying to do is reframe it so that we're not limited to only those ideas, but consciousness or God is much more than that and much more than that, and much more is possible than we already think is possible. So, one -- -- of the things -- -- that's a great question. One of the things we're assuming here is that consciousness is a product of life. And that's what I said earlier, in the beginning. I think I said birth and death are opposed to each other, but life is unopposed. And here, we could use consciousness, again, as a synonym for that. So, again, by consciousness, I'm not saying that consciousness came into existence when we as humans -- or even when any sentient being came into existence. Just like in a dream, all of the characters may die, but that doesn't mean that the dream itself has to die. So, similarly, the big bang is a human construct -- I'm not saying it didn't happen. What I'm saying is the way we perceive that big bang -- whatever factors were involved when that big bang started, we're seeing that through a human mind's lens. What is actually was, we don't know. We know how we derive it through the human mind and let that be. So, whatever that is is -- but what I'm saying, whatever it is, whatever concept we give to it, that is still a concept of consciousness -- not mine, not yours, not necessarily human.

The excitement of discovery, the story of how we humans have used reason and science to illuminate the universe around us, while improving the quality of life for billions of people. That story is far more inspiring than any story told in a religious text or here on this stage. At -- and that story has the benefit of evidence behind it. It has the benefit of perhaps being true, at least to the best of our knowledge. The fact is, people do find other sources of meaning and purpose when they lose their sense of religion, or even God. Atheists, as a group, are not wallowing in depression or existential angst, and they're no more likely to behave immorally than believers are. And we scientists are enthusiastic, engaged, and optimistic about the real-world benefits our work is generating. For instance, the U.N. Sustainability Goals -- none of which require a belief in God -- include ending hunger, and poverty, providing education, and clean water for everyone, protecting the environment, reducing inequality. If that's not a sense of purpose, I don't know what is. And insofar as competing visions of God or what God is, are still a motive for violence in the world, or for oppressing women, homosexuals, or non-believers -- then belief in God is currently holding us back. Now, many people still believe in God, and they need God in their lives, and that's okay. But that's not the motion you're being asked to vote on. The motion isn't does less of each of us needs God, the motion is the less we need God -- we, as a human species, all of us together. And I'm sympathetic to the comfort that belief in God can give people, and I wouldn't be arrogant to claim that everyone needs that comfort, especially when more and more people clearly do not. It's an empirical fact that we humans, on average, need God less than we used to for explanations, for community, and for comfort. And if you agree, or even if you think the modern world has diminished any of the needs that God has once filled, then logically, the motion is correct. We need God less.

Now, with the proviso that the super forecasters, after five years' predictions, fold at randomness . So -- this is the best I can do. I think what we've been experiencing over the last several centuries will continue. That is, the expansion of the moral sphere to include more sentient beings, more of our own species, as deserving of equal rights and equal treatment. When I wrote my book on this, ""The Moral Arc"" in 2015, the gay marriage thing hadn't yet been settled. That's done. We can tick that box. Next, I think, probably, will be animal rights, and then possibly, probably within a century or two, that of rights for AI -- for intelligent beings -- for data, so to speak. You know, beyond that, it's hard to say. I think the idea of consciousness, if we use it in the terms like our -- the civil rights activists did, consciousness raising -- what does that mean? We're expanding our consciousness to include the perspective of other people. What would it feel like if I was treated that way? So, to this extent, something like the Golden Rule, which was discovered long before any organized religions, it's a principle of reciprocal altruism and evolutionary theory. It makes perfect sense that I have to make my case for you to treat me that I would want -- for me to treat you the way I would want you to treat me. That's about as fundamental of human psychology as it gets. And I think that's what we've been getting better at over the centuries. And despite the little down-ticks we have occasionally, of negative things that make the news, the good news -- follow the trend lines, not the headlines -- continues to go in our own time and will continue for centuries to come. I think that the -- and the fastest growing religious group in the world are the nones, the people that have no religious affiliation. And atheism is growing, and so on. I think we don't need that. The tools -- the things that we call religion and belief in God are actually just certain tools.

You know, fundamentally, I don't know if we can. And maybe that's part of the debate, is to say that too. I think the way that we experience the world -- I think most of us would agree on this -- the way that we experience the world and ourselves is entirely dependent on our minds. And, we can say, brains. I don't have a problem with saying that too. The way we experience ourselves is dependent on our minds and our brains. So, if we're having fundamentally different experiences, how do we capture that? How do we come together on that? What I would say is that each of us has a sense of identity that is extremely fickle. When we dream, our identity shifts from this character to that character. When we sleep, our identity disappears. And what we're saying is that this identity can become more and more subtle. It can delocalize. And as it does, what we're calling the ultimate aspect of that -- the endpoint of that, perhaps -- is consciousness. That's what we're calling as God, and maybe we just differ on that, and that's okay. However, if you agree that the sense of identity is something that's constantly changing, that can become more subtle -- and ultimately, even theoretically, can be boundless, can be infinite -- then that is you.
