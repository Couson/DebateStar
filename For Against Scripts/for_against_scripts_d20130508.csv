for,"Thank you. To understand why FDA's caution is hazardous to our health, you have to appreciate FDA's growing focus on statistical outcomes over results for patients. Fading at FDA is a mindset of clinical medicine and patient care. And in it is a growing fixation on the statistical results, clinical trials, and a growing rule by math over medicine. This mindset can be seen in the triage that now hamper clinical trials and drug development. FDA imposes increasingly onerous experiments to try to ferret out benefits from new drugs. And FDA reviewers want the results of clinical trials to insulate them from critics; critics who say they're not doing enough about drug safety. But the laborious trials that result come at a very big, human cost. Higher degrees of statistical certainty under FDA's outdated way of designing drug trials require longer, larger, and increasingly impractical studies, especially when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs. Some promising therapies simply aren't being developed. Let me tell you one story of how this mindset impacts patients. Hunter's Syndrome is part of a family of related and extremely rare disorders. All are inherited. Each robs children of the ability to produce a crucial enzyme that's used by the body to break down certain sugar molecules found in the blood. Missing these enzymes, these molecules end up accumulating in places like the liver, and the spleen, and the joints, with often painful and debilitating consequences. Before treatment came along, parents had to literally sit idly by and watch as these diseases destroyed their children. But by the 1990s, drugs were developed that could function as replacements for the enzymes that were missing in these related disorders. These disorders were so bad and the drugs were so promising that the first of these medicines, a drug for Gaucher’s Disease called Ceredase, was approved on the basis of a very simple clinical trial that involved only a dozen patients. By 2004, FDA had approved enzyme replacements for four other conditions that were each very similar to Hunter's Syndrome. All were lysosomal storage diseases, where kids were born missing one of these crucial and related enzymes. It was understood that if you could replace the enzyme, these children were likely to derive a therapeutic benefit. But when an experimental enzyme for Hunter's Syndrome finally came along, a decade after that original drug was approved for Gaucher’s Disease, FDA's regulatory norms and FDA's regulatory culture had changed dramatically. In an effort to satisfy an increasingly demanding desire for statistical certainty, the FDA trial imposed extraordinary hardships on the children and their families. In order to approve the Hunter's drug, called Elaprase, FDA required that the trial enroll 96 patients. This was fully 20 percent of all the Americans afflicted with the disorder. And instead of testing the drug for six months, as had been done for every other drug, all of these enzyme replacements, FDA wanted a full year of clinical data, 52 weekly infusions in these kids. FDA also insisted that the kids be randomly assigned to receive either a drug or a placebo. There was no need to have a placebo in this clinical trial. The disease follows avery predictable pattern. And doctors already knew the normal decline these kids would have if they were left untreated. But leaving some kids untreated was basically leaving them to become disabled. Yet, including the placebo helped give the trial itself more statistical rigor for FDA. Finally, in past trials, with all these lysosomal storage drugs, these enzyme replacements, drugs targeted to similar diseases, FDA asked companies to measure surrogate markers that the -- the drug was having an impact on disease. Like the ability to shrink organs, like the liver and the spleen. That was interpreted as proof that the drug was breaking down the sugar molecules and they weren't becoming deposited there. And this would mean that the enzyme replacement was working. By looking at these surrogate measures, which you could measure over a shorter period of time, it was a way to accelerate the development of the drug. But in the case of the Hunter's drug, Elaprase, FDA decided to test the ability of the children to walk and to breathe as the clinical outcome it wanted. FDA saw this as a more rigorous way to see if the drug was working, but it came with hard trade-offs. It made the trial much longer than it needed to be. You had to wait years for the kids to become disabled to see if the drug was having its impact and to measure the result. And it tested the boundaries of what was ethical. Yet, this story is increasingly the norm when it comes to FDA review culture and it's played out multiple times in recent years, so much so that observers who follow the FDA now believe that the Europeans have become more flexible when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs than the Americans. The drug for bone cancer, the drug Pirfenidone for ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the drug Tafamidis for familial amyloidosis, all rejected by FDA in recent years because the statistical results didn't meet the agency's requirements, all approved in Europe, all embraced by European regulators. To understand why FDA's caution is, at times, hazardous, you have to recognize FDA's growing resolve to make sure the trials supporting drug approval meet an arduous but increasingly outdated standard for proving efficacy. As my debate partner, Peter Huber will show, this outdated model that FDA uses exacerbates these problems by making trials much more inefficient than they should be and allowing us to learn far less from the results than we otherwise can. Yet surveys of people with life-threatening disorders continue to show that patients want access to promising drugs sooner. They're willing to tolerate some risk. They're willing to tolerate the uncertainty. For patients with unmet medical needs, what kind of FDA do we want; an FDA that advances care, an FDA that gets new science to the patient more quickly? What we can't have is an FDA that's ruled by statistics over medicine. We can't have an FDA that focuses on its process rather than advancing patient care. Americans deserve a less cautious FDA and an FDA that actively embraces advances in science. Thank you.",nan
against,"Thank you very much. It is certainly the case that FDA, like any big organization, will occasionally not get things right. And I don't know the rare disease that Dr. Gottlieb mentioned, but I think we can all agree that in this very difficult balancing act of, “Is this drug going to help patients, is it going to perhaps make them sicker?” it is not an easy call. But I think the most important aspect of the question before us is, in general, do we want to have an FDA that is thinking very hard about risks and benefits and is requiring that the manufacturers who bring drugs to the FDA demonstrate that, in sum, the drug is going to be better for patients and not run the risk that we have all seen in recent years of a Vioxx or an Avandia that actually caused heart attacks and strokes because those problems were not detected. Now, there are a number of myths that underlie the proposition that I think it's important to just dismiss early on. One is that somehow FDA is the reason that we don't have more new drugs and that FDA is slower than other regulatory agencies. And in fact, these are questions that one can look at with real data. And the real data do not bear out the assertion that Dr. Gottlieb is defending. There is a very high acceptance rate by FDA of new drugs. In an article in Forbes from last December, it documented that 77 percent of drugs are approved the first time around, and a very high proportion of the ones where FDA says, “Please go back and find some more information out for us,” are then approved the second time around. In 2012, the FDA approved 39 new drugs, which was way higherthan it has approved in any number of years for the last 16. It was a 16-year high. So FDA is indeed saying yes to drugs, and it is doing so at a rapid clip. That's the other myth that we need to disabuse ourselves of. In fact, the salaries of the FDA staff that review drugs are, for better or worse, half paid by the drug industry, which creates with it some deadlines that, as a result of the so-called user fees, the FDA must have its deadlines met. And for a priority drug, which is an important new drug that brings something to the table that we don't already have, that is needed by patients, that deadline is six months. And in the last year, 33 out of the 35 drugs that were brought to FDA met their standard, whether it was six months for a priority review or ten months for a standard review. You need a lot of time to be able to look at all of the adverse effects that happen, what is the degree of benefit. And again, I'm sure that there are instances where it could have been done better. And there certainly are ways that, as was mentioned in the early presentation by Mr. Rosenkranz, where we would like to be bring in genetics and bring in new molecular theories to approve drugs. And that's great, and FDA is trying very hard to move in that direction. But in fact, FDA is saying yes most of the time. It is approving drugs quickly, as per its requirements. And in a paper last year in the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" by Dr. Ross and colleagues from Yale, reasonable university, reasonable journal, they look at whether or not the FDA was in fact slower than other regulatory agencies. And so they looked at the European medicines agency, which is the pan-European FDA equivalent, and Health Canada which is the Canadian version of FDA. And it found that, in fact, review times in the U.S. were shorter for FDA than they were for the Europeans and for the Canadians. And in fact for drugs that were approved in both places, 64 percent of the time they were approved first in the U.S. before in Europe, and 86 percent of the time, they were approved in the U.S. before Canada. So the myth that somehow FDA is slowing things down is not borne out by the facts. The reason we don't have as many new drugs as all of us on this stage and the audience would like to have is because the pharmaceutical industry is not bringing a lot of new drugs to FDA to approve. And they can't approve a drug that is not submitted to them. And yet they have this tension because they need to be able to have a drug brought to them, and yet they know, and we know, that manufacturers' enthusiasm, to put it as kindly as we can, about a product that they're trying to market, is perhaps not always going to catch all the down sides. And we've all seen examples of that. So there needs to be an agency that represents the best interests of the American public and can say to the manufacturer, “That does sound promising, but there are some things that you really need to look at, and if it's an important new drug, we'll get you an answer in six months.” I don't think that's too much to expect of a company to do,especially since we know that any drug that is powerful enough to make a difference in patients' lives is also powerful enough to do something that we don't want it to do and didn't expect it to do. And one cannot know that because of enthusiasm or because of medical need. There does need to be a cautious agency out there looking at drugs. And Dr. Challoner later will talk about devices, which is the other piece of FDA's responsibility besides food, which we're not going to get into. And we need to have something interposed between an enthusiastic company, which has billions of dollars riding on the success of its product, and the public health of the American people. And there needs to be a rigorous review. That rigorous review can be done quickly, it can -- and it is being done quickly. It is generally favorable. And just because we can make it better by informing it with genetic and other kinds of biological discoveries doesn't mean that we don't still need to have a traffic cop, kind of like an air traffic controller. We all saw a couple of weeks ago what happens when we have big government back away from having enough air traffic controllers. The FDA is the air traffic controller for our drugs, and that is why we need their caution. It is not the case that it's causing public health problems. In fact, they have gotten faster and faster over the past decade. And as a result, they are proving that they can help the American people be protected from drugs that have bad effects. And that's exactly what we need them to do. And that's why I think that it is important to vote against the proposition that FDA's caution is hazardous to our health. Thank you. Thank you, John, and members of the audience. I will be speaking, as was said, against the motion that the FDA's caution is hazardous to your health, in particular, as it relates to the device side of the equation. The FDA is a public health agency. It is responsible for the safety and efficacy of the devices that are used by you, on you, and put in you. If anything, the anecdotes of the last decade would indicate that we need more caution in our systems. The evidence -- I think this will reverberate with most of you. The Shiley heart valve, implanted in patients, many patients, begins after several years shattering and embolizing to your brain and to your peripheral body and killing some patients before they could be replaced.",1.0
for,"Right. Well, I think that the issue really is development times, not review times, as Dr. Avorn talked about. He was focusing on review times, how long does it take FDA to look at the applications? Really the issue is how long does it take to develop the drugs. On average, it takes about nine years to develop a drug for endocrine disorders, about six years to develop a drug for cancer. It has to go through typically three phases ofclinical trials. The first phase is looking for proof of activity; second phase is looking for -- Depending on the disease, you're either doing it in healthy volunteers or in sick patients in you have a drug targeted to a -- you know, a rare cancer or something that's fatal. You're going to put the drug in Phase I in patients who are already sick. But typically if it's a drug targeted at, let's say, hypertension, you're going to put it in healthy volunteers. And in Phase I, you're looking mostly at safety, although they're starting to look at issues of efficacy, and you're starting to look at issues of dose. Phase II, you're looking at proof of concept. You want to see if the drug works. You're not necessarily assessing the clinical outcomes in the clinical trial, but you're looking at indication that's the drug is having the activity that you anticipated. And that's more people. And depending on the disease you're looking at, it's anywhere from -- it could be a couple of hundred in a cancer trial to, you know, 5,000 in a primary care drug.",2.0

Under the accelerated approval rule, you cut off a big chunk of what the FDA's normal rules do. You actually cut off in the middle of Phase III or Phase II. Or -- and some people are pushing to cut off after Phase I, because the results are so dramatic there, okay? You are actually not doing what is normally required",2.0
against,And Peter's --,2.0
for,"As -- wait just as second. And who does it, then? Because you still have to finish. And the answer is, you do it -- by and large, you do it in Phase IV. And a lot of doctors out there are now also using the drug. And they are working completely independently and they are the ones who are using the modern tools to work out how to fit these rather simple drugs to our extremely complex bodies. They're finding the biomarkers on efficacy and safety. These are all emerging later. They are getting the precision medicine. And nowhere else in the FDA protocols you get that. It never emerges during the standardized conventional protocols. You are blinded all the way through. There is no Bayesian adaption during the trials. There's -- -- you just don't get the information, okay? I put in one word, Bayesian. That means that you're actually -- It means you're actually looking at the data as you go and learning from it as you go and adapting to it. And the FDA -- -- is so concerned about something called selection bias, they don't allow it all. I would just add to that the FDA has actually been backing away from the accelerated approval rule in recent years, so much that the Congress had to re-codify it and reach a legislation to say, “We really meant it. We want you to use this try to” -- It -- It is. The only place we are actually developing modern drugs -- -- are -- start at the molecular level.John Donvan: What about -- Nowhere else FDA.",2.0
against,"Well, I have trouble with that. Unless it's linked on the other end with post-market surveillance.

But an early warning system that will allow the immediate understanding of the various communities involved here to feed back, to get that drug or get that device -- -- off the market. That is -- well, if you're going to short circuit on the front end, sure -- I think --",2.0
for,"Look -- and I couldn't agree more, but let me tell you something. The whole notion that you convene a group of patients of a certain size, and you test them for a certain time, and then you make a declaration of a drug is a pure artifice of the kinds of the statistics that the FDA uses in its conventional protocols. It's the frequentest trial. If you -- forgive the jargon -- the alternative I've been discussing is typically called Bayesian trials. And those are completely open-ended. No serious Bayesian says we will stop after certain time and a certain number of patients. You keep feeding the data into the system forever and you keep refining forever. And you put it in massive computer -- the databases, which people are already doing. And that's the process. And you can have separate calls on when people convene and charging -- they're using the drugs, but that's how you do the side.",2.0
against,"It is my -- Actually, I think there's a lot to be said for Bayesian analyses. And I know that FDA is interested in learning more about it. But that's a little arcane-- Maybe to give a concrete example of how -- I mean, who could be against rapid assessment of drugs? And I can give you an example of why we can sometimes think that that's not a great idea.There was a drug approved at the very -- in the last couple of days of 2012 for tuberculosis. And the FDA approved it based on an accelerated review in which it looked at what we called a surrogate marker. That is, not “Did it make your tuberculosis better” but “Did it change some lab tests?” In this case, it was about how much TB bug was growing into your sputum. And that seems like a good idea, because the law requires that FDAs then have to follow that up with a real clinical trial, where you actually follow patients and ask did their TB get better, besides did their sputum get better. The problem that -- I have a longer article about it in the Journal of the American Medical Association a couple weeks ago. The problem is that the FDA sped through that, approved the drug because it made the sputum get more sterile of TB drugs a couple of weeks sooner than placebo did. The only problem was that there was a five-time greater rate of death rate in the people given this new drug than the people given placebo. And most of those deaths were from tuberculosis. What about the follow-up studies that the law requires the FDA to do? They told the company, “We want you to come back with a real clinical trial about this drug. And we want it on our desk by 2022.” I think that suggests -- -- that the FDA can sometimes go too far in that direction.",2.0
for,"There is no question that FDA should have authority after these drugs are approved through trials that try to accelerate the development to continue the studies and then collect information. But when we're dealing with unmet medical needs, life-threatening disorders, patient want access to these drugs sooner. And you talked just about review times. But the real issue here is development times. And they've been going up. And they've been going up because the trials that FDA's mandating on drug developers are more and more rigorous. They're larger and larger trials. You're talking about trials that used to be two or 3,000 patients -- now are 10- or 20,000 patients. John Donvan:Why is that? Because the FDA is wedded to an old model of statistics. I know we don't want to talk about it -- More certainty. The more patients you can enroll in a clinical trial, the better the -- -- potential or value. I -- All right. Because they were willing to embrace uncertainty years ago -- -- when it came these drugs. It was a different culture. There was a sense that there weren't a lot of drugs for a lot of these diseases. And now, they have the sense that there is sort of abundance of riches, which there really isn't, when it comes to unmetmedical needs. The problem is that the mindset that guides the development of new drug for hypertension, which we might all agree should be fairly rigorous, because we have good drugs for those diseases, infects every other corner of the FDA. They don't make distinctions between drugs for very rare, very -- --difficult disorders. Not enough. They do it in the oncology division, to a point. Absolutely.",2.0
against,"I have trouble with that. You know, I -- you know, the FDA is a public health agency. And the public health is a broadly considered status of the general health of the public, some of which are at risk, many of which are not, and are treated with either drugs or devices. And I think that the FDA is required to look to the public health, broadly, in all of its decision-making. Now, has it become bureaucratic? Has there been slowdowns? I mean, I think my partner Jerry mentioned that 50 percent of the salaries of the staff at the FDA who are looking at, quote, “our public health,” yours and mine, are now salaried by the industries that they're regulating. Now, somehow that doesn't smellright to me. I think there's a built-in conflict there -- structural conflict that the Congress has allowed, that we need to look at. But --",2.0
for,"We should -- I mean, we should talk a little about medical devices as well here. A lot of the problems that you talked about medical devices are engineering problems. But your solution is more credible data. And you're not going to be able to solve engineering problems with clinical data.

That's an engineering problem and you need to understand the biomechanics of that lead and when it's going to -- Exactly. And literally, a company will sit with a tester and go like this with it 10,000 million times to see what it looks like. FDA would test it that way, but the solution that you're proposing and the solution you proposed with the IOM panel was more clinical data for those devices. And I'm saying you're not going to ferret out those kinds of challenges. I mean, some of the challenges you're talking, maybe you would. But many of them, you wouldn't. I'll give you another anecdote. The minimally invasive aortic valve, right now, before a year ago, to have your aortic valve repaired when it became brittle, you had to have open heart surgery. If you went to Europe, you could get a catheter to insert a new valve through a minimally invasive procedure, much like a cardiac catheterization. 30,000 Europeans had that valve implanted in them before it was approved here in the United States. It took us four years since it was approved in Europe to finally approve it here. And FDA was requiring companies to put it in pigs and sheep when there were thousands of Europeans walking around with it in their chest. Now, you explain to me why we couldn't learn more from those Europeans and the clinical data that was generated there than we're going to learn from pigs and sheep. And another answer --",2.0

One is to the side that's arguing against the motion that the FDA is overall cautious, your opponents have talked about the fact that people will die waiting for drugs because of this process. And I want to put that to you. And then to the other side, they've gone through a list of horror stories that are real. And I want to -- I want to hear your response to that. First, to the side that's arguing against the motion that the FDA is overall cautious, they -- they've laid out a pretty good argument that in fact the slowness of the approval process, which they say is getting worse and worse, means that people are dying when they could -- if they could get into the trials, if they could get the drug released, put on the market. And whatever it is, the way that they could get access to it around the testing process, the more people would be alive today. There's a logic to it, and I'd like to hear your response to it.",2.0
against,"There's a logic to it, but there's not facts to it. I think laying out a pretty good argument would require that there be data to substantiate it, and I think the data are pretty clear that we are not slower than other countries on earth. On average, we are faster, and we have access to drugs granted in the United States faster than they are in other countries. And so while the concept of a bunch of pointy-headed bureaucrats waking up in the morning in Washington saying, ""How can I hurt people who are sick?"" that's not the way the FDA operates. In fact, they are every bit as fast, at least on the drug side, which I'm more familiar with --",2.0

If -- to speak about this new TB drug, if I were a patient with tuberculosis, I don't think I would want to have accelerated access to a drug that quintuples my risk of death, doesn't treat tuberculosis, and then have to wait ten years to find out if it really works. So a drug that is -- That's a really interesting ethical issue that brings up the issue of Laetrile, which many people will have remembered. That was an extract of apricot pits. And a lot of patients wanted to get it because they had cancer. And back in, what, the 1960s or '70s, people thought that cured cancer. I don't think we should give access to treatments that haven't been shown to work to people, however much they want it.

The FDA doesn't license a drug. It licenses a drug plus a label. The label is saying, is it safe and effective in these circumstances of use? And the FDA is not developing any of that science.

Yondelis is a -- I don't want to be an advertiser for the drug company -- a lot of people think it's a very good drug for sarcoma, where there's no available for therapy. What's the harm in making it available here? Watching it closely, allowing doctors who treat that disease -- it's just a small community of physicians who treat that disease -- to use it. I agree with you that there should be vigilant post-market follow-up; FDA has tools to do that. They can be holding the drug companies accountable, and should be. But what's the harm in making it available? Trusting physicians to use it appropriately? Some won't, many will. Trusting patients to make informed judgments. Some won't, many will. The first thing I would say to them is my heart goes out to you. Thalidomide was a terrible tragedy and it involved kids. And any parent, and I am one, that -- it just breaks your heart to read this, okay? I will add that it was a drug from the 1950s. And so, then, I would -- and then now, I'd like to tell you the follow-up on thalidomide. This does not excuse anything that was done back then. It wasn't, of course, licensed in the United States, but it was licensed abroad. You know that thalidomide is licensed as a drug in the United States today, you know? And you know it was -- in fact, it was given accelerated approval through theFDA, was rushed through, and they used the -- an incredibly clever dodge -- whoever -- whichever lawyer thought of -- Well, well, just -- Well -- Just a second. The question is, when you don't understand a thing about what drugs are doing, you make horrendous mistakes. And we've made many in the past. And many of the examples, certainly in Dr. Avorn's book, are about misuse of estrogen, which dates way back, decades; and diet drugs, which have been used for all sorts of non-medical purposes and so on. You know, I -- nobody wants tragedies, but the way you don't -- I would rather prevent them than apologize for them and regret them. The pharmacoepidemiologists find them out late. The people who looked for the biomarkers that control how a drug performs find safety biomarkers too. Dr. Avorn has gotten -- has done important work on liver toxicity with a drug called Rezulin. There are biomarkers for liver toxicity. We should be looking whether they're explaining the liver toxicity when you try the next Rezulin. You get them on the label and you don't prescribe these things. Let's fix problems, not just lament them.",2.0
against,"The question is based on the premise -- well, there're two aspects. One is based on the premise that there are all these great drugs out there that the FDA is keeping from people. And I would submit that that fact is simply incorrect. There are not a lot of great drugs out there that are being kept from people that we know work. Now, you raise a second question, which is an interesting philosophical, libertarian issue. Should the government ever say to a patient, “There's a chemical you want to take and you're --you have a doctor that you found that wants to give it to you; we don't think you should have it because we don't think it's safe or effective.” I think there is a legitimate political difference within -- certainly on the stage and the audience. I believe that we need to have a governmental agency that does say, “Yeah, you can't have that drug. And we don't know if it works. We have a system of drug approvals. It has not approved. No, you can't have it.” And that may be seen as a violation of individual freedom. But, you know, so is the right to, you know, go through red lights and a lot of other things are not in necessarily society's interest.",2.0
for,"Yeah. I think we need to think about -- you're talking about the drugs that, you know, you don't see a whole plethora of drugs that just aren't available after they've been developed. I think we need to also think about the drugs that never get developed. I'll give you an example. Polycystic kidney disease: basically, it's an inherited disorder where you build up cysts in your kidneys and eventually go on to have total renal failure. You're very familiar with it. FDA says that in order to demonstrate efficacy for a drug for polycystic kidney disease, you have to see how many patients go on to have renal failure versus, let's say, a placebo, instead of looking at cyst formation. But the problem is it takes 30 years to develop renal failure as a result of polycystic kidney disease. If you could use a reduction in cyst formation as the endpoint in the trial and show that a new drug reduces the formation of cysts, it seems intuitive, you're not going to progress as quickly to renal failure. But they want you to look for the out -- the clinical outcome, renal failure. And guess what? Companies have walked away from developing drugs for polycystic kidney disease. So those drugs just are simply aren't being developed. And that's what I worry most about. It's not the drugs that are getting licensed in Europe and not here. It's the ones that simply aren't being developed. I would be -- I'd tell you what the very best systems are out there today, to my knowledge, okay? And they are the ones that have, unfortunately not mainly during the FDA trials, but post-market, okay, accumulated huge databases of massive amounts of molecular data and clinical data. IBM is pioneering some of this work. Their HIV computers outperform doctors. You give a patient profile, root of entry, the -- what country you're in, these things, and they are doing massive searches through very large amounts of molecular data, and they give you precision, custom-tailored -- the best possible prescriptions you can get. You get those prescriptions only when you've accumulated a lot of patient-specific data and a lot of clinical data. We should start doing that during the FDA clinical trials. We don't. The question presupposes -- The question presupposes that we actually know a lot about the drugs that go through the full-blown clinical trials versus the ones that go through the accelerated approval. And I would say that we don't. There's a lot that we don't know. And to pick on -- topick up on your field, what do you think would happen if we randomized every NSAID on the market to placebo and did a ten-year cardiovascular outcome study? Do you think that some of those NSAIDs would show the same cardiovascular risk that was shown with the Vioxx which Dr. Avorn talked about? I suspect that they would. We don't know about the latent cardiovascular risks with most of the drugs on the market because we haven't looked for it, and we never will because it's impractical and impossible to do that study. So the advice I give patients, and take myself, is if I'm taking a drug, I make sure I really need it. Well, let me put it -- -- this way. If you outlawed it, as some people suggest we should, or actually crack down -- and by the way, under the federal drug law, it's quite clear doctors have a right to practice off-label medicine. But oncology would essentially shut down if you actually prohibited this. Oncology is all toolkits. ""All"" is not true, but some of the cocktails go through FDA licensing scripts. The vast majority of oncology today is doctors looking at drugs that have a particular molecular medicine – a mechanism unknown. Theyunderstand, gee, if I do this to the breast cancer cell, I'll frac this receptor. And they're sequencing the tumor of multiple points in the body and are finding all sorts of different ways to attack it, and they’re -- that's how they do it. There's some areas you just have to do that. Look, look, many people my age and others, you know, are taking fistfuls of drugs all the time. I mean -- I think, to tell you the truth, and I don't necessarily want to go here, I do -- I think I am quite confident that in our lifetimes, with this massive convergence of digital and biochemical technology and our ability to acquire all this data, we will get increasingly personalized. We will get to the point where the information is there, where the people best qualified to decide how to prescribe one or more drugs to this patient, will be the doctor and patient, because you've got a unique body there. You have a massive record of how things connect to each other. And Bayesians know how to draw those networks. They're doing it --",2.0
against,"There is a tendency to believe that we can do anything with big data and that if we just let anyone use any chemicals they want and have a big enough database and a powerful enough computer, it'll all kind of come out in the wash. And I know a little bit about that because that's the kind of research we do in my division. And it doesn't work like that. The reason that we've had clinical trials of the randomized kind for the last many decades is that that's a very powerful tool for learning what works and what doesn't. And saying, “We'll just observe a whole lot of people and see how they do,” is not going to give us the answer. I think the physicians' question is a really key one. The time that we get information about how well a drug works and what its side effects are is heavily centered on the FDA evaluation and the studies the companies bring to the FDA. If we shortcut that, we lose the opportunity to really understand the question that physicians face every day: How well does it work, and how well can I trade off those benefits for the risks that I know that it might also cause? And if we don't collect that information, we're all just kind of shooting blind when we prescribe those drugs in the future.",2.0
for,"Well, look, there's a lot of federal -- Is it accurate, what, that the FDA's captured by the industry because the user fees help fund -- No, it's not accurate. I mean, there's a long precedent of user fees being used to help offset the costs of government agencies, state agencies, federal agencies, other models for it in the federal government. You're paying, really, for the review times, the review process. You're not paying for the outcome. And I think that there is something to be said for the industry that's regulated sitting down periodically with the agency that regulates it to talk about how that process is working and to help talk about how funds can be provided to improve how that process is working. There is -- this actually works. And if you look back at the original PDUFA legislation, written into that legislation was language from Congress describing to FDA how to hold a meeting. Now, I would say FDA's management, and the management of the drug review process, is a whole lot better today as a result of the user fees. And they don't need instructions from Congress anymore on how to hold a meeting. But that's the way it was back then. And the user fees are a big reason that the management of that agency has improved so much.",2.0

The industry knows they're going to have to pay it. They're not going to be able to withdraw it. It's not even a thought.",2.0
against,"It is an important question as to when you can use a surrogate measure, the kind that was discussed for polycystic kidneys or other conditions, and when you have to wait for a clinical outcome. But it's not the case that the FDA doesn't look at surrogate measures. In fact, it does all the time in order to speed drug review. They have something called a critical path initiative which is designed to figure out when can you use a surrogate measure and when you have to wait for a clinical event. But there's a downside to surrogate measures we can't forget out. A surrogate measure used to approve diabetes drugs was whether your blood sugar does down. Most of us thought that was a great idea until it turned out that Avandia lowers your blood sugar and causes heart attacks. And so, it's an important balance to know when is it okay to use the surrogate measure and when isn't it? It's not always okay. And we just need to get more thoughtful and astute about that. No. To be clear, I don't think we're saying that. I think we're saying both -- -- me and David Challoner, and the approval of devices, and in my case, the approval of drugs, there's a lot of exciting possibilities for looking at genetics, for looking at molecular markers. We're totally in favor of that. And I think one of the most important misstatements made by the other side is that FDA doesn't want to look at this and doesn't care. FDA very much is trying to look at this. They just want to get the science right. So it's a myth that the FDA is -- -- not willing to consider -- I want to hold onto a careful view of the science, because to not get too statistically wonky, I think it's pretty clear that if you just give, you know, a sugar pill or garlic or anything to a bunch of people with cancer, there will be people who get better, because sometimes people's cancers get better no matter what. And what is at risk here is the idea that that tail of the curve that may have nothing whatever to do with the substance, because we see in -- with placebo, someone's going to say, “Ah ha! That's the subgroup that needed to have this drug, even though there's no molecular basis for believing that.” There's always going to be some people who get better from a bad disease with placebo, because that's the way -- I want to hold onto having a high standard for when a biomarker or a surrogate measure or another assessment of a drug is accepted as really being scientifically true. Well, I think the fallacy in the other side's argument is that there's always going to be people who get better no matter what you do. And if you attribute that to a drug, you're going to approve a lot of drugs that not only aren't helping people -- because those same people --",2.0
for,"You know, I think the issue is about caution and risk. And embracing these new kinds of technologies takes a certain degree of risk. And it takes people at the agency outside that comfort zone. And where I think we're arguing is that the agency is just not willing to embrace the risk; they're wedded to a very old model of doing things. And they haven't moved out of their comfort zone. Sure, they have pilot programs. I started the Critical Path Initiative with Dr. McClellen. But they haven't progressed, because ultimately, the leadership can talk about these ideas and does, but when it filters down to the review level, the reviewers ultimately feel uncomfortable moving outside the established models and taking the risk that it would take to adopt those kinds of innovations.",2.0

against,"We've heard thalidomide mentioned a couple of times tonight. And I think that may be a good thing to remember as you vote and as you think about whether the FDA's too cautious or not. Before the thalidomide debacle, there were some amendments in Washington that Senator Kefauver had put forward, saying that, in 1962, the agency ought to have the right to make a manufacturer show that their drugs actually worked. That was not a requirement in 1961; that was something which was being debated in the Senate. And by all accounts, the Kefauver amendments were going to go down in flames, because we had people saying, “Oh, we can't let big government get between the doctor and the patient. We can't restrict the liberty of Americans to take whatever they want. We can't have doctors' hands tied by having this government agency saying whether or not a drug is allowed to be sold for a given purpose.” Right before the amendment went down in flames, it turned out that there were women who had children being born all over Europe, Japan, Africa, with little deformities. And many of you have seen these pictures. Instead of arms and legs, they had little flippers, as well as a lot of internal organ damage. And that was because the company was making a drug called thalidomide, called a lot of other things in other countries, as a sedative and anti-nauseant that was particularly marketed aggressively to pregnant women. And there was a reviewer in the FDA named Dr. Frances Kelsey. Itwas her first task to review this drug. She’s still alive, in her 90s, living in Washington. And she said, “No, I don't think there's enough safety information. We don't need another sedative or anti-nauseant for pregnant women.” And almost singlehandedly, she caused the drug to not be available or to deny it to the American public. As a result, thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands of American kids were not born with these anomalies. That's changed around the legislation -- FDA was given the power in the wake of the thalidomide crisis to say, “Yeah, you’ve got to show that your drug is safe and effective before we're going to let you sell it.” I don't think we want to go back to a pre-thalidomide era by weakening the FDA.",3.0
for,"I want to come back to that drug for Hunter's Disease, Elaprase, I talked about at the outset. When that data from that study were released, the results were impressive. Patients getting the drug could walk 44 meters farther in five minutes than before getting the drug. By comparison, most of the children on the sugar pills showed no improvement and many saw their condition worsen. Science Daily, at the time, relayed the experience of 16-year-old Cody Paxton, one of the first patients enrolled in the trial. And he said, quote, “My breathing is better and I'm more energetic,” unquote. And he said he could put his hand behind his back, which he couldn't do before receiving Elaprase. Most of the patients forced to take that placebo, however, saw their joint disease worsen and advance, making future treatment much more difficult. I'd like to say that the kids who got the placebo would regain all the function they lost during that trial, but many would not. I'd like to say that companies are still developing drugs for these enzyme disorders, but no new companies have entered this space since that time. And only one subsequent drug has been approved for any of these diseases. And I'd like to say that the FDA reviewer in charge of imposing the Elaprase trial isn't handling drug reviews anymore, but he's actually been promoted and now sets drug review policy for the entire FDA.FDA reviewers are not oblivious to the human cost that we talked about here tonight. But the culture they operate under isn't suited well to minimizing them. By implementing a few key reforms, some of which we've talked about tonight, and modernizing the science of regulation, FDA could modernize its culture and improve its ability to keep Americans both healthy and safe.",3.0
against,"Thank you, John. The conversation tonight is obviously focused very highly on pharmaceuticals and not devices. And I understand the reasons for that. But my comments at this point actually would, I think, in the end, help both processes, as long as the FDA was an active, engaged organization. Most voluntary reporting of problems on drugs or devices by patients, the public, the media, health professions, healthcare organizations such as clinics and hospitals, generally first go to industry and then go from industry to the FDA. Legal counsel at many of these organizations are loathe to report due to liability concerns for their own client. What does get to industry is supposed to be reported to FDA, but some estimates put the data that FDA receives as reflecting only 1 to 2 percent of adverse events that actually occur with devices and drugs to the FDA. Moreover, these anecdotes are not informed by any knowledge of the denominator of the report. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Therefore, I would like to say that as things are managed currently, for now, you must reject the premise that the FDA's caution is hazardous to our health.",3.0

And I -- and I have been lamenting, in case you haven't noticed, the FDA's dreadful failure to move molecular medicine systematically into its protocols. And it's had 20 years to do this, you know, and to tell us that they're working on it, you know, it's too late now. When they're done, vote for the other side. But for tonight, you know, vote for our side. But let me -- I would like to give you just a taste, which blew my mind when I read this, of the incredible new powers that medicine acquires once it begins doing molecular medicine, you know, from scratch, thinking mechanistically about what drugs actually do. True story: Six-year-old Emily Whitehead was on -- you may have read this in the Times. You know, was on the brink of death after a two-year battle with leukemia. Her doctors extracted from some of her cancerous cells some signature molecules and moved them into some of her healthy immune system cells. Exactly as planned, they went in a -- into a wild attack on their cancerous siblings, so wild that they overproduced a molecular -- an immune system signaling molecule, a cytokine. One of her doctors knew that an arthritis drug, of all things, controls cytokines. He prescribed a massive dose. Emily -- the ICU staff gathered to sing happy birthday when Emily awoke from her coma on the day she turned seven. The Times ran her story just before Christmas, and Emily is healthy to this day, and cancer free. We should be simply appalled, you know, that, you know, intense molecular tracking and learning on the fly and measuring everything you possibly can in sight during clinical trials isn't an -- I mean, isn't just the norm today rather than an exception you have to go through to -- a special rule to even find. What are we thinking when we tell the doctors, you know, to put on blindfolds and do no adaptation, no significant learning during the trials? The diseases that are probably going to kill you, and you, and you, and me, and the people we love are going to require complex arrays of drugs, you know, prescribed in complex ways. We have to do molecular medicine. The FDA isn't doing it.",3.0
