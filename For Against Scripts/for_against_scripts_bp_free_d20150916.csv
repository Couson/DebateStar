for," And welcome to the second most important debate happening in America tonight. It's a -- it's a deep honor to be here, and I want to thank the organizers and also you, the audience, for coming. So, yes, one of my daughters is a college sophomore. The other just started law school. I'm very concerned about keeping our campuses safe from sexual assault. That's a goal that everyone on this stage shares. But the way to achieve that goal is not by having colleges conduct rape trials when they're incompetent to do it. I'm about to use some strong words. I wouldn't do it except that this is the reality, and we need to face it. As the result of campus sexual assault trials, actual rapists all over the country are going free to rape again, while innocent people -- it's impossible to know how many. But I'm talking about people who haven't committed Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 9/17/2015 any sexual assault at all -- are being found guilty and having their lives wrecked by an error ridden, unreliable process that's filled with conflicts of interest and violations of due process, all of it covered by a thick layer of non-transparency. Now, my partner, Jeannie, is going to cover the serious due process violations, so I'm going to talk to you about the basic competency and neutrality and transparency issues. But there's something extremely important to both Jeannie and me. I want to say it first, that this is not, for us, a debate between the rights of the accused versus the rights of the victim. An incompetent process produces errors on both sides. It's unfair to both victims and the accused. The errors run in both directions, and I will give you examples of those in a moment. But first, just some quick background on how we got to where we are today. In 2011, the federal government sent a letter to every college and university in the country telling them that if they didn't start trying rape cases they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding penalties, and forcing us to comply with a set of procedures dictated by the government, including, for example, lowering the standard of proof. Now, I'm sure this letter was well intentioned. But the problem is that college trials totally lack the necessary expertise, neutrality and transparency. Let me start with competence. The primary forensic tool in a rape case -- you've probably heard of it -- it's a rape kit. It's basically a medical forensic examination of the victim. Now, most college personnel don't even know what a rape kit is. Or say a woman believes she was the victim of a date rape drug. Say she was the victim. That kind of case requires a laboratory toxicology result. That's how you make that case. Most colleges do not run such laboratories and can't do that. A recent college rape case was decided by a panel of three judges, one person from engineering, one from food services, and one foreign exchange student. In another case, an accused male student was essentially acquitted not because he was found innocent, but because he broke down at the hearing and admitted his alcoholism problem. The woman accuser was stunned to see her rapist sitting in class with her the next week. At Stanford, the teaching manual for rape judges includes an article saying that if the accused act -- if the accused acts as if he's the victim, that's an indicator of guilt. Another indicator of guilt is if he, quote, ""Acts logical and persuasive."" This kind of -- I'm not kidding. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 9/17/2015 This kind of incompetent decision making is leading to miscarriages of justice of a kind you wouldn't imagine in America. And how about impartiality? In our courts, we have a process we've worked out for centuries to ensure that our judges and juries are disinterested, that they don't know the parties, don't know anybody who does know the parties, that they're not subject to rumors and pressures. In college rape trials, it's the opposite. These are people from the same community. They are subject to pressures. They sometimes know the parties. They sometimes know people who do know the parties. Athlete -- athletic coaches decide if athletes committed rape. Students decide cases involving students. Now, again, these conflicts, they hurt victims and accused alike. In some cases, colleges have a huge incentive to sweep rape cases under the rug, to cover them up. And that can lead to guilty people being found innocent. In other cases, it's the opposite. Especially today, colleges are feeling a lot of pressure under threat from the federal government to show how seriously they take these cases and to make an example. And that can lead to innocent people being found guilty, to be expelled, and if their names leak out, to be branded with a stigma that they have no way to ever clear themselves of. Compare this to what happens when a murder takes place on a college campus. We don't hold campus homicide trials. We all expect the police, the DA, the FBI and the courts to take charge. Rape is a crime as serious as homicide. It's not like plagiarism or cheating on an exam. That's the kind of thing college disciplinary panels are good at. We should treat rape with the same seriousness as we do other major crimes. But worst of all, I haven't even gotten to the worst thing of all. What happens when the college rape trial works just the way it's supposed to work; when an actual rapist is found guilty? What happens next? Let me ask you a question. If you had proof that somebody in your neighborhood had committed an act of rape, what was the -- what's the worst possible thing you could do? Here's the worst thing: Push that person out of your neighborhood, but never tell anybody else what happened. Keep his name confidential. That literally is what colleges do in these cases. They expel the student but keep his identity a total secret because the college process, unlike a court, has no transparency. It's all covered with confidentiality. And I can't stress how important this is. Some empirical studies out there have suggested that up to 90 percent of college rapes are being committed by fewer than 5 percent of college men, a relative handful of serial rapists, averaging over six rapes each. Yet colleges, when they catch these serial rapists, simply push them out of their neighborhood, leaving them free to commit sexual assault elsewhere, their secret kept safe within the college bureaucracy. That's why we need courts to handle these cases. Now finally, it's critical to acknowledge that the courts are far from perfect, the police are far from perfect. Too often in the past they have failed victims of sexual assault.  We have to do better. And in the end, it's not courts or colleges, one or the other. That's a kind of debating artificiality. We all know that both have a role to play. There's a huge amount colleges can do, but they should be focused on education and prevention, which they can do well, not on adjudication which they can't. Ideally, we bridge the gap. Get colleges and police working together. That's what I've advocated, and it's happening. Here in New York, there's just been the creation of a special sexual assault enforcement unit, first of its kind in the country. It's specifically designed to go out and work with both colleges and local police to help them get together and do their jobs better. But the primary responsibility for investigating and trying rape cases has to be with police and courts. That's what we're asking you to vote for. A vote for our side of this debate is a vote that not campuses, but courts should be the primary place where rape trials are conducted. And we urge you --",
for,-- to vote that way.,1.0
against,"Courts should decide sexual assault cases when a victim reports to the police, when the police take it seriously and investigate, when a prosecutor takes it seriously and pursues it, and the case finally lands in a court of law. In these circumstances, courts should decide sexual assault cases. No one disagrees. The only thing this debate is about is between two commas, ""Not campuses."" The resolution strips jurisdiction from campuses to also decide sexual assault cases.  Now, colleges and universities exist to generate and transmit knowledge. And they cannot do that job unless they have a safe learning environment in which to do it. They also cannot single out sexual assault cases and push them to the criminal courts, unlike all the other cases they deal with, without harming the learning environment and without violating the civil rights of students. My colleague, Stephen Schulhofer will talk about the problems that happen when cases are pushed to the criminal law involuntarily. For now, I'll just note that there's a reason why 95 percent of sexual assault victims on campus never report to the police. They do not believe that justice will be served. A college student reported having been raped to the New York City police department. The officer scoffed. ""You invited him into your dorm room. That's not the legal definition of rape."" Another officer chimed in. ""For every single rape I've had, I've had 20 reports that are total bullshit."" That's not from 1970. That story is from 2014. The fact is that bias against victims of sexual assault has a well-documented, 200 year history in the criminal justice system. But even when the system harbors no bias whatsoever, campuses must be able to decide sexual assault cases. Courts and campuses have different interests in these cases and different remedies. Let me explain. When a campus sexual assault happens, a victim needs immediate safety and protection. Campuses can take protective measures to ensure a safe educational environment; stagger classes, move someone from a dorm, issue reprimands, suspend students. These remedies are not available in the court. The university's role is unavoidable because campuses must preserve students' ability to learn. Since the early part of the 19th century, colleges and universities have always disciplined students independent of the criminal law. They've had to. Throughout time, students incite riots, they assault, they plagiarize, they harass. Some of these acts are criminal, some are not. But just to clarify, campuses are not prosecuting criminal charges in trials. They're pursuing violations of their own disciplinary codes, which do not lead to criminal convictions or imprisonment. And colleges cannot wait around to see if the police are interested in the case. Let me give you an example. In 2013 a college fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania ended in the death of a pledge by blunt force trauma to the head. The coroner ruled the death a homicide, but the prosecutor did not pursue charges until Monday, almost two years later. Now, the university had an independent interest in the case. It pursued immediate disciplinary action against the students who hazed and killed the other student. And it suspended them. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - 9/17/2015 Now, fraternity hazing and homicide are serious crimes, just like rape is a serious crime, but no one in that case said, ""Oh, the courts should be the only one to handle the case. The colleges should get out of the way."" Whether or not criminal charges ever emerge in a case, colleges must decide cases to maintain a safe learning environment, even more so with sexual assault. Title IX is a federal civil rights statute that prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions. And campus sexual assault is a form of discrimination that denies a victim an equal education. Many sexual assault victims suffer serious consequences, depression, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, social withdrawal. These reactions impair their ability to attend class and focus, to pass their classes, to maintain their time in school, to remain in school. As a result, the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights requires schools to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual violence. It requires equal treatment of accuser and accused and demands adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints. Since 2011, campuses have begun pursuing these cases in earnest. Most colleges are working to implement Title IX in a fair and equitable way. You don't hear about them. Some campuses are failing, however. They're either denying victims their rights under Title IX to an equitable education or they're actually violating students' due process during the disciplinary proceedings in ways that Title IX does not require and the Constitution will not stand. In these later cases, students are suing, as you heard. Where colleges have gone wrong, these young men are winning. And these process issues can be worked out intelligently through the courts without taking a meat cleaver to the problem and abolishing or cutting off campus jurisdiction entirely. Let's circle back to the differences between the criminal justice system and Title IX quickly. The criminal justice system is focused on punishment, incarceration, retribution. Title IX by contrast is a civil rights statute. And like most civil rights statutes, it's focused on equality, in this case, educational equality. The criminal justice system cannot insure equality, and it cannot remedy inequality. Campuses have to insure equality. They must provide a safe learning environment to generate and transmit knowledge. Now, I want to end by noting that this debate resolution is actually worse than the House Republican bill that is pending right now in Congress with the Orwellian title, ""The Safe Campus Act."" That bill would prohibit campuses from investigating sexual assault unless the victim reports to the police, and it's being heavily promoted by fraternities. The bill has received near universal opposition from groups that work with actual sexual assault victims as well as opposition from many groups that represent colleges and universities, like the Association of American Universities. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - 9/17/2015 The American Council on Education has expressed grave reservation about any legislation that would limit our ability to insure a safe campus. The effect of this resolution is to eviscerate colleges' ability to insure a safe campus. It would also violate students' civil rights, and it has to be wrong.  ",1.0
for,"I think it's important for us to see that tonight's debate is not just about courts versus campuses. And it's not just about sexual assault. It is a debate about the equality of men and women in our society. In college, I was a rape counselor and an activist, and I've spent my entire life as a feminist on campuses. I have a daughter and a son. And I was optimistic to see colleges take sexual assault more seriously than they had in the past. But the disaster we have seen unfolding around us has made me lose faith. My points tonight will focus on fairness, process, and the connection to equality. What campuses are doing under pressure from the Department of Education is hurting the cause of gender equality. Campus tribunals use procedures that lack basic fairness and often reach inaccurate outcomes. What happens? You're told there's a sexual misconduct complaint against you. But they don't say what it's about or show you the complaint. They don't tell you the evidence or the facts that they're gathering, who the witnesses are, or what they've said. If you're allowed to bring an attorney, which you might not be, your lawyer is barred from speaking. If they give you a live hearing, which they may not, Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 9/17/2015 you can't question the accuser or witnesses. People who weren't even there are asked to give opinions on what happened. Terribly leading questions are asked. And when your attorney objects, she is told that if she speaks again, she'll be ejected. After you're found responsible and suspended, they don't give you a copy of the investigative report, saying that they can't because of student privacy. The investigation and the adjudication may be handled by the same person, and the appeal is to that person's boss. So, everyone is invested in defending the previous actions of the school. When you appeal, you're told you can't challenge the panel's factual findings. And all this is happening because if you're not found guilty, the school fears that the Department of Education will open an investigation that would cost a lot of money to deal with and jeopardize its federal funding. In just the past three months, no fewer than five different courts have ruled for students on claims that their school used unfair procedures, including things that I've just described. The shocking disregard for what Americans know are essentials of fair process deeply harms the cause of taking sexual violence seriously. It reinforces society's skepticism toward rape victims. It causes everyone to doubt that men disciplined for sexual assault are actually guilty. That aggravates the serious problem that we all want to address. And it harms the fight for gender equality. To make matters worse, many schools are now stretching the concept of what sexual assault is far beyond reasonable recognition. If you have sexual contact without an explicit agreement for every stage of a sexual interaction, that might be considered non-consensual. It's a great idea to make sure that each partner is excited about going forward, but move from kissing to touching without pausing for an explicit agreement -- and it can be sexual assault, even if the other person is equally participating in it. Some schools even define consent to mean not only affirmative, but enthusiastic -- even ""creative"" and ""imaginative"" agreement. It may be funny, but anything else is sexual assault. It's obvious that sex with a person incapacitated by alcohol is rape. That is obvious. But schools are now disciplining students when the sexual contact is under the influence of alcohol. All this means that most sexual encounters are violating the rules. So, when one person is kicked out for this and branded a rapist, it feels arbitrary to both men and to women. It is truly bizarre to lump these cases together with rapes and treat them as sexual assaults. Yet, these are most of the cases that colleges are adjudicating today. This came about because of a desire to protect women from coercion. The idea was that men should seek permission, not just wait for women to object to sex. But schools are sending all the wrong messages about women's capacity to be equal, Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - 9/17/2015 mature, and independent. We can date these ideas to about 1880. Women are timid; women are fragile. In the name of protecting college women and making campuses safe, schools are signaling loudly that they do not see women as capable. I don't want my daughter educated to think of herself that way. We need to refocus on what's wrong with sexual violence and refuse these ancient ideas of women's incapacity. Watered-down procedures and overly broad definitions of non-consent make a mockery of a very serious problem and dishonor victims. Our opponents must convince you that a rape on campus is different from a rape anywhere else. It is not. Criminal sexual conduct anywhere deserves criminal response. And our opponents want you to accept that a civil rights option means that it's okay to have lesser procedures. Even if the stakes were civil, the process must be fair, and the stakes are effectively criminal. There is, in fact, so much that campuses should do. It's disturbing to see the bulk of resources going to pseudo investigations and trials. Schools should direct those resources to working with law enforcement. The safety measures that Michelle was talking about, those do not necessarily go hand in hand with an investigation and adjudication, a decision about the responsibility and guilt of a party for committing a crime. You can take safety measures, and campuses do all the time, without having pseudo criminal trials. Schools can engage in rape education, they can address alcohol consumption, and they can work hard to support victims. The answer to shame or stigma about sexual assault is not a campus tribunal mired in secrecy and severe conflicts of interest that is the confidence of nobody. We're going to look back on this period as a mass panic when many people together lost their ability to think clearly about sexual assault and squandered opportunities for promoting gender equality. Campuses should not do shoddily what our courts have been designed over generations to do; decide questions of responsibility and guilt for a crime based on evidence. You should not accept it. You should vote for the motion. Courts, not campuses should decide sexual assault cases.",1.0
against," Courts are certainly finding due process violations all over the place. A lot of colleges have really botched this problem. But I'm very surprised to hear professor Suk cite that as a reason for precluding campus discipline in all these cases. We don't shut down the criminal courts just because appellate courts are finding due process violations in criminal trials. And that happens a lot. So, these decisions show that the system is working. The Department of Education has overreached. Many colleges have overreached, and courts are pushing back. The question we have to decide -- and we all agree that many colleges have done a very poor job. The question that we're debating is whether to fix the problem by requiring the colleges to do better or whether to prevent all campuses from deciding these cases no matter how careful they are. The resolution would make a criminal complaint the victim's only option, even when she doesn't want to go through the stress of the criminal process herself and even when she doesn't want to impose that on a classmate who may have mistreated her, but she doesn't want to see that classmate convicted of a crime. Taking away the option of a campus remedy is obviously bad for sexual assault victims. I don't think there's any possible question about that. And what people are missing here is that sending all these cases to the criminal courts is going to work out very badly for the accused students as well. Suppose a student claims that one of her classmates pushed her onto a sofa, ignored her protests and penetrated her? If a campus panel accepts her story, her classmate might be suspended or even expelled. That could have life-altering consequences. But expulsion is nothing compared to the impact of a criminal conviction for a sex offense. The resolution seems to assume that a criminal conviction requires very clear proof. The reality is actually not so reassuring. Trial lawyers know that proof beyond a reasonable doubt isn't all it's cracked up to be. Victim testimony no longer requires any corroboration or any proof of physical coercion. If the complainant testifies that she said no, and the jury believes her, that's enough. That is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Of course, the jury has to be unanimous to convict. But it also has to be unanimous to acquit. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 9/17/2015 That's one reason why prosecutors typically file multiple charges, from rape down to sexual contact, attempted contact and maybe a few more. So some jurors may have doubts, others don't. And you typically see a compromised verdict. Jurors convict on a minor charge, not even realizing that their verdict can still trigger a harsh sentence. But it gets worse. Most criminal cases end in a plea bargain. And one reason is that a rape conviction can mean more than 15 years in prison. If the prosecutor will accept a plea to attempted rape or sexual contact, the sentence drops to only a year or two in jail. That's a hard offer to refuse, even if the chance of conviction on that top count is only 20 or 30 percent. So technically, you can't get a criminal conviction on a mere preponderance of the evidence. But if the odds of a 15-year sentence are 50/50, that becomes a pretty strong reason to plead guilty to the lesser offense. And bingo, the student who might have faced discipline in a college proceeding, might have been required to change his dorm or even leave school for a semester. That student is now getting jail time and a criminal record without having any court hear any evidence at all. That's the reality for the great majority of cases in our criminal courts. What about less serious cases? Suppose a young man stares at a sophomore in his calculus class, and he keeps making comments about her body? One day, he grabs her butt in the hallway outside of class. That is sexual assault. But sending a contact case like that to the police normally means complete inaction. I hope that's not the resolution's hidden agenda, a world where a lesser sexual assault allegations aren't pursued. But anyone supporting the allegation for that reason is going to get a rude surprise if it were adopted, because if DAs didn't pursue these cases, which is what usually happens now, how can colleges respond to disruption and sexual harassment? It's not clear to me what the supporters of this resolution have in mind. When you put thousands of adolescents together with raging hormones, poor judgment and easy access to alcohol, some of them are going to be rude and aggressive. You can talk about prevention programs, and I'm in favor of them too. But misconduct in that environment is going to happen. And how exactly is a college supposed to respond to stupid, boorish behavior, which is going to happen? Could the college suspend the student for his rude comments because that's not a crime, but not be allowed to suspend him for actually groping her? It doesn't make any sense. But otherwise, unless the DA pursues the case, there couldn't be any sanction at all. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 9/17/2015 And if the college can't discipline its students directly, it will have to pressure police and local prosecutors to press criminal charges. So students who would never face the criminal courts today, adolescents guilty of immaturity and poor judgment would find themselves with a criminal record. No one should want that. But colleges will have to insist on prosecution because they'd have no other basis for imposing sanctions. I think professor Suk said, well, of course, the college can take some action. But does that mean the college is going to be taking action without deciding what happened? That's a kind of odd situation if you're opposing -- if you're supporting the resolution that colleges can't decide these cases, but they can take action without deciding the case, that's even worse than the situation we have now. And I haven't even mentioned sex offender registration. Federal statute called SORNA establishes a national registry with a current address, place of employment and photograph of every convicted sex offender. And it's readily available on the internet, and it's a federal felony for a sex offender to fail to notify local police within three days of every change in residence. People assume these laws only apply to predators who abuse little children, but they cover all sex offenses, even low-level misdemeanors. So this resolution would be a disaster, not only for colleges, but for accused students. They would get less due process in the criminal courts, and we'd see more convictions with consequences far more severe than a college disciplinary record. So that's why it's very important to vote against this resolution. ",1.0
against,"Well, the college system has the advantage that it's not the police, and the public record of the -- -- yeah, yeah.  Well, it's an important advantage. And campus systems vary quite a bit across the country. So some campuses will provide -- the main advantage for victims for the Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

So I emphasize that they can immediately change class schedules or move someone out of a dorm, essentially separating people who -- where there's an allegation of sexual assault, and they can do the kind of remedies that campuses can't engage -- or that courts can't engage in. I have to say, Jeannie -- I'm sorry to jump in here -- -- but I have to say I'm very confused about this. If I'm living in a dorm and I don't like my roommate, I can't go to the college and say, ""I want this person kicked out of the dorm."" You have to have a reason for that, and colleges can't be requiring a student to drop a chemistry class or move out of his dorm or leave campus for a semester unless they decide that there is a reason. So if -- And that, that reason is credible. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - 9/17/2015 -- exactly, that it's credible -- so they had -- if you're saying campuses should not decide these cases but they should take action against the accused without making any decision and without having any process at all, that seems rather an odd idea to me.",2.0
for,"I think there are lots of different ways to make decisions. I think there are decisions made for all kinds of reasons. One -- the decision that we're talking about in this debate, decide sexual assault cases, is a determination of responsibility and guilt for what could be a crime. People do have disputes, like you're talking about, in their dorms. They do go to their resident advisor and say, ""I'm having a problem,"" and sometimes they're brought in to have a mediation, to have a talk, to resolve, and they could -- colleges can advise and guide. And actually the Department of Education says, when it comes to the sexual misconduct matters, that's not even allowed. You have to go through some kind adjudicative process to decide the guilt of the party.",2.0
against," Well, I guess I'm just wondering, why is sexual assault different than any other offense that's committed on campus? In other words, these kinds of offenses routinely go through adjudicative processes. And there's no reason to pull sexual assault as opposed to any number of other kinds of cases, and say, ""Well, that particular one has to go to the criminal courts, but the hazing case that led to the death of a student, or the plagiarism case, or an assault case, those can be adjudicated through a disciplinary process that is routine?""",2.0
for,"Well, I don't think that's a fair characterization, Michelle. Look, it's really rare -- really rare to have colleges adjudicate a homicide. That almost never happens. It's really rare - - almost never happens for colleges to try and adjudicate an act of arson. Rape is as serious a crime as homicide and arson. We do not typically -- we have never typically adjudicated major serious crimes like that. Plagiarism, yes, of course. Colleges are good at that. They know about that.  Hazing, fraternity stuff, that's a college problem. It makes sense for colleges to deal with hazing.

It's very important. For some reason, the other side is trying to characterize the resolution before you as barring colleges from doing anything about this, barring them from hearing these kind of claims. That's not true. That's not what the resolution does. The resolution says, ""Courts, not campuses, should decide."" Not barring them. The question is for you all to send a message that the body that should decide these cases are courts, not campuses, for all the reasons we have said. It's -- as John said at the beginning of this debate, the question before you, ""Is it preferable for courts to be deciding?"" And in an ideal world, if colleges could do it just as well, fine. But unfortunately, it's been a disaster. And the right answer is that courts should be the ones deciding.",2.0
against," I think that we read the resolution slightly differently. And I think that as a normative matter, the victim should decide whether or not she or he wishes to pursue a criminal claim with the police. And that is what should happen. And when the victim feels that she will be received or he will be received appropriately, and the justice can be served through the criminal justice system, that's the appropriate route for it to go. But there should also be an option for the victim to receive different kinds of redress through the campus justice system and through a process that provides different remedies and allows for immediate safety on campus. If I might add, there also -- I -- Professor Rubenfeld really lost me there completely, because if all the -- all that you're arguing in favor of is that courts should do it, but you're not opposed to campuses doing it, I don't understand your opening remarks with all the criticism of the lack of due process, and the conflicts of interest, and everything else. We acknowledge that that happens. And we think it should be fixed. But I think the thrust of your arguments is that campuses have no business deciding these cases. And we think that they -- not only they do have a business. They must deal with the situation where, for example, a student in our chemistry lab keeps getting groped by someone at the next lab table. They have to deal with that.

Now, what's happening is that this term is getting expanded, as Jeannie was saying to mean -- cover a whole lot of other things. And Stephen's argument about this groping thing is, you wouldn't want that in a criminal court. Police aren't going to prosecute. If courts -- if campuses want to have a code against offensive touching, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, sure, those are things that campuses could do well. And they should be able to do that. We are talking about sexual assault here. Let's not expand that term so that it means all kinds of things -- other things and confuse the issue.",2.0

There is no question about that. That is a crime. She could go to the cops. That is a terrific question, John. It's a terrific question, and it's crucial to all of this, because on campus, you're talking about the victim's ability to pursue her education in a safe environment. And if the person who's -- on the subway, you can get off the subway and hopefully in a city of 8 million people, you won't see the person again. But when he's in your chemistry class -- Yes.

The conflicts of interest, though, that we're talking about are not just one-off conflicts of interest. We're talking about structural conflict of interest, where we're talking about a Title IX officer who is charged with compliance with the Department of Education's dictates. And they are terrified about what's going to happen if they don't find a certain way, they don't do things a certain way.

Historically, before the Department of Education strongly encouraged mandated that courts get -- that campuses get involved in these cases, the incentives for campuses were to sweep these cases under the rug. Let's not -- we don't want the bad publicity. Let's put it under the rug.  The Department of Education mandates that campuses get involved and equitably and promptly adjudicate these cases. On the -- so that's powerful incentive to pursue these cases. However, on the other side, you've got all of these claims brought by accused students, indicate -- claiming that their due process rights were violated. That's powerful incentive the other way to provide due process. So you have two kinds of incentives on both sides. And that will lead to more equitable and fair outcomes. If there were no incentives to pursue these cases, campuses would not pursue them, and they would sweep them under the rug in the way that they have historically. If there were only pressure one way and no pushback by the accused students when their rights have been violated, you'd have a problem. But you have pressure on both sides.

You don't want to give colleges an incentive to find a certain way, either way. And today, now they have this incentive to make examples, to show how seriously they're taking these things. And you can't say, well, now they've got pressures on both sides and it'll come out fine.  Two conflicts of interest don't equal impartiality.",2.0

What's the alternative? Sending these cases, pulling these cases out alone and saying, if it were sexual assault, you want a difference between sexual assault and rape. If it were rape, that needs to go to the criminal court. But if it were sexual misconduct or groping or sexual assault, then campuses can adjudicate that. How does that make even sense?",2.0

The alternative is you call the police, you expect them to do a professional, proper investigation, and you encourage students to report to the police. We heard earlier tonight that only about 5 percent of college women students who are victims are reporting. That's a huge problem. The alternative is to work better between colleges and the police to encourage reporting, to get these cases into the criminal justice system where rapists can get the punishment that they should get, and we can make our campuses and communities safer.",2.0
against,"John -- Yes, thanks. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - 9/17/2015 I just was hoping to get some clarification about whether Professor Rubenfeld and Professor Suk are really in agreement, because as I heard Professor Rubenfeld, he was saying, well, what sexual assault means for purposes of this resolution is not what it means in the criminal law. What it means is rape. And rape should go to the criminal courts because that's a very serious crime. But if it's groping, some woman who can't do her lab work because the guy next to her is just some immature jerk, if that's all it is, then the campus can adjudicate that. As I understood Professor Suk, she was saying that the conflicts of interest are endemic and insoluble. And Professor Rubenfeld actually said that you can't solve one conflict -- offset one conflict with another. So to -- you know, I think got great responsiveness from the audience. But what are we saying about -- I mean, is it the case that campuses are just completely unable to fix the problems, and therefore they can't decide any of these cases, and that woman just has to tough it out?",2.0
for,"So I have prosecuted that case here in Manhattan. There were people being groped every day in Times Square. And it is incorrect, as was suggested earlier -- Yeah. Yes, exactly. So that -- that's a crime just like it was in -- if it was in Times Square, it's a crime. And if it happens in a chemistry lab, it's also a crime. At that point, like any victim, this victim has the discretion whether to report to the police or not to the police. Many of us have been victims of crimes. Many of us have made a decision whether what -- whatever kind of crime it was, whether it was worth it to us to pursue the crime or not.  And she -- in my opinion, if I were her advisor, I would say, ""Go to the police because this is a crime, and a crime has been committed against you, the person will be arrested."" Well, if we were living in a reasonable world with a reasonable department of education, what would actually happen, what could happen is the possibility that short of an -- a police-like investigation and a law-like court type of tribunal, you would have some reasonable parties get involved, talk to the people, and say, you know, ""What's going on here? This is not acceptable. Bad, bad, bad person.  Don't do it anymore."" And, you know, as Stephen suggested, these are adolescents with raging hormones and exercising bad judgment. There are some cases like that. But what Jed was talking about was serious cases of rape and sexual assault. Now, ""sexual assault"" is an ambiguous term because it includes rape and in some jurisdictions it includes other things. In other jurisdictions, sexual assault is separate from rape. So there's a little bit of an ambiguity about what we're talking about. But what we are talking about essentially is serious crimes involving sex such as rape.",2.0
against,"Well, I think that we still need to know how to deal with this groping case, and we still need to know -- Professor Rubenfeld said, ""Let's encourage women to take all this to the criminal courts."" I do not want to do that. I do not want to see this immature adolescent put on a sex offender registry for the rest of his life.",2.0
for,"I think there's a ton to learn. So in -- if this happened in the workplace, the federal law called Title VII would provide a way for that person to sue their employer for failing to prevent or to address a hostile work environment. Now, Title IX also is a law that one could use to sue one’s school for failing to address a hostile environment. Now, there are many ways to address a hostile environment. Do they all involve an investigation and an adjudication and a kind of tribunal like that?  There are many ways to do the work that an educational institution, consistent with this pedagogical mission, to educate its students, to nurture them, to promote a kind of culture where sexual harassment is not considered acceptable.",2.0
against,"Well, I must say -- and I appreciate the response, that resonates with the audience -- but I must say that in the workplace we don't just say, ""Well, the employer has to hold sensitivity training for his employees."" If the -- if, in fact, there was groping, then the employee has to be -- the employee who did it has to be disciplined and know if an employer can't get away with his responsibility by just saying, ""I'm going to ramp up my sensitivity training."" Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - 9/17/2015 And I think your question is excellent because it is exactly analogous, unlike the subway situation, the woman who's trying to pursue a career in the workplace cannot do that in a safe environment if she's subject to that kind of misbehavior. And there has to be a remedy. And there can't be a remedy without deciding what happened. We can't allow a woman or a man to say, ""This person's sexually harassing me, so get rid of him."" We can't just -- and this is where I part company with our opponents. I totally am unable to understand how they can say that schools can take action and impose remedies without deciding whether the allegations ever happened or not. I think it's crucial to remember that the objectives of these two different systems are different. First of all, the colleges are responsible, unless you want to say that -- repeal Title IX. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - 9/17/2015 Colleges are responsible for protecting racial minorities and women from sexual and racial harassment. And that includes not only things that are crimes. You could have a student who's receiving hateful email with the ""n"" word. And the colleges have to find out who did that and take some measures. It's not a crime. But they do have a responsibility to preserve an equal educational opportunity for all their women and minorities on campus. So, that's the objective. And the system is remedial. It's not punitive. The colleges' responsibility is to decide, by a preponderance of the evidence -- which is the standard that we use throughout the legal system for anything other than incarceration. Decide whether the person did what's alleged and then take remedial action to protect the victim. Usually involves some sort of separation. That is not criminal punishment. It's not incarceration. It's not a lifetime public record. It's not sex offender registration and so on. So, those things need to be taken to protect the woman's opportunity to get her -- to major in chemistry, to complete her class, and to get her degree. It's -- that's how we reconcile the fact. And it's the same reason why someone who sues for damages is heard in a different environment from somebody who's claiming to be the victim of a crime.",2.0
for,"Well, thanks for that great question. As you can guess, my answer is going to be the courts. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 Arlington, VA 22203 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - 9/17/2015 Because it is very hard to deter people from serious crimes if you slap them on the wrist for doing it. And being told to write a paper or even a suspension, that's a slap on the wrist. Now, expulsion is a serious penalty. But if you keep that a secret, and it's nontransparent, that is not the way you deter sexual assault. I got to add one little point about a previous statement. The burden of proof that the government has forced us to use -- us colleges to use -- preponderance of the evidence -- look, at Yale, what's our standard of proof for a plagiarism case? It's clear and convincing evidence. That, legally - - for those of you who know, that's a standard up from preponderance of the evidence. That's what we do with all our cases. Now, with rape, we're forced to use a lower one. I got to say one more thing -- mediation. You have to understand -- this goes to the workrelated question before. Title IX has forced us to not do -- we're barred from doing mediation. What would grown-ups do with a groping allegation, grown-ups at a school? They bring the parties in, get them to agree. ""You're not going to do this anymore. You agree.  If you break this agreement, you will be subject to penalties."" They agree. That's called mediation.  We can't do that anymore because Title IX -- --",2.0

And deterrence -- Deterrence is one of the goals of the criminal justice system -- deterrence, incapacitation, retribution. We're all criminal law professors up here, so you could -- we could all talk about that. So the criminal justice system is designed to deter, generally. I think the goals of the campus adjudicatory system are very different. And I don't think they have the goal of large, general deterrents. I think they have the goal of individual assessment of the facts and trying to match a remedy that fits whatever happened.

for,"I think that they can get safety through -- if we didn't have these tribunals, they would have safety through the school's reasonable measures that they could take, that they take all the time. They take them even without going through the tribunals. They just impose them, depending on their individualized assessment of what the safety of the campus requires. That does not mean what we need is a system, a shadow justice system that is operating in schools. And so there are many options for schools to undertake to provide for victim support. And they could be even doing a better job if they weren't so focused on this quasi punitive system.",2.0
against,"Yes, I think that question really goes to the heart of one major difficulty with the proponent's position. Many, many victims do not want to force the case into the criminal process. It's not that they -- they think a slap on the wrist is better. But, you know, they have a classmate who's immature, who's just kind of boorish. They don't want to ruin that person's life, but they want protection. And the criminal justice system is a sledgehammer. Let's not kid ourselves. This is no joke. We're not talking about going from a slap on the wrist to, I don't know, a pinch on the cheek or something like that. We're talking about going from a slap on the wrist to a sledgehammer. We're talking about ruining -- literally, not just expulsion, but sex offender registration the rest of the person's life. And many victims, not only do they not want to put themselves through that process, which is one reason why they wouldn't report, but they also don't want to put their classmate through that process, so they won't report.

And the threat is hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding. So you have the threat which applies to all of them. You have 50 schools under investigation. And I can tell you from personal experience that the administrators, the deans, the Title IX coordinators are very, very afraid of being found liable by the Department of Education, by the Office of Civil Rights. And if you talk to them, you will hear this fear expressed all the time.",2.0

I think there's absolutely no question that you get more justice and better results if victims have options and if society itself has a mix of remedies and a mix of ways to responding more moderately or more severely, depending on all the circumstances.

for," Many of you probably remember the case I'm about to mention to you, the Duke Lacrosse case. That was when a woman accused three lacrosse players falsely, it turned out, of raping her at a house party. What was the university reaction to those false rape accusations? It was panic. The coach was immediately fired.  Everyone called for the expulsion of the accused students.  All around the country there was a rush to judgment, a presumption of guilt. Television legal commentator, Nancy Grace, vilified those who even considered the possibility that a woman might lie about being a victim of gang rape. The local prosecutor, too, was taken in. It took the police and the courts and due process to prove that the rape accusation was a fabrication. How did we find out it was false? We found out because the toxicology and forensic evidence disproved the accuser's claims. We found out because there was transparency and professional evidence gathering and procedural fairness. Had the accuser reported only to school authorities, and had that case been tried on campus behind closed doors, it's a good bet that those lacrosse players would have been promptly expelled and had their lives ruined with no way to vindicate themselves. But that case happened in 2007 before all this stuff got going, so that's not what happened. Students were lucky. Their case went to court. Now, I'm not saying that such cases happen every day. And I'm not saying our courts are perfect or our police are perfect. We've got to do better. We have to encourage these cases to go to court through the police to get justice.

We have to be diverting cases away from the criminal law. And that's especially true of sex offenses because even a misdemeanor contact offense means sanctions that are much, much too harsh and much too inflexible. So I remember vividly my children aren't in college anymore but I remember the feelings that I had as a parent when they were. Nobody wants to get a call from a daughter saying she's been sexually assaulted. Nobody wants to get a call from a son saying he's been accused of sexual assault. But, God forbid, if you did get a call like that from your daughter, wouldn't you want her to have options for redress on campus? Would you really prefer her to say that her only option was either to go to the police or drop out of school? That's not even a close question. Limiting her to the criminal courts makes a terrible situation many times worse. And what if your son called to say he'd been unfairly accused? Any parent would dread getting that call, but if it happens, which call would be more horrible? Your son might say, ""Mom, I've been accused of sexual assault, and I might even get expelled or suspended from school."" That's a nightmare. But would you prefer to hear your son say, ""Mom, the DA down here is prosecuting me for rape""? If that's what you would prefer, you should vote for this resolution, but any parent who knows the criminal justice system knows that they -- taking a campus tribunal and the risk of possible campus sanctions, they would take that in a heartbeat.
