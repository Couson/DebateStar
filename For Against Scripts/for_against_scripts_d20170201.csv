That's the system. That's what democracy means. Gayle Trotter. Hi, John. Well, no, because I took note that Hillary Clinton won fewer votes in 2016 than Barack Obama won in 2012.

for,"Thank you all for joining us tonight for this very important discussion. My partner Clive and I ask you to vote in favor of our motion, to give Trump a chance. The question before us tonight requires your focused attention. Let's talk for a moment about what we're not debating. The question is not whether you personally voted for Donald Trump. This being Washington, D.C., I suspect if we ask for a show of hands most of the people in this room would've voted for Hillary Clinton. Nor is the question would you vote for Trump if the election were held today. For the same reason, I am confident of the answer to that question as well. Nor is the question whether you like the electoral college system or would change that system if you could do so tonight. The same answer for the same reason. Nor is the question whether you think that Donald Trump should be president right now. The fact is, that he is the current occupant of the Oval Office. Nor is the question whether you personally like Trump or his temperament or even if you think he's an admirable person. The question is not, do you like Trump? Given the sense of most of the people inside the beltway, that question here is also moot before we even begin tonight. The motion before you and the question we consider tonight is whether to give Trump a chance. Barack Obama insisted on getting a chance as a newly elected president. ""Elections have consequences,"" he said. ""I won."" Giving Trump a chance simply means that we acknowledge what President Obama himself said, that elections have consequences, Trump won, and we can and we should be clear-eyed and realistic about the fact that Donald Trump is president. Giving Trump a chance does not mean endorsing his stylistic approach or approving his policy initiatives, although we will be talking about his policies. Giving Trump a chance does not necessarily mean that you want his policies to succeed. Giving Trump a chance simply means that you're open-minded enough to allow the new administration to do its job and to succeed or fail on its own terms. Ironically, the failure to give Trump a chance has largely fueled his success. Overtly adversarial media, over-hyped predictions of calamity reflect -- reflexive comparisons to autocracy, dictatorship, Watergate, Nazi Germany, these over-the-top criticisms detract from the credibility of his critics and they reinforce Trump's popularity with those who elected him. My partner Clive is not a Trump supporter, yet he can see why we all should give Trump a Chance. In a few minutes, he's going to share his reasons why. Now, the premise of this debate is wrong. It's unlikely that our gracious hosts, Intelligence Squared, would've hosted this debate if Hillary Clinton had won the election. We did not have this debate when Barack Obama won the election and was re-elected. For those who don't understand why many Americans want to give Trump a chance, let me share with you why I think that he will be a good president. Remember, you don't have to agree with me that he will be a good president in order to see why we should give him a chance. We're only asking you to support the tiniest of propositions, the tiniest of propositions to merely give him a chance. Now, Donald Trump has up-ended the established order of politics, media, and culture in America. I would say he poses an existential threat to the media and government's coziness. He may not have the marital history of most Republicans who typically appeal to mainstream Republicans and conservatives. Their surreptitious and well-timed release of the Access Hollywood secret audio certainly did not endear him to chivalrous men and women who care about respect and propriety. What does that say about his success? He was able to overcome these character flaws because he tapped into the issues and the patriotism of his fellow Americans. Where we had previously selected presidents from the ranks of the political elite, the voters decided to choose from outside of those ranks. In essence, Trump's election stands as a rebuke to the political class. I'm not enthralled with everything that escapes President Trump's lips, yet, I, like the millions who voted for him, became a supporter because of three reasons: his experience, some of his personal characteristics, and his policy positions. President Trump has the experience of a successful businessman with a large part of his success based in the United States. He is not a politician and has never before been elected to political office. Just let that sink in. He has never held elected office before being elected as our president. President Trump's personal characteristics appeal to me. He is patriotic. He is plainspoken. No one would accuse him of being politically correct. He is empathetic to struggling Americans. Going out to Dover Air Force Base today when the body of our fallen Seal came back, shows his empathetic nature, especially to military families. President Trump won't bow to the media. He can bypass the media and speak directly to fellow Americans. This is especially appealing to conservatives like me, who see their views mocked and deliberately mischaracterized by the media. Trump has clear views. He's a family man -- with a complicated family, like many of us have. He doesn't pretend to be something he's not. His religious participation mirrors that of many Americans. He appreciates what Larry Alex Taunton calls, ""The grace effect of the Judeo-Christian heritage,"" even if he only loosely engages in religious participation. Trump is not part of the bicoastal elites. He has thick skin. He does not mind criticism, and he punches back twice as hard. Trump understands how to build a leadership team. He is project-oriented. He's 70 years old. He's not focused on enriching himself. He's not made a lifetime of saying one thing and doing something else. He isn't using the government to enrich himself and his family. He desegregated his club in Florida -- -- he has advanced women in his businesses. He doesn't demean women in the workplace by only seeing them as their gender. Instead, he sees them as what they can accomplish and asks them to reach for excellence as he himself does. Trump is not a committed Republican, and that appeals to us -- those of us who are fed up with establishment Republicans who run on conservative principles to beat -- to get elected, and then once they come to the swamp of D.C., they abandon all of those principles. Trump is not bound by ideological consistency, right? Instead, he asks, ""What will work?""",nan
against,"Tonight's proposition is one to which it would seem impossible to say no. It appeals to the fair-mindedness in all of us. We want to give everyone a chance. And it appeals to the realist in all of us. Donald Trump is the president -- the occupant of the Oval Office -- as Gayle Trotter said. And we, of course, hope for the best. True. He did arrive in the Oval Office after a career as the primary publicist for the racist lie that Barack Obama was not an American citizen, and true, his business career is built on crookedness, and deception, and fraud. And true, he does have a history of violent abuse with people and he does see women as something more than people who are distinguished for their talents. And true, he was helped into the presidency by the clandestine operations of the Russian secret police. But after all, people do grow in office. So, we want to withhold judgment, if we can, but the core premise of this motion -- and this is the premise my partner Michael Waldman and I will call on you to reject. The core premise is that the things that we need to know about Donald Trump lie in the future and not in the past -- that we do not yet have sufficient information to form a judgment, but we do. And that is what we will show to you tonight. We know enough to know what to prepare for. And the action of asking you to withhold your judgment is an action that asks you to waste time in uncertainty when it is time to act, to stormproof the Republic and the Constitution against the most dangerous occupant of the office in American history. Donald Trump lies a lot. But, to give him credit, he never lies about himself. He has shown the country who he is and what he is and what he stands for and what he will do. And these are the things -- some of the things that we already know. We know that he has already decided to run the least ethical and transparent administration in the modern history of the presidency, and I would say in the history of the presidency period. And those decisions are not in the future, but in the past. He has already decided you will not see his tax returns. He has already decided that he will not put his assets in a blind trust and he will not separate himself from his business interests. He has already decided that people who want access to the Trump family will get it if they pay. He has already decided to charge Mar a Lago visitors or users to double their entry fee to give them a chance for $200,000 instead of $100,000 to have a few minutes with the next president of the United States. He has already -- he has already brought -- violated his first pledge to separate his sons from his business. They are mingling with senators. They are mingling with senators at the -- in ceremony to welcome the new justice of -- nominee to the justice of the Supreme Court. So, we know that, it will be unethical. That's a fact. You know that now. The second thing we know is that Donald Trump intends to run an administration that will attack fundamental American liberties. Gayle Trotter said it best. Donald Trump does pose an existential threat to what she called the media, and what I would call the free media. He rejects the very concept of such a thing. The reason he -- and not only he but those around him lie so much about everything, about documentable facts, about how many people are in the Washington Mall -- many great presidents had less attendance at their inaugurations than Barack Obama. It's no slight to John F. Kennedy that he had a lesser turnout than John -- than Barack Obama, that Ronald Reagan did. They went on, each of them, to win places in the hearts of the American people. Turnout isn't everything. The reason he tells these lies -- partly it's for his own ego, but partly it is to discredit the very concept of truth. And that is the foundation, as Gerald Ford said, ""Truth is the fundamental proposition on which democracy rests."" We have all -- And we have already seen his attempt to create a state media in all but name which his preferential treatment of not only Fox, but Breitbart and Infowars next, which is soon to be accredited in the White House Briefing Room. Most importantly from my point of view, because I do speak as a Republican and as a conservative, we have already seen -- it is already a fact that he represents the gravest challenge to the western security system of any occupant of this office. He has already said that he may or may not honor America's commitment to its NATO allies under Article 5. Having said that, you can never unsay that, that knowledge, that something that was certain is now uncertain. The biggest journey in logic, and that is the journey from zero to one, the chance of the United States not honoring its obligation to its friends was zero. Now it's one. Now it exists. Before, it didn't. And that you cannot take away. Nor can you take away -- nor can you take away the ever more sickening stink of the mysterious, but doubt -- but dangerous connection and possible collusion between this administration and the government of Russia. We don't know what that arrangement is. There's much about it we don't know. But while there are many secrets, there are no mysteries. We understand that something is terribly wrong. And we know this administration will not allow us to get to the bottom of it. But that's the job we have to do. We have to get to the bottom of that. We -- the call now is not to ponder or to deliberate or to wait on events. The call now is to say, ""What are the actions that we as citizens have to take to defend free institutions, to defend the traditions of American government, to defend free media, to send -- to reassure America's friends around the world, that the word of the United States government is still good despite the present occupant of the office. That's our job. Don't waste time. And that is why we ask you to reject the motion tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. You know, Clive and Gayle both have eloquently asked us to suspend judgment, to suspend what we see with our own eyes, what we hear with our own ears, to turn our minds away from what we see unfolding in front of us. My colleague, David Frum, and I suggest that that is not the wise course for the country. Now I'll admit that when the topic was chosen before the inauguration, should we give him a chance, I was happy to be invited to participate in this, but a little nervous about the topic, because what could be more sensible than giving someone a chance? It sounds so wholesome and American. And I care about the presidency. I care about our system working. I've lived through changes in administration and some of them I like and some of them I don't like, but I believe this is different. This is not a normal presidency and this is no ordinary time. As you know, David Frum and I come to this through different paths. He is a proud conservative. I am a proud progressive. But we both believe, and I think millions of Americans passionately believe that we need to stand up to the potential abuse, to the potential threats to the Constitution, to the potential extremism of this administration and this president of a kind that we have not seen in this country in years if ever. The fabric of our democracy is stretched thin in some very basic ways. So, give him a chance. I mean, in a sense I would say we've already given him a chance. So, put aside, put aside the ugly divisive campaign. Please, put it aside. Put aside the fact, as David said, that a hostile foreign power intervened in our election to help elect Donald Trump. Put aside the fact that he entered office the least popular president since the invention of polls having, among other things, lost the popular vote. Put all that aside. Let's only look at what he's actually done since being sworn in. It seems like a million or two years ago; it was 10 days ago. I know I'm not the only one who wonders how any of us are going to be able to keep this up over four years. Put all that aside. Did he scramble the decks? Did he reach out? Did he come up with some new ideological firmament that would reach out to the Democrats? We all know what's happened. No president in a century has installed an administration this extreme. A chief strategist who previously ran a white nationalist website, a national security advisor who peddles conspiracy theories and who said Islam is ""a cancer,"" an attorney general nominee so far on the fringe that the Senate controlled by the Republican party rejected Jeff Sessions for judgeship because of racial insensitivity. No president in this century or last has posed this kind of threat to civil rights and civil liberties. Just days in, the president of the United States, who swore to uphold the Constitution, started peddling the nonsensical argument that there were three million illegal votes in this country. This is not some random guy on the internet. This is the President of the United States. And think about how absurd that is. Three million votes, not 50 years ago, not 25 years ago -- two months ago -- and nobody noticed. Not the Republican Party, not Fox News. Nobody noticed. But the president is insisting he's launching an investigation which will likely be a witch hunt, and he's promising legislation to come out of it. And what could go wrong with that? And no president in the beginning of his administration has provoked a constitutional crisis one week in. We all know, because we've been living through it, that the President’s hastily drafted an executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries -- has provoked a crisis in so many different ways. The order was a travesty. It was basically a Tweet turned into an executive order. Four federal judges blocked it one week in. He had to fire the acting Attorney General of the United States, who properly and correctly pointed out that the law was illegal, one week in. Again, folks, this is not a matter of projecting in the future. This has happened in front of our appalled eyes all within the last 10 days. There are so many things to be concerned about. It is the case that Clive has written eloquently about what a fiasco the president has made of his first 10 days in office. I will do him -- I don't need to quote it. I will only say that given the things you've said, I want to tell you that we welcome refugees. We're happy to have you come over to our side. That's the spirit we need. In the last day -- -- in the last day, the President has backed off on his pledge to do something about drug prices. He's backed off on many of his things. And if you really believe there's going to be a genuine infrastructure bill worked out with the Democrats, I have some infrastructure to sell you in Brooklyn, because I don't think it's going to happen. For all those reasons and there are many in which of course I think the potential consequences of policies are wrong -- we say and we ask you to say stand up, take advantage of our role in -- as a democracy -- as citizens. Say no to abuse and do not give President Trump an untrammeled chance to trash our institutions, or the Constitution, or the law. Thank you.",1.0
for,"Right, but I think -- -- he's putting out there that it's the fabric of our -- the fabric of our culture is being torn apart because this president is different. So, I think my response goes to the very core of their argument because, if they're saying he's different, they have to prove that he's different than the other president.",2.0
against,"I argued in the affirmative resolve, ""Barack Obama is a Failed President."" I voted against him twice and would do it again. So, I -- but -- We're -- I -- Exactly. So, I thought Barack Obama was an unsuccessful president. I thought he was an admirable man and I understood why people gave -- put hope in him and he was also someone who profoundly proved he was willing to do business with people. You might not like the deal he was offering, but you could -- he was a reasonable person. You could talk to him. You could do business with him. I sometimes wish the Republicans had accepted some of those propositions -- Let me -- the core argument -- here's the core argument of the other side. They allowed -- there is -- at some point before voting day, 2020, where you're allowed to conclude that Donald Trump is dangerous, is it two weeks out, three weeks out, four weeks out? How much stealing is too much? How many attacks on free press are one attack on the free press too many? And how many allies are you allowed to betray and how many -- how many trade arrangements are you allowed to blow up before we say, ""You are an attack on global leadership?"" And our argument would be, ""You already know all of those things."" Now, I'm not saying -- if Gayle Trotter approves of what Donald Trump has done, God bless her. It's a free country still. Let her approve. But do not ask us not to know what we know. That is what the affirmative side is asking -- -- not to know what you already know.",2.0
for,"I think there's a huge disconnect in this argument. David, you said before that we are asking people to suspend judgment. That's not quite right. We're asking people to keep an open mind about what comes next. Don't suspend judgment about what he's already done. I agree with a great deal of what you two have said about what he's already done -- about what he's already said. But he's there now. What I want to know from you is, ""What purpose is served, by saying, by resolving and agreeing not to give him a chance?"" Think about the message that sends to the people who voted for him and ask whether it's likely to impress them. Ask whether it's likely to persuade them to change their minds which is what you should be aiming to do. That isn't the question.",2.0

I just reject the idea that the only person with a democratic mandate happens to be the President. Those who were opposed to him who were elected also have a mandate. The practical effect of the, ""Give him a chance,"" question -- here's a practical question before us, ""Shall we have an independent commission with subpoena power to find out what the Russians did in the American election? Yes, or no? Shall we know the truth to that question?"" I think it's a pretty important question. Now, the practical effect of saying, ""Give him a chance,"" is to say, ""We will never know the answer to that question,"" or, at any rate, ""We'll leave it to the historians long after the administrations gone."" I need to know that now. I need to know it now and our allies need to know it now. Are they safe in America's hands? Are our friends in Estonia safe? We've given our word. We promised to go to nuclear war to defend them. We need to know who and in what interest is that nuclear button controlled? We need to know that. The give him a chance question says, ""You will not know that."" We need to know what this president is right now, actively taking bribes from all over the planet. We need to know that now. It's going on, I believe, now. We need to know if that's true. But what -- the question, ""Give him a chance,"" are you going to be able to find that out?

That's what it says in so many words. They're printed and put on the internet for all to read, and that -- but the risks are real. The risks are not always the same. The risks to liberty in the 2010s are not one in the same as the risks to liberty in the 1930s. That doesn't mean they don't exist as people in de-democratizing countries like the Philippines, like Hungary, like Poland, like South Africa can tell you. They know what Donald Trump is. They have seen it before and when he says the press is the opposition, I quote a journalist from South Africa who's warned American journalists, get ready for a president who's going -- Donald Trump does not want to fight Democrats. Barack Obama is 20 points more popular than he is. He wants to fight the media, but the media is indispensable. It's not an existential threat.

I mean, for heaven's sake, get real. Look at the -- pick up the New York Times. Pick up the Washington Post. The press is -- it's doing its job. I actually think the mainstream press has made a mistake in announcing that the normal rules don't apply to Trump, because I think that tells Trump supporters they no longer need to worry about what the New York Times might think or about Washington Post might think, because those papers have declared they're no longer being neutral, but just don't tell me that the press is cowed, that the press is afraid of Trump. I strongly encourage people to do exactly that. Pick up the Washington Post and pick up the New York Times. News organizations are doing the job of digging up facts that the people in power, not just stray people yelling on the internet, but the people with the power of the federal government do not want the rest of us to know.

I, by the way, don't agree with that decision. I wrote about why I thought Twitter was mistaken -- but it was their website. They didn't have to host them, and they suspended the accounts. Donald Trump soon after -- and I heard from people in the Trump campaign how outraged the Trump campaign people were and how they're -- because some of these people were quite close to the Trump campaign, and they were thinking about what they could do. Should there be anti-trust actions or some other measures? Shortly after the election, the -- Donald Trump had a meeting with tech executives. Twitter was pointedly not included. Donald Trump's favorite social media platform. All the accounts were immediately reinstated and given a checkmark.

And so, even if you don't agree with any of Donald Trump's policies, the fact that he would be able to speak out for people to have the platform, to have the ability, to have the same access, to stand on a soapbox and say what they want to say -- that's a good thing, and we all should support that. Can I -- First of all, I think it's a very interesting question. But, before I answer it, I want to say I don't think it's a terribly relevant question, all right? Because, if it's any point in the future, I think you owe us your vote. If it isn't now that we say, ""Don't give him a chance,"" if it's sometime in the future when something else happens, you owe us your vote. But I'll try to answer the question nonetheless. If he does something impeachable, then he should be impeached. You know, if he breaks the law, he should be held to account. A lot -- a lot of what I think differentiates our position from the other side is that we have -- we appear to have more trust in the Constitution. I believe in these checks and balances. I think American democracy is strong. I think the press is uncalled. I mean, it's actually -- they're extreme. The press is rabidly hostile to Trump. And I think you could argue that's a good thing. I think it's slightly counterproductive, as I mentioned at the beginning, because I think it enflames his supporters. But the fact is the checks and balances of the system -- they're working. They're already working. The civil service is resisting. Judges are ruling against him. And Trump -- what can Trump do? He is bound by the law. Now, if a point comes where he says, ""I'm not interested in what that court says. I'm not interested in the fact that the Supreme Court has said I can't do this. I'm going to do it anyway,"" then you're talking about high crimes and misdemeanors and we don't need to wait for the next election. But if it falls short of that, then I say, ""Yes, give him a chance until the next election."" And, with any luck, if Trump's opponents play their cards right, Trump won't win the next election.",2.0

These are real challenges, not only to the laws, not only to the constitution, but to the norms of how our democracy and how our system have to work. And, you know, again, the question of, ""Give a chance,"" is really a question for those of us who are troubled. When -- how do we respond? I think that people respond rightly when they take very seriously what's happening whether it's on health care or on these legal issues or on other things and are as energized as they are right now.",2.0

I'll just say briefly I think the Trump Cabinet, at least its senior positions looks relatively normal. It's a little forward in that normally administrations say one billionaire to a Cabinet. A half dozen is typically considered excessive. But the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State would not have been my first -- these are very competent and capable people. I think the Cabinet on the whole, especially the senior national security positions reasonably reassuring. The White House is the cantina from Star Wars.

And we've seen that Barack Obama's strategy of leading from behind has made a complete conflagration of the Middle East. And so the fact, I would say, that this is definitely true that, if you look at the people, the men and women that he selected to put into this administration, people of expertise and areas that he does not have in foreign policy and military strategy, I think that that should encourage you when thinking about our proposition here to give Trump a chance that you're right, it's not just Trump it is also his administrative team and that should just I think give more comfort to everyone that he has picked people who are proven patriots, proven leaders and men and women who have decided to sacrifice -- put their lives on the line for America, for American people, and that should only inspire more confidence in --",2.0

Donald Trump will remain president and his cabinet nominees will continue to operate the government. As Clive Crook says, if they break the law, things will happen. If they -- but the risk from this presidency is the things that -- a lot of the things that we're afraid of are not actually illegal. You know, in American law, it's very hard to convince a politician, for example, of taking a bribe and since the Governor McDonnell case in 2014, it's become pretty much impossible. Politicians don't take bribes because they think it's wrong. What if you have a politician who doesn't think it's wrong? The check on the president -- presidents are not supposed to operate like criminal defense lawyers, like go at -- like Saul Goodman from ""Breaking Bad,"" saying, “At what point will the police arrest me and the courts convict me.” They're supposed to act with a bigger ethical compass and you need to be ready, because it's -- the president is already selling access to his office.

Richard Nixon was forced to resign under threats of impeachment. Bill Clinton was actually impeached, though not convicted by the Senate. This is a real factor in the calculation, as I said before. The question is, how far do you trust the Constitution. The checks and balances are there, and I don't see that we need to be quite so alarmed as the other side in this debate, so alarmed, in fact, that we have to tell Trump supporters we aren't interested in anything he has to say or anything he might do because our minds are made up and that's that.",2.0

But you're not deplorable. But that isn't the point. The point is, what do we say? What does this audience say to the close to half of the electorate that voted for Trump? Are we so disgusted by your choice, so appalled by your choice that we're refusing to have anything to do with your candidate -- that that's that? That we will oppose him by any means necessary. Now, I think that's wrong, even though I'm not willing to assume he's acting in good faith. I think, actually, he has lied. In other words, I do suspect him of, you know, uttering intentional falsehoods. That doesn't incline me to say the guy should not be given a chance.

for,"David, I think we have really uncovered a crucial point that we need to flesh out a little bit here. I believe that when you and Michael take this position, that we should not give Trump a chance, even though you're unwilling to pick up arms, and march to the White House, and violently oppose his leadership, there are people who will listen to this debate and will listen, not only to this debate, but to the larger conversation of whether this duly-elected president should even be given a chance to fulfill his constitutional role. And they will take action against it. We can give up on democracy and say it no longer works. And I think David's argument comes very close to that. Or we can agree that something has gone wrong and ask how to fix it. The common factor in the U.S. and Britain and in France and in the Netherlands and in Germany, wherever populism is on the rise, is a political establishment that is ignored or disdained, a large segment of the population. Certainly, the populist draws support from racists and extremists. But don't tell me that all the people who voted for Trump or all the people who voted for Brexit are stupid or vicious and unfit to vote. Recognizing the legitimate concerns of Trump and Brexit supporters is the key to winning them round to normal politics. That doesn't mean pandering to them, but it sure doesn't mean insulting them. The British equivalent of, ""Give Trump no chance,"" is, ""Ignore the referendum."" So, I think that truly, when you get down to the very basic level of this discussion, it is fine to be sitting here and having an academic debate about this. But you talk about Melania Trump, and Donald Trump, and this and that -- inciting people to violence.

The big question is -- we -- I take seriously the voters on all sides seriously enough to debate the issues, to fight hard on the issues, and not just to say, ""Well, the election is over.

It's as bitterly divided as the U.S. is over Trump. And I think the parallel is very close. Brexit supporters did a reckless thing, something they may come to regret, partly out of a sense of desperation. And I think we're seeing exactly the same dynamic play out in each case. The more that argument is pressed, the more resentful that half or close to half of the population will become and the happier Trump and his friend Nigel Farage will be.

And when they insist on shifting the topic away from the question at hand, which is, ""Should you trust Donald Trump,"" to another question entirely which is, ""What do we do about the problems of people that have been left behind by globalization?"" I speak as someone who actually is probably more sympathetic to many of the things that Donald Trump purports to want to do than Clive Crook is. That is not the question tonight. The question is, ""Give Donald Trump a chance or no?"" One of my predecessors at The Atlantic, years ago, coined the phrase about the American constitution, called it a machine that would go of itself. But he coined that phrase to argue against the motion. It's not a machine. It's not a mechanism. This phrase, ""checks and balances,"" that you hear, there's no mechanism. There are no checks. There are no balances. There are only people. There are only people meeting their responsibilities as citizens or failing to meet their responsibilities as citizens. People viewing with a watchful eye, using their judgment, reading media critically or people believing lies and being misled by lies and turning on institutions that are crucial to a free society like a free press. The proponents of this argument of -- the proponents of this debate again and again are urging you not to know what you already know. Not to take action based on that knowledge, not to be a citizen, to be a passive consumer, to wait until the president has committed a high crime and misdemeanor. Then you may act. Until then, stay home, watch the Kardashians, leave the power to the powerful. We reject that idea. Be citizens now before it is dangerous, when you have warning, when you understand the risks at hand. Be citizens now and vote -- and I therefore reject the motion.

Two days prior, I had testified before the United States senate judiciary committee about gun violence in America. The hearing took place about a month and a half after the Newtown shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. I shared with the Senators that guns make women safer and reverse the balance of the power in a violent confrontation. This common sense point is one that most Americans between the coasts and not in Democrat controlled cities understand. I wanted the senators to hear this common sense point before they enacted sweeping restrictions of our civil rights, one right that also might be useful if Trump's critics are right, that he is the second coming of Hitler. In the two days between my testimony and standing on this stage in 2013 for that CNN town hall, I was mocked, I was called vulgar sexist names. I was physically threatened and I was verbally harassed, mostly by strangers, but also by some friends. The New York Times called my ideas dangerous. And my hometown newspaper, the Washington Post, joined the chorus. I know what it is like to not be given a chance, when you stick your neck out because you believe in America and our highest ideals and our precious rights. It's not pleasant.

This is a time that many of us believe is a time of real testing for us, for our generation, the way other American generations have had to be tested before. As you think about this, I want you to try to remember what you thought before the deluge of outrage of alternative facts of Tweets by the President before 6:00 in the morning. Remember what you thought and remember some things, some words the President did not say in his inaugural address. Very unusual to not say these things. He did not talk about the Constitution. He did not talk about liberty. He did not harken back to the values that we were all created equal, from the Declaration of Independence. These are the things that bind us together as Americans, not what we look like, not our religion. And all of us have to every generation renew ourselves to fight for that. And we may not like it. It may feel uncomfortable, but we've got -- all of us, we've got to fight for that now. Like a lot of people who write about this stuff, I find myself rummaging through James Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention quite a bit. And it's really an amazing thing to read. Madison and his fellow framers were really, really worried about a moment like this, about a strong man, about someone like Cromwell. He was worried that we, the people, would become, as he said, tools of opulence and ambition. They warned us. When Ben Franklin left that last day, he went out and a woman asked him, ""Well, what is it, Doctor Franklin, a monarchy or a Republic?"" He said, ""A republic, madam, if you can keep it.""
