for,"Amazon is the reader's friend . In the long -term obviously readers are only going to thrive in a world where author's also thrive and I suspect we're going to spend a lot of time eventually talking about the impact, the long -run impact of Amazon on authors and authorship. And my partner is going to be able to speak to a lot of that in a great deal of detai l, more depth than I possibly can. But I write about economics. I'm a pretty literal person . So, I’m going to keep it a little bit on the surface level -- Amazon is the Reader's Friend . And I think you can see that Amazon is the reader's f riend, by just asking, why are we debating this at all? Why is this a subject of controversy ? It's a subject of controversy because Amazon is really big. It's a big company . It's a powerful company . They have 41 percent of all books sold -- I saw a statistic from last March -- and 67 percent of all digital books . That's big. That's a big power player. It's worth talking about. And it naturally raises the question, you know, how did the company get so big . How did they have so much market share ? Why are they so dominant ? My argument is, they're so dominant in this space because they're the reader's friend. Who buys books ? It's readers. Amazon sells books to the vast majority of readers because it's good for readers . Another argument -- you know, Frank has written that Amazon is some kind of a monopoly, some kind of an abusive force that's dominating the marketplace, maybe through nefarious means, something like that . Some strategy other than being a reader's frien d. And I think that that's just not true, this idea that Amazon must be stopped by some kind of external force . It doesn't hold up, because the fact of the matter is even though Amazon has an extremely large share of the market, it faces a ton of competition . I don't know about you guys, but I'm the owner of an iPhone . I bet a lot of people in the audience may be -- may be iPhone users . Yes ? No ? Yes . Yes? Matthew Yglesias:Maybe -- maybe some of you have a Google , an Andro id phone, something like that, yeah ? Yeah . So, some people have Smartphone s. It turns out these phones, they're directed -- they're connected directly to digital stores . You can go on iBooks on your iPhone . You can go to the Google Play store on your Android . And you can find “ How Soccer Explains t he World.” You can find -- Frank edited a book called ""Jewish Jocks"" that I've been meaning to check out since I was in a debate in San Francisco with his co -editor . And I actually -- I picked it up on m y phone on the train . You can find -- I'm not sure if it's every Scott Turow novel, but a great deal of them . They're there in the Google store . They're there in the Apple store. These are companies that are competing with Amazon. And they'r e not, like -- these are not small, weak, pathetic, helpless companies, right ? They're actually bigger than Amazon . Amazon is not going to drive Apple out of business. They're not going to drive Google out of business. What they are doing is beating them badly in the electronic book space . They're selling way more books than those companies . So, how is it that they're doing that? Did they do something sneaky ? No . They have a better product, right? You can get Apple, Google on your phone . You get them on your tablet. But it's Amazon who invested in creating the Kindle, which is a digital device that's really meant for reading, you know ? I like to read books sometimes on my iPad . It's fun . But my wife, she's got a Kindle Paperwh ite, and she loves it. And I've been known to borrow it, because it -- it really is a better device for reading books on than what these other companies do . They've also got a superior piece of software . If you download a Kindle book, you can read it on your Kindle, but you can also use the Kindle app on an iPhone, on an Android tablet. You can read it on the Web. Apple and Google, they both want to make more exclusive, more locked -down platforms that don't give you as much flexibility . And that's fine . Different companies have different strategies . But normally, in a market, if you were going to offer an inferior product, you would try to beat your competitors on price . But Apple and Google don't do that either . In fact, Apple tried to team up with book publishers to make prices higher. So, it becomes pretty natural, you know ? Amazon has this market share because they have a better product, a better product than their digital competitors . And if you compare it to the ir brick and mortar competitors, you know, there's no -- there's no competition. It's cheaper to get digital books . It's much more convenient to get digital books . It's much more flexible. You can take them along when you're traveling . And Amazon also h as a store where if you're looking for something -- you know, you put it in there . And if it doesn't exist in a digital form, you can order the paper book, right ? That's really neat . It's a good convenience, because when there's something you want to re ad, you know, you really want to get the text that you want. You don't care as much about the format. The other digital companies don't do that. All of which is you know, it's a long way of getting to the point, but it's to say that Amazon has won its market share the best possible way to win market share . It's by doing a better job, offering a better service at a better price . Long story short, they're the rea der's friend, you know? So, we're debating this in New York City . New York is a great city. I know New York very well . I grew up here . I grew up on 12th Street and University Place, down in the Village . And I remember, when I was a kid, right in the neighborhood, you know, you could go to Broadway . There was a Shakespeare and Company down maybe on 4th Street. There was a Forbidden Planet, which had comic books and specialty sci -fi books . You ha ve the Strand, which is this fantastic used bookstore . We had I think it was the original outlet of Barnes & Noble over a few blocks further north from there . And, of course, you also have here in New York probably the greatest public library system in the world . This is like part of what makes New York an amazing place . But it's important when you're thinking about this issue to not think with these sort of narrow New York blinders on and to recall that you know lots of people live in places that are not as big, places that do not have as many -- did not traditionally have as much diversity in terms of book retailing, where you might be talking about a lengthy drive to one bookstore, a limited selection that's there, a library that, you know, maybe has some capacity to get loans from other plac es, but, again, it had its own kind of constraints . What you hav e in the digital space, it's this vast stockpile, you can get any kind of book you want . You can go get public domain books, download them for free off Amazon . And this is a -- really like an incredible bounty . I think there's a red herring out there that on one side of this debate is people who love Amazon and on the other side of the debate are people who think books are an important cultural artifact. Culture matters . Books are crucial to our society . And that's exactly why it is so important that Amazon has made it cheaper, easier, and more convenient for people all around the country and in a growing number of countries, to access these crucial cultural artifacts. Books aren't widgets . Books matter. And that's why it's so important that you recognize that Amazon truly is the reader's friend and vote for this resolution . Thank you.",
against,"Well, I listened to Matt carefully, and I want to begin with a major concession . He is not totally insane . The -- he is right, of course, about certain things . Amazon charges low prices . Amazon has built a better mousetrap . Their software is great. But that's really not here -- all that we're here to talk about . The question isn't whether Jeff Bezos bears some faint resemblance to Lex Luthor . The question is whether Amazon is the reader's friend . And in defining that -- or I'd like to be a little lawyerly, I'd like to talk about two things and focus on two words . The first, of course, is ""reader's,"" because readers are more than mere consumers . We agree that books are more than widgets . They bear our culture, thought, knowledge with them . And as Frank Foer is going to talk about when he comes to the podium, Amazon is doing great damage to our literary culture . The second word and perhaps one I want to focus on most is the word, ""friend."" ""Friend,"" as we commonly understand the term, means somebody you can rely on to treat your interests as equal to their own. And instead what the record demonstrates is that Amazon is nobody's friend but Amazon's . They are capitalists of a particularly ruthless breed who, in point of fact, have habitually turned on their business allies whenever it meets their business needs . And, in point of fact, Matt, they are beginning to do this now to readers . Matt concedes that Amazon has a huge market share . I don't -- even sort of waving your hands and saying that I don't think does full justice to the magnitude of the power Amazo n currently exerts . They sell three -fourths of the physical books that get sold in this country online . They sell at least that many eB ooks, especially when you count the market that's starting to grow where Joe is -- has been so successful, that is to s ay, ""self-published"" authors . There are parts of the book market that Amazon literally just owns . They have bought up the two largest producers of audio books . They bought the biggest seller of used and rare books, of books sold t o the international market, of print on demand books, of self-published -- physical self -published books, and, of course, they've swallowed up sites like Goo dR eads , or, BookFinder, that might have become competitors to them, another place where reader s could have bought books . Now, to Matt I have to say that anybody who believes that Amazon will use this power only in friendship has not read Lord Acton or Machiavelli. Amazon already pushes books forward on their site at the expense of others for business purposes, or worse, for political purposes, and their tactics vary between the ruthless to the underhanded. Is Amazon being the reader's friend, Matt, when they alter search results in exchange for promotional payments without acknowledgi ng to their readers that they do that? Or consider the subject you talked about, the chokehold that Amazon got on eBooks with the introduction of the Kindle in 2007 . First -- and the only innovation in the Kindle, by the way, was not the device . It wasn't e-ink . All -- it wasn't digital books . All of those had existed . The innovation was when Amazon convinced the publishers to allow digital books, eBooks, to be sold at the same time that hardcovers went on the sale -- went on sale . The publishers agreed, and as soon as they did that, friendly Amazon backstabbed the publishers and began selling eBooks at a loss of $3 to $4 apiece on average . Now, people like to say that Amazon sold eBooks at a loss to promote the sale of the Kindle . Tha t frankly is bologna. If you want to promote Kindles, sell them at a loss . Amazon sold eBooks at a loss for two reasons, to stifle competition -- they wanted to prevent anybody else, competing device makers, places like bookstores, which would've been a great place to buy eBooks -- they wanted to prevent them from going into the market in competition with them . They artificially -- the second thing they did by selling at a loss is they tilted the market away from physical books, the books published by th e publishers who had gone into this business with them, and, of course, in the process, put businesses like Borders, not to mention thousands of bookstores , out of business . And this loss selling was not honest free -market competition on a le vel playing field. It was frankly a mugging sponsored by Wall Street . For 20 years since the company was established, Wall Street has given Amazon unlimited capital, clearly with the expectation that even though the company didn't report a profit, sooner or later they would reap the immense profits that are bound to come from knocking all the competition aside . Then last year, Amazon -- Wall Street finally became concerned . When is this company ever going to make a profit ? The Amazon share price slid by 25 percent, and Amazon reacted by squeezing its suppliers, which is to say publishers and aut hors, and, of course, readers . This is what led to the dispute between Hachette andAmazon where Amazon punished not only the company but also Hachette authors by subverti ng the sale of Hachette books . They disserved authors like Joe, self -published authors, by starting a subscription series that undercut the income of authors like Joe, who's admitted that in print . And finally, of course, Amazon started raising book prices . The compa ny that announced in 2001 it would sell any book over $20 at a 30 percent discount no longer adheres to that practice. All right. Thank you.",1.0
for,"I'm smiling right now -- seriously, what the heck am I doing on this panel ? We've got two journalists on this panel. We've got a lawyer on this panel . We've got a lawyer on this panel who did what all the lawyers wish they could do . He actually saved an innocent man from death row . He did. Okay . That's enough. His head is big enough. Innocent man from death row . These guys went to Harvard . They went to Stanford . T hey went to Columbia University . I went to Columbia College. It is not affiliated . I majored in Budweiser. And you think oh, that's a blow off major, but I still only got a 2.2 GPA. You know what, that may have been a 2.2 blood alcohol level . I couldn't remember the finals at all. I'm telling you . But I am very happy to be up here and I'm going to keep smiling because I really can't believe that I am here . Who's seen the movie ""The Paper Chase ""? It's about a Harvard law student working his butt off, taking classes, studying to actually become a big lawyer, and Scott actually did that. And when I went to school I was in my dorm making a sofa out of empty beer cans . So why am I here ? I don't know why I'm here. Okay, I've sold some books . Okay, I like Amazon. By a show of hands, how many people here have bought something from Amazon ? Okay. That is everybody in the room. By a show of hands, how many people hate raising their hands ? That' s meta. You're going to laugh about that la ter. Let's get on topic here . Scott brought up publishers . Amazon is the big bad guy, but what about these publishers ? Well, you know what ? Publishers are the bad guy and I'm going to tell you why . He said earlier we need publishers for culture, for rich literary culture . That's incorrect . Publishers don't write books . Authors write the books. Authors are the ones who impart this rich literary culture . The publishers are just high- priced middle men, okay ? Let's talk about publishers and all of the books they have rejected. Publishers reject hundreds of books for every one that they publish. Now think about that. That's censorship. It really is . There are thousands of books out there that you have never seen because the guardians of culture, those publishe rs, have never published them . Nine of them were mine . I got more than 500 rejections . Yeah, I know, every time the mailman came I had to pop a Prozac . I eventually did get published after my 10th book and then I learned more about publishers . I learned that publishers charge too much. Scott's new book, which I'm sureis excellent, the publisher nicely printed the price right on the cover, $28.00 for a hardcover. Wow, 28 bucks . If you can't afford that and you're a huge Turow fan you can wait a year and get the cheaper priced paperback. That's called windowing . That doesn't seem like publishers are really friends to readers. They would give them that paperback earlier because the paperback vastly outsells the hardcover. Publishers give out advances . They give an author an advance . Now, I got a nice advance according to Publisher's Weekly, $30, 000 bucks and I was pleased to get it and I felt I was really lucky because the average advance is $5,000 . You're not going to live off $5,000, especially since publishers pay you that over the course of three years . In small payments twice a year, becau se publishers only pay twice a year. It -- a word on advances before I get off that topic, an advance has to be paid back in copies sold, okay ? And it's a very high interest loan. If I self -publish on Amazon, which I have done successfully many times, in fact since I started self- publishing on Amazon, my income went up 20 percent. Oh no wait . That's wrong . It went up 20 times . So it went up 2,000 percent . My best year traditionally published I made 50 grand. Last year I made a million dollars . That's still 50 grand after taxes . What it comes down to is publishers are deciding what you read and what you won't read . They decide how you get it and how much you pay for it and they hav e that much power because they are a cartel. They are a form of monopoly called an oligopoly . The top five publishers control 80 percent of all the print books . As a writer, if I want to get into a bookstore, I have to go through those publishers . And they don't have to pay me anything, because there are 10 guys behind me who want my spot. Amazon looked at this market and they decided publishers weren't reader's friends . So, they innovated. They opened the world's biggest bookstore with the best customer service . They invented the e -book reader that everybody wants, along with the app that everybody wants . They gave all authors a chance to reach readers . So, my nine booksthat sat on a shelf finally go t out there and reached readers . And I guess readers like them, because I sold a million of them . In other words, Amazon looked at all the things publishers were doing wrong and then they did them right. And rather than try to compete, the publishers colluded and price-fixed to raise prices . We'll talk more about that a little later. This debate is not about Amazon being the writer's friend, though. I can give you examples that they are, but that's not what this is about. It's not about Amazon being the publisher's friend . That's not this debate . It's not about Amazon being a monopoly . That's not the debate . It is about Amazon being the reader's friend . Amazon isn't perfect. No person is . No company is . But let me tell you somet hing. If Amazon right now were building a death machine that was fueled by the screams of puppies -- -- it still wouldn't matter because they're still a friend to readers . Thank you.",1.0
against,"Well, I'm feeling real good about the literary future right now . Listening to these guys come out here and talk in such fawning, slavish terms about a corporation . Amazon is a company . They are not -- they are not pursuing the greater good. They're not pursuing cultural greatness . They are a company out to make a bunch of money . They have done this extremely well. They produce things at very low prices . They have technologically innovated all over the place . I use Amazon. You use Amazon. And there isn't anything wrong about that. The problem is this -- it's that they have done it extremely well . And -- and a company can perform at a very high level, and in turn, obtain a monopoly . They can be the only player . Matt says they aren't a monopoly . But when you control 70 percent of a market, that, historically, counts as a monopoly . In the old days, it -- before -- before the Reagan Revolution, before the Chicago School of Economics trashed anti -trust law, our authorities used to get upset when companies controlled 10 percent of any given market. Not 70 percent -- nearly 70 percen t of any given market . But this is different. This is books . This is about our crown intellectual jewels . This is about the thing that we should care most about in the world, because it's about imagination. It's about understanding our past. It's about rooting out people in power . And when you have one company that sits there, and is the chokehold for books, that becomes a problem . It may not be a problem just now, but it will become a problem in the future . And it's something that we, as readers, as citizens, as guardians of the book, need to pay incredibly close attention to . Why do I care about this? Well, when I wrote an article about Amazon in the New Republic, what was their immediate response ? They yanked ads from the New Republic . When it -- they were having the dispute with Hachette, the publishing company -- what did they do ? Well, they punished the guy who wrote the book about the Koch brothers, but they let Paul Ryan's book go unscathed. They didn't punish him. When a company has that chokehold, when they can decide who wins and who loses in the publishing game, we need to be very, very afraid as citizens . So -- -- what is Amazon ? Amazon is the everything store . Their ambitions are boundless . They name themselves after the largest river in the world . They're making Woody Allen movies -- television shows now. They're selling you your underwear, your socks . They want everything . They want nothing else to be abl e to breathe on this planet except for their consumers and the people who make their goods . And so that's a very, very dangerous thing, and we've seen this with publishing . We've seen the way that they've treated book publishers to date . It' s not the worst offenses in the world. They're trying to -- whatever . But it's bad, and it portends bad things . They've thrown around their power in order to try to continually squeeze the publishers . Now, I want to just say something in defense of publishers because they've been trashed considerably tonight, and I have a feeling that a lot of this debate will come down to a referendum on book publishing . Yeah, book publishers suck. They're an oligopoly . They're five big publishers. They're not great, but there are going to be a lot less of them because when companies see one big powerful player who controls their market, their natural instinct is to huddle together in safety and to cower . And that's what's happening now . Penguin merges with Random House . Hachette tries to buy Perseus . And that's going to continue in the face of Amazon, and that's going to continue to just squeeze the diversity out of our intellectual space. Now, what publishers don't do a great job always of picking books, although you have -- when you look at the shelves in your library, you have to say, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Zadie Smith, that they've done a pretty good job of picking winners in the past. But that process of p icking winners is incredibly important . If you go to Amazon's self-publishing page and you look at the self- published authors, there are thousands of them . And I have no idea which one of them to read. I am too lazy as a reader. I don't have enough tim e to go read the first chapters of all these books in order to determine what's good . I look to publishers to see that somebody other than the author's mother thinks that the book is worth reading. So they play an important role -- -- in sifting through the market, which is one great thing that they do . The second thing that they do is that they help authors who are usually introverts and nerds and very bad at self -promotion -- -- bre ak through in the world . And, you know, they don't -- they didn't do that for Joe Konrath ? Well, you know, shame on them . But they do a good job of that for many, many, many other authors . Now, the most important thing that they do -- and Joe is talking about fiction, which is fine . I think it's a different market than nonfiction. Nonfiction books often involve deep reporting , many trips to the archives . They're very, very expensive to produce. You can't just sit up one day and say, ""I' m going to go write a biography of Virginia Woolf."" That's expensive . You got to go travel to England. You've got to -- you've got to photocopy things. You know, and in the way that you are able to finance a project like that is by an advance . They are Kickstarter for authors . They pay authors a little bit of money at the beginning of a project which enables them to compl ete -- to complete that. And I could be wrong here, but I can't even -- I was trying to think if I could think of any self-published nonfiction books that have been successful, any great biographies or histories, and I couldn't do that. And that stuff is going to suffer in this new world. And so I think in this debate, you are readers . Y ou are the defenders of the book . The presumption here should be that anything that is distantly threatening to the book is something that you should be very, very concerned about. Anything that threatens this wonderful intellectual ecosystem that we have, whic h is already imperiled in so many different ways, shapes, and forms, needs defenders . It's your obligation here to step up, to send a message to Amazon, and to defend the book . Thank you.",1.0
against,"So , one of the things that -- t he world of the Internet is a deceptive one . It looks like it's wide open until it's not. But the people who arrive first and establish advantages in that world are the ones who win and win in a major way . It's what happened with Google, it's what happened with Facebook, then it happened with Amazon. They were able to get there first and then build distribution systems, technology . That's very, very hard for other companies to come in and compete with. And so the fact that they've actually produced this product that in some ways is genius for consumers, it's understandable that consumers would flock there, but it also helps explain why they've achieved so much market share . It's very, very hard for anybod y to get into this market and compete with them .

But you see, I mean, venture capitalists in Silicon Valley are, in fact, willing to back online retail competitors to Amazon because they don't think it has the same kind of network effects as a Google or a Facebook . And you also see -- I mean, I said this in my original point, and I haven't heard it addressed, but eBooks are sold by companies that are not Amazon, by well- financed companies called Google and called Apple . Amazon has market share vis -à -vis those companies not because of a nefarious power but because Google and Apple have not brought forth a better product at a better price. And that's unfortunate . I mean, I wish that they cared as much about the book market, but it restrains Amazon's ability to raise prices or squeeze consumers or do any of these other terrible things. Exactly.",2.0

It works as well as Amazon's . I wouldn't say the same thing about Barnes and Noble . But the problem is it's not a book site . There aren't physical books there . They're not a full or a real competitor with Amazon in that sense .

I don't just want to be the publisher, to do business with the publishers and get the most favora ble rates from them, they want to destroy them .

The reason that their commitment to things other than profit -- yes, they are obsessed with profit, but they're also -- they also publish poetry and they publish histories and they publish other things that don't make conventional sense on a balance sheet, because they view their mission as to make money, but also to create and to sustain a book culture .

They d on't offer these advances because they're careless and just throwing money around like drunk morons . And they don't do it as an act of charity . I mean, there is, in fact, philanthropic support for certain kinds of non- profit work. Lots of important non-fiction books are written by professors at universities, et cetera. Et cetera. But book publishers pay advances because it's part of their business model, because as you say, it's required to get the book written. And so, the question is that either makes financial sense or it doesn't, right ? Giving people the advance in exchange for a cut of their sales is either a profitable business to be in -- in which case people will continue to do it in the future -- or else it's not a profitable business to be in, in which case it's goi ng go away -- regardless of what happens with e -books, and whatever else like that . So, I think it's a total red herring . And I think, again, to focus thi s on the question of -- no one is denying that Amazon is not the book publisher's friend. But is it the reader's friend, right? They're squeezing these publishers, but they're doing it -- they're trying to sell books . You sell books to readers .

I keep the gates of what articles go up on the site . And I'm also a writer, and I feel like my writing has always been improved by editing . But you can see when you look, I mean, the world of writing is much bigger than the world of book publishing . And there's lots of different ways in which editing gets done between the final publication of something and the initial conception of it. And so I think when editors are adding value to writers and to readers, which I think they often are, there are ways to make that happen. I think the particul ar way that editing of books happens, the sequence from the writer, to the agent, to the publisher, to the editor who works for the publisher, you know, that is being several challenged by the current dynamic . But anyone who really cares abo ut making their writing better, finds ways to work with editors . And that happens in newspapers, it happens in magazines, it happens in websites, and it'll continue to happen. I love editors, and I have seve ral editors, and they're easy to find . There's a whole group in this country called, ""freelancers,"" and they actually will do editing for a set fee, and that set fee is nice . It's some cost . It's not you paying forever . When you are edited by one of the big five, they own that book for your lifetime plus 70 years .

You can imagine companies that just don't happen to be the existing big five publishing companies doing a similar sort of service, where they look at drafts and when they find drafts that they think are promising, they agree to edit them, work on them, and improve them in exchange for a percentage of the sales . That's not like a crazy business to be in. The book publishing business has worked along that kind of model for a long time . It often is the case when technologies change that the particular incumbent companies lose out, but something sort of similar takes its place . I think that you've seen in the journalism world that I'm in, right, that some old companies have struggled . Some old companies have thrived . Some new companies have come out, but this stuff that's really valuable in terms of like writing, reporting, editing, that still hap pens at all different kinds of places and I think you'll see the same thing in publishing .",2.0
