against," It's my peculiar fate in this debate to be speaking last and therefore to have to digest the statements of the other speakers. I must say this puts me an odd position. I feel a bit like the mosquito in a nudist colony. I'm not sure where to begin. I guess I'll begin by noting that there were two definitions that have been advanced by the other side that actually I think help our case. The first one is the idea that people who have religious beliefs are hypocritical. But notice that in making this accusation what was being alleged is that religious believers have ideals higher than they can live up to. And this is advanced as hypocrisy, in other words, holding up to a standard and falling short of it. Now, that is actually not hypocrisy. If you read the Bible, Jesus doesn't call people hypocrites because their ideals are too high. He calls people hypocrites who pretend to be one thing and are really another. The problem with the Pharisees wasn't that they had high principles, is that they didn't have principles but they pretended to be something they weren't, so we've seen a subtle shift in the meaning of hypocrisy, a shift that is advanced by the atheist side, why? To basically pull down the moral ideals that we hold up that are higher than ourselves. That I would suggest is a very bad thing. Now, Matthew made the argument that religion is a function of where you're born. If you were born in India, you're going to be a Hindu -- actually I was born in India, I was raised Catholic, but never mind -- that your religious identity is formed as a result of where you're born. If you're born in Afghanistan you're a Muslim and so on. Well I think this applies to all our beliefs. Let's say for example that somebody born in Oxford, England is more likely to subscribe to the theory of evolution than someone born in Oxford, Mississippi. Somebody who is born in New York City is more likely to have formed Einstein's theory of relativity than someone born in New Guinea. Now what does that say about whether evolution and relativity are true?  The fact of your birth is irrelevant to the merit of the idea, so there's a kind of sleight of hand here, you have to judge the ideas by their own merits. Now, would the world be better without religion? You can't answer that question without looking to see what religion has done in the world, but you've got to compare it to what the world would be like without religion. There's been some allusion to the boring crimes of religion, but let me suggest that those crimes, even the worst of them, are infinitesimal compared to the crimes ofatheist regimes that are far greater in magnitude, far longer in duration, and actually are still going on. If you consider, for example, a tragedy like the inquisition, a crime, I admit it, and yet over 400 years the Spanish Inquisition killed fewer than 2,000 people, 2,000. The Salem Witch Trials I heard about when I came to America, and then my wife and I a few years ago went to Salem, Massachusetts, it's a really interesting place -- I do want to report, the witches today are doing great, most of them are tourist guides -- but if you pick up one of their brochures, the number of people killed in the Salem Witch Trials, 19, 19. Now, is that 19 too many? Yeah, or if you want to add it up, 2,019. But while the atheists cry inconsolable crocodile tears over the crimes of religion, they ignore the vastly greater crimes of atheism. Now, am I talking about Stalin in Russia and Mao in China? Not even really, that's just the tip of the atheist iceberg. If you dig deeper, there is a massive procession underneath. In the Soviet Union alone, starting with Lenin you continue through Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, a procession of Soviet dictators, but what about Ceausescu and , Fidel Castro, Kim Jong Il, Pol Pot, I mean, Pol Pot is such a junior league atheist people don't even mention him. And yet in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, his Khmer Rouge regime in the space of about three years managed to kill two million people, two million. Even bin Laden in his wildest dreams has not even come close, but who should parachute into the discussion at this critical moment but Richard Dawkins in his book, ""The God Delusion,"" and he goes, ""Wait a minute. We've got to make a crucial distinction here."" You might've had some tyrants who killed -- who happened to be atheist, but they didn't kill in the name of atheism. The Christians killed in the name of Christianity. Now, Richard Dawkins is a respected biologist, and I think here you begin to see the problem, when a biologist is allowed to leave the laboratory.  Because evidently the poor man knows no history, all you have to do is crack open the collected works of Karl Marx, and you will see that the atheism is not incidental, it's not some add on, it's intrinsic to the whole ideological scheme, Marx famously calls religion, the opium, a kind of drug of the masses. And his point is you’ve got to get rid of religion in order to establish the new man and the new Utopia freed from the shackles of traditional religion and traditional morality. Often when we think of secular society, we think of Europe. But Europe isn’t really secular. Europe is a product of 2,000 years of Jewish and Christian civilization. Even today if there’s a famine in Rwanda, while much of the world ignores it, the European countries, the Western countries begin to send to food and aid, Doctors without Borders, the Red Cross. My point is this is the result of a religious training and a religious habit of mind that remains. Nietzsche once said that if we get rid of God, we’ve got to get rid of shadows of God. In other words, the ideas that Judaism and Christianity brought into the West and into the world, those will begin to erode as well. Dostoevsky said a long time ago, “If God is not, everything is permitted.” And Dostoevsky’s point is that when we get rid of transcendence, when we create a world without religion, we license terrible calamities. So, in the names of the thousands and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of souls who have died, I would say from their point of view, the world would have been a lot better off if it had religion. ",1.0
against," Remember, we also get kids early with habits like brushing your teeth, learning the mathematical tables. Now, here is the point. I think that as a practical matter, we all learn our ethical values from our parents. I learned what I would call “crayon Christianity” from my parents. But the fact of the matter is that's my parents' beliefs. When I became a teenager, when I went to Dartmouth, that set of beliefs got battered, and crayon Christianity became no Christianity at all. So it was in adult life that I had to go back to the ideas that had been bred in me as a child and ask, which of my parents' beliefs do I agree with? I do. Well --John Donvan: And brushing your teeth, those are scientific experiments that have determined -- but they're arguing a somewhat different point, that there are lots of people who may not be able to do the critical thinking that you do. Well, I think we're making a deep mistake here because just to say we learned it from our parents misses the thrust of why billions of people in the world continue to do it long into old age. In other words, religion delivers practical benefits. It gives us the hope of life after death. You might say that's an illusion, but you don't know. None of us knows what comes after death. We all have to die in any case. Either we die with despair facing annihilation, or we have the hope of something else. That's a practical benefit. Second, religion is a mode of transmission of morality. You might say there is morality that comes through Kant or Nietzsche or Heidegger. But no one teaches their kids morality that way. People learn their morality --",2.0
for,"Well, I just think it's a distortion of what you actually see in life, which is you see people who grow up in cultures. They become addicted to their particular religions. They disagree with all kinds of other religions. Even you, you started as a Catholic. You end up as an evangelical. Does that mean that you then say the stuff in the Catholic part of it was actually wrong, and you were mistaken about that? I think all of this is frankly delusional and that even if you could remove all of the bad things about religion and keep all of the good things in religion, none of which can't be performed by people who don't believe in God because they can. But even if you could remove all of the bad things from religion, and you ended up with a character who is like Father Christmas, a nice harmless sort of person, would you want to find out that the president of the United States was a devout believer in Father Christmas? Not me.",2.0
against,"So I want to say, first of all, it's so interesting that the side that's quoting the Bible is that side and the side that has actually provided evidence of any kind is this side. So let me give you another piece of evidence as opposed to the generalities. In their Encyclopedia of Wars, okay, the Encyclopedia of Wars, Charles Phillips and Alan Axelrod, they chronicle over 1700 serious conflicts throughout history. Do you want to know what percentage actually reduced to religious wars? Seven percent. The reason I'm saying this is because it's not about credulity. No, it's not about credulity. The idea that people who are religious are religious because of some psychological deficit, but people who are not religious are not religious because they reason their way to the lack of religion, not only slights the idea that religious people are capable of thought, but also tries to sort of railroad into this belief that you should condemn it without actually looking at all the statistics, the ideas, the history that we cited. And that sort of slighting of the religious belief makes me think that your argument might not be as sound as you think it is. A.C. said earlier that the defining feature of religion is hierarchy and exclusivity. And I think that on both these, he's giving a very narrow and ethno-centric definition. First of all, Christianity is the only religion in the world that considers another religion, Judaism, to be wholly true. Hinduism considers all other religions to be wholly true. There's no sense in the Eastern religions of this hierarchy of this exclusivity. So we're seeing here not an attack on religion, but on a very slice of religion, perhaps fundamentalist religion. I think the deeper point here is this: And that is that the religious guy and the nonreligious guy are both responding to the world as it is. Charles Darwin became an atheist not because he discovered evolution. It wasn't facts. It was when his daughter, Annie, died. And Charles Darwin said, ""If there's a hell, lots of the lovely people I know would be in it. I can't bear that kind of a doctrine."" You, Matthew, in your article in Slate magazine talked about nuns or teachers who beat you on theankles and people -- people who stuck their hands down your pants. My point is, in many cases, we're not dealing with facts. We're dealing with wounded theism. Many times when we heard the word ""atheism,"" we're dealing with a person who is angry with God or angry maybe with the representative, the self-appointed representative of God. That's not real atheism. They too are conducting, if you will, an ideological war, otherwise they wouldn't -- -- be here. Well, I didn't put my hand down your pants.",2.0
for,"-- great-great-grandfather-- -- that are simply not true. His atheism didn't come solely from the fact that his daughter died. It was a very slow process of seeing how the theory of evolution was in conflict with the Bible. And I think the point I would make is, let's give the religious people that at some point in history, religion was helpful, that it did make people do better things. But that the texts that the religions are based upon are archaic, absurd, cruel, open to interpretation. And frankly, there are better ways of conducting yourself in life.  And people like myself and Anthony here, we don't find a problem with being moral without God. And I don't buy in argument that we've inherited it from Christianity because if you look at the sort of evolutionary world, empathy and cooperation, compassion clearly existed before God decided, for some unknown reason, .",2.0
against,"I'm not a literalist, no. But what I find very interesting is that the leap that Matthew's making -- he says these texts have cruel things. There are better ways to behalf. But we're asking not would the world be better off if you rewrote the Bible, but would the world be better off without the influence that religion has on religious people. And I tried again and again to say this is what religious people do. This is what religious people do. This is what religious people do only to get back, ""But look at the terrible text."" And I want to say, in response to what Anthony said, I have the exact opposite experience. I actually think that if you believe that people are fundamentally good, and if you leave them alone, they're just going to be good, then you've never visited a playground, because my experience is when a new kid comes to the playground, the other kids don't go, ""Oh, look, a new child. Let us embrace him and share our toys."" Actually, children have to be socialized to good. They do. And it takes a lot of work. If any of you are parents, do you have to tell your kid, ""Don't share so much, don't be so nice."" No, quite the opposite. And that work is difficult work and constant work and that's what religious communities do. Do they ever do harm? Of course they sometimes do harm. Are there texts I don't like? Of course, but the coda to this is, this idea that religious people are thoughtless automatons that follow what the text says, does violence to everything I know aboutreligious training, about religious leaders, about religious people, and by the way about the fact that we're having a debate like this tonight.",2.0

The people I met in Pennsylvania, who 50 percent of them believe in creationism and are fundamentalists, are people -- these people, they ignore. They're saying we ignore their sophistication. I'm saying they ignore the fact that most of the world is fundamentalist and takes a barbaric view of many of the text. Well, the harm is absolutely enormous, I mean, 50 percent -- I mean, just to be practical about it -- 50 percent of the growth of the American economy since World War II has come from science and technology. And this anti-scientism is gradually eroding America's ability to produce enterprising, educated --",2.0
against,"First of all, if you want to make a list of the 200 greatest scientists of all time from Newton, Copernicus, Kepler, Pascal, Gassindi, Boyle, the list goes on, you find that the vast, vast majority of them were religious believers. Moreover, it's not an accident that science did not develop universally. It developed in Western civilization. Why is that? Because in Western civilization, there is an embedded religious idea, and that is the idea of the rational cosmos. The Muslim philosopher Al-Ghazali denies that the universe operates by laws. He says, ""Everything happens because Allah wills it at every given moment,"" that's why science didn't develop in the Muslim world. It's the sense of the whimsical, the miraculous universe. The point I'm trying to get at here is that on the basis of, I would say, a one percent minority of religious rednecks, we have an indictment of all the world's religions as a whole. Nothing could be more crude and shameful than to imply that Athens and Jerusalem which have given rise to Western civilization, that have shaped our philosophy, our economy, separation of powers, checks, and balances, when Thomas Jefferson, who -- Very briefly, Anthony, I think actually you're the victim of a very parochial education because long before Christianity, Judaism enunciated all the ideals that you say did not actually come from religion. In 50 BCE, when Hillel was asked to summarize all of Judaism, he said that which is hateful to you, don't do to others. And the sages of Judaism were killed by the Roman Empire, not be a religious empire, as opposed to Socrates who was killed by the Athenian polity that you idealize. They killed their own sages. In Judaism, we venerated them. And they’re actually the ones who ceded Christianity and gave us the morality that you claim came from the Stoics. I know the story. By the way, actually you also are the victim of an inadequate Biblical education I think because Sodom was not destroyed because of homosexuality. Read the book of Ezekiel. It was destroyed because of the cruelty of the people of Sodom, their immorality, and I really -- I think with all due respect that to cite London cab drivers, pithy though they may be as the demonstration that Judaism didn’t actually create the morality of the West, may be a little thin. A.C. Grayling: the demonstration. And Sodom was destroyed no matter what reason you give to it.",2.0
for,"I don’t think so. There’s lots and lots of people who do good things and organize -- Well, I think the difference is that even the mistakes of people who are acting out of nonreligious motives are mistakes based on reason. And that most of the horrors of religion are mistakes based out of superstitious fear and delusion. And I cannot see how delusion can be healthy to a society. I just can't -- I can't see it. Not all of these religions can be true because they all contradict each other. So some of them are delusional. How can this be healthy? It's divisive. It's nonsensical. And I am not saying that atheism has come up with the perfect solution. But there has to be a better way than this. I think it's secular humanism. It's atheism.",2.0
against,"I mean, the frustration that I repeatedly am having in this debate is that we're arguing theory against the world. The world is that there are millions and millions and millions of people who, by their own testimony, although the other side may not believe it, say they're doing good because they believe there is a transcendent purpose in their doing good. Therefore, they'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. It's not a club that's going to dissolve. They're not going to go away. They're not going to stop doing it. And they're going to teach their children to do it. And what we hear on the other side, to a great extent is, that's bad because it's delusional. And the question is not actually would the world be better off if everybody had the same scientific ideology? Would that be a better world? The world -- the question is, what would it be like if religion were gone? What would it be if you just, all of a sudden, sucked that motivation from these countless people who do good? And that's what I want to know.Matthew Chapman: I'd like to propose an --",2.0

against,"The reason that that's not persuasive, shall we say, is first of all, very few religious people will tell you it's to get into heaven. It's because it's what God expects them to do. That's first of all. In other words, you do it because other human beings are created in the image of God. And if you take that out, then our link is a species link. But if we're all children of the same God, then you are my brother and sister, and that's why you do it. It's different. It's not because you are afraid of God. And second, people's self-reported charitable doings, although obviously everyone here is completely honest. People's self-reported charitable doings are a lot less reliable than survey after survey after survey. And the way that the surveys were answered by Putnam, by Brooks, by Koenig, by respected sociologists, the way that he answered them is by asking you to raise your hand. Now, I want to ask you seriously, how many of you believe that all these sociologists and psychologists are cooking the data, and how many -- you don't have to raise your hand. And how many of you believe that whether you like religion or not, the truth is that it does make people much more inclined to be self-sacrificing in this world. And if you don't believe it, then all I can say is, I know a world without religion that you can look at. I'm from that world. It's called Hollywood.",2.0
for,"Well, I mean, that, to me, is the entire problem. If you look at any religious text, it can be interpreted in any way and give you an excuse to do anything. These gentleman here, I'm sure they're very nice people, and they look at it in the most benign way. I've heard Rabbi Wolpe over there say that the whole process of religion is that you take all these complicated books, and you filter them through human consciousness and out comes something that makes sense. I agree. And when you filter them out, what you get is humanism. Jefferson did the same thing with the Bible. He took out everything that he thought was contemptible or had nothing to do with the origins of religion. He got 48 pages. I say you could bring it down to one page that said -- or one phrase which would be ""Do unto others as you do -- as you would have done to you."" It is as simple as that. And all of those texts -- -- . The problem is the ancient texts that are infinitely interpretable for any purpose.",2.0
against,"Well, yeah. First of all, Jefferson, who was a man of the enlightenment, not a very devout Christian, as you point out correctly. But when Jefferson was asked, ""What is the source of our rights?"" he could have said the social contract. He could have said the enlightenment. But no, he said it's the creator. He could think of only one source. One word about the texts. I think the point that Rabbi Wolpe and I are stressing is that the way to interpret the text is to look and see whether the people who revered the text do the things in the text. So, for example, he read a passage from Deuteronomy about chopping off people's arms or removing their genitals. So I ask you, how many religious people are going around without arms or genitals? No one who is Jewish or Christian reads the texts that way. So there's a form of, you might say, atheist fundamentalism in taking the text in so literal a way that no Christian -- I mean, there was a debate that between Paul and the early apostles about which aspects of the ancient law should apply to Christians. It was settled 2,000 years ago that Christians would not follow the Old Testament in a literal way. And even the guys in Dover aren't doing that. So in a way, I think these guys are charging an imaginary dragon. You're trying to hold us accountable to texts which were, in a sense, not taken as literal 2,000 years ago. I think your question is echoing an argument in Sigmund Freud that religion is wish fulfillment. We all -- but life is tough, we have diabetes, we have the gravedigger, we would like to have another life, and so religion is made up to accommodate that wish. Now, I think that actually that theory doesn't square with what religion actually holds, and here's why. Certainly it explains heaven. Heaven is a good example of wish fulfillment. But remember that all of the major Abrahamic religions also have hell. Now, think about that. Hell is a lot worse than diabetes. Hell is a lot worse than death. Why would we make that stuff up? The bottom line I'm trying to make is that that diagnosis of religion as expressing wish fulfillment runs headlong into the actual facts that religious people actually sometimes fear a fate far worse than anything that life can offer them. I want to focus on the Holocaust. I would recommend to you this book, ""Hitler's Table Talk."" It's edited by the prominent historian, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and it constitutes direct notes of Hitler's comments authorized by Bormann between 1941 and 1945. In the early 1930s when Hitler was coming to power, he wanted to win over the Bavarian Catholics and the Lutherans in Germany and so he invented what he called a Nazi Christ, not a Christ who was killed but a Jew killer. And he tried to sell that to the churches which didn't go for it. This book records page after page of Hitler's loathing and hatred for Christianity. He regarded the church as the most dangerous opposition to the Nazi regime, and I could read for an hour quotations from Hitler's mouth about his hatred for Christianity. My point is what the atheists will put up on their websites are quotations from the early 1930s, the Mein Kampf where Hitler says, ""I'm doing the lord's work."" This was part of a propaganda campaign to win over the churches that was unsuccessful. Hitler was a hater of Christianity. I've never called Hitler an atheist, he was a certain kind of a pagan.",2.0

Every good deed religious people do is taken along with a banner showing whatever religion did it.

against,"Can I do a poll now of the group? Let me ask you, how many of you had heard of the largest aid organization of the world that I mentioned at the beginning? How many of you had heard of it? Now how many of you had heard of Doctors without Borders? I rest my case. I'll make my own case hard by looking solely at Islam because it is such a controversial subject in our world today. I would submit that the world would be vastly worse -- the Muslim world would be vastly worse if it wasn't for Islam. Let's look at why that's the case. First of all, you have to look at what was there in the Bedouin culture before Mohammed.  Mohammed actually was a moderate in limiting the number of wives to four and by basically saying that you had to treat the four wives equally, giving them all the same gifts and so on. Mohammed essentially ensured that the entire Muslim world, for the most part, you'd have people with one wife. Polygamy is very rare in the Muslim world for that reason. So the bottom line of it is that Islam was a vastly civilizing force, not to mention the introduction of a cosmopolitan civilization with a history, a philosophy and a distinctivearchitecture, not to mention great Islamic philosophers and thinkers. Even the great Jewish scholar Bernard Lewis has a great appreciation for the civilizing influence -- -- of Islam in the world.  I mean, there is personal religious experience, but what we're talking about today is the social organization of religion and what religion does in the world, not so specifically what it does for individuals. So I would -- I'm not going to give it to the Vatican, I promise. I think in the case of the Vatican, the wealth of the Vatican is in priceless treasures, tapestries, the ceiling of the Sistine chapel, art. Now, let's remember -- let's remember -- hold on a second. It's not the Vatican's bank balance. It's the Vatican's treasures. And let's remember that it was popes, the Medici popes and so on, who commissioned those paintings. If it wasn't for Catholicism, we wouldn't have the Sistine chapel. Not only that -- not only that, but in a study of achievement, the social scientist Charles Murray asked this question: Why, at the top of the Gothic Cathedral are there gargoyles that have been detailed and carved in a way that no one can see them? And when the people who did those were asked why they were doing it when no one could see it, they said, we are carving for the eyes of God. The point being that transcendence introduces a new perspective.  The perspective of eternity. And so in a sense, your orientation is different, you act differently. And I'm not defending accumulations of wealth. I concede, religion, like any human institution is susceptible to corruption, a little bit like politics or anything else. But I'm saying on the balance, I think it would be wrong to think that we would be better off as a civilization as a culture, it's not all Athens. It's a combination of Athens and Jerusalem. Was it not Thomas Hobbes who said life was nasty, brutish and short? It wasn't a religious. It was a philosopher. A.C. Grayling: I was quoting him.  Should I take a poll? The -- look, in --John Donvan: David Wolpe. In survey after survey after survey, Americans still pronounce themselves overwhelmingly religious, overwhelmingly religious, 80 percent, 90 percent. It is certainly true. And by the way, and don't discount economic downturn because that also has a profound effect on religious institutions and other nonprofits as it does on the -- on the rest of the economy. I think that you find both trends at the same time. I think that this is a complicated -- you need Balanchine to choreograph this. It's complicated. At the same time as people's religion is still high, their sense of religious affiliation and how they want to express their religion shifts very much. And so I don't think that you necessarily are seeing a decline in people's sense that there's something transcendent, something greater than themselves. But some organized religions, and not all, Mormonism is growing, some evangelical groups are growing, some religions but not all are declining. That is astounding. Are they Jewish now, are they -- Maybe I should do the Vatican -- John Donvan:Dinesh D'Souza. Well, I do think it's -- there was an expectation in the '60s and '70s that the world was becoming secular. Europe was seen as being the automatic vanguard of this and the assumption was that as people become more affluent and educated they will automatically become more secular. It's turned out not to be the case. America has not gone the way of Europe, and in fact if you look at any other culture, we're not seeing this automatic secularization. If you meet a Hindu Ph.D. and a Hindu janitor they're just as likely to be religious. There's no difference. Same in Islam. So I think that it is the disproof of the secular assumption that has in a sense brought out this aggressive new atheism because the atheists thought they were winning anyway, they were winning by default. I think the European case is anomalous. It was not an attack on religion. It was an attack historically on an oppressive alliance between throne and altar. It was a political rebellion against a particular manifestation of religion in that society and the rest of the world is not going that way at all.",2.0

But I do encourage you to take a look and read it and instead I'm going to end with a story. I'm a rabbi. So Rabbi Hugo Gryn was a rabbi in England for many years but he and his father were in Auschwitz when he was a child. And Hanukkah came around. And his father took the precious margarine ration and instead of using it for food he used it to light the Hanukkah candle. And his son protested and said how can you do this? Don't you understand that this is food? And his father said to him, “Listen, my child, we have learned that you can go three weeks without eating. You can go three days without drinking, but you cannot go three minutes without help.” Now we’ve been accused of being too sophisticated to participate in this debate.  Real religious people are simple-minded. But I want to tell you that there are people all over this world, who, whether you think of them as simple-minded or not, the hope of their lives, the purpose of their lives, the good that they do is dependent not in fact on evolutionary pressures alone but on that candle, on the idea that God not threatens them, not is going to send them to hell, but that God created them in God’s own image, that they are precious, that they are sacred, and so are other human beings. And they wouldn’t live three minutes without that hope. And if you vote for the motion, then you’re suggesting that the world would be better if the hope were taken away from them. It isn’t, and you shouldn’t. Rabbi Wolpe and I have been laboring under a tremendous disadvantage in this debate. Both our opponents have a British accent. Now, I was raised in India, and I come from a small part of India called Goa, which was a Portuguese colony for many years. And I’d always assumed that my Christianity was the product quite honestly of the Portuguese Inquisition. The Portuguese came to India with a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other. And lots of people converted. They were extremely persuasive. So I’m very alert to the dangers of religion. On the other hand, I once asked my grandfather, a historian, about this. And he said that the fact of the matter was that tons of Indians flung themselves into the arms of the missionaries. They wanted to convert.  And my grandfather’s answer was that if you look at history, it was because of the ancestral -- not religious, but cultural caste system. Most of the Indians were relegated to the lower caste. And the fact of the matter is that if you were at the bottom, an untouchable, let’s say, there was no way to get out. There was no way to move up. No amount of merit could help you. And so, even though the missionaries might have been greedy and irredentist, the fact that they preached an idea of universal brotherhood, of love, of compassion, inspired people, ennobled their lives. And that’s why they became Christians. A world without religion would in fact be a grimmer, harsher, meaner world. Religion, for all its flaws, gives us a kinder and gentler world. And that’s why it’s better to have a world with religion in it. ",3.0
for,"The world would be better off without religion because it is better off without religion. If religion made people behave better, markers of social dysfunction, drug addiction, ignorance, teen pregnancies, violent crime would be much lower in highly religious societies. In fact, the opposite is true. To quote my friend, Austin Dacey, ""In post Christian Europe, entire nations have been plunked into endemic health, sky rocketing education and hopelessly low rates of violent crime."" This was a disadvantage to the English. AndI'm not-- I'm American. Forgive me for using America by way of comparison. I am an American. I love America. However, 90 percent of Americans believe in God. But we have by far the largest prison population on earth. Drug addiction is widespread. Gun violence is grotesque. Our education system produces kids whose math and science skills are far lower than in secular countries while our rate of teen pregnancy is far higher. And in a country so rich and Christian, it's amazing how many people live in abject poverty. Religion is a rational, morally confusing and divisive. It still exposes young children to the ghastly concept of hell. It still denigrates women. It still fosters homophobia. And ""religious"" gave us 9/11. Making no reference to God, science has, among many other things, rid us of the plagues, smallpox and polio, dramatically reduced infant mortality, doubled the average length of a burdened life and is coming to understand how the brain works, including its capacity for empathy and moral decision making. All this progress, all this beautiful knowledge, all this alleviation of human suffering in 100 years. Religion has had thousands of years to prove its supernatural effectiveness. It hasn't. We think it's time to try a safer and more enlightened way. So I hope you will support our position that the world will be better off without religion.",3.0
