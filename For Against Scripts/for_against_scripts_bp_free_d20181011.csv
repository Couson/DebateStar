for," First of all, thank you all for coming in this weather. Really good to see everybody. And thank you, Hunter College, for having us. Yeah, I accredit everything to my parents. My parents are from Haiti. They are immigrants. They came here decades ago. At the time, Haiti was a dictatorship. And they -- they wanted the American dream. They had heard about the American dream. And So, through that -- through their travel, they ended up here in New York City.  And they've worked So, hard, and their heart and determination, their love for this country and the country where they were born really gave me kind of the fuel to do everything that I've done as John was listing in my career. And without them, I don't think I would have ever ended up in the White House. And because of them, I still continue the work that I do through Moveon. And So, it's my parents and my daughter that really fuels me today. And my hope is that not only will she go for the American dream, but that she will realize the American dream because So, many people in this country are trying to realize the American Dream themselves.",

for,"I want thank you all for coming out. This is a very important question at this very difficult time in our nation's political history. Every day we are reminded that in many ways our country is on the edge of a knife. And we can slide either way. I think all of us recognize the great harm that Trump is doing in this country, the type of hateful rhetoric he's injecting into our country and the way he is changing the mindset of So, many people in this country toward a more divisive and destructive mentality. And it is our job -- but I -- you'll hear some allusions from me later, like comments about the 1930s in America. But in many ways, we are confronting something that our allies confronted in western Europe in 1930s in Europe. And they failed in their attempts to strike down sort of ultra-nationalism and xenophobia and racism, and we cannot afford to fail. There's no one to come. There's no greater -- greatest generation somewhere else to come here and protect us. What does that mean? That means we have got to galvanize the American people, the grassroots of the American people. We've got to unify the American people and create a country that, as Bernie says, that in a government and an economy that works for everyone. And I think as we go through this tonight and we talk a little bit about the history of the Democratic party and where we are today, I think you will see that not only is the sort of neoliberal corporatist view incapable of confronting and defeating Trump, but in many ways, it is responsible for its rise in this country. Our great party, the Democratic Party, the modern Democratic Party, was born in the crucible of the New Deal. FDR came into power at a time of great economic calamity, as all of you know. It was a worldwide depression. And against great opposition from Republicans, from business interests, and frankly, from many inside the Democratic Party, put together a coalition -- created Social Security, created workers' rights, created a lot of investments in this country that we still see today -- the TVA and other things -- that created dominance by democratic politics in this country for decades, this coalition, this grand New Deal coalition. And our job in this country is to rebuild that grand New Deal coalition. This cannot be a party of only upper-middle income people, of only well-to-do suburbanites. This has got to be a party that represents also working-class people and marginalized communities. And what those people understand is that we have big problems in this country and we need bold solutions. And the solutions that are being offered by people in the sort of progressive, populist camp are not unrealistic or undoable if we have the political will in this country. We live in the richest country in the history of the world. All of our western democratic allies have universal healthcare. We do not. We used to have free tuition at public colleges and universities in this country. That's not a new thing. That's kind of an old thing. We used to have that. And we have lost it. The value of the minimum wage has degraded over time. The working people need to have a decent standard of living in this country, whether that's through legislation or putting pressure on companies, as we've seen recently -- Senator Sanders got a third of a million people a raise at Amazon.com. So, we have got to energize and excite people. And what has happened is, after this period of dominance, we had the Reagan Revolution. Although we did not lose the House during that time period; we should remember that. We had the Reagan Revolution. And then a group of folks came along and said, ""The problem with the Democratic Party is we're not really enough in the pocket of Wall Street and financial interests. And if we do that, we can really win."" And they did win. In 1992, Bill Clinton won with 43 percent vote. It was a three-way race, as people may remember. And going down a path of neo-liberal economics. We had NAFTA. We had Most Favored Nation status with China. And we destroyed the relationship between the Democratic Party and its historic working-class base in this country. In 1994, we lost the House of Representatives for the first time since 1952. Seeing that kind of loss and the disconnection between working-class people in and the party, they turned to a very ugly set of policies. DOMA, who attacked the LGBT community. Welfare reform, which was a pared-down version of Reagan's ""welfare queen"" program. The crime bill, which created mass incarceration in this country. We forget that Bill Clinton and Joe Biden are the fathers of mass incarceration in America. And since then, we have been trying to find our way. And in 2016, the grassroots of this party said, ""No more. We want to stand up. We want to reclaim our New Deal heritage. We want to be the dominant party in this country again for decades to come. We want to bring people together and not divide them up. We have got to serve the interests of working people, marginalized communities, and not the rich and the powerful."" And I hope you vote for us at the end of this process.",
against,"The question before us is this. If Democrats run on the ideas of the progressive populists, will that save the Democratic Party? Will these ideas win elections everywhere So, that we can defeat Trump in 2020? The answer is no. Let's start with what we -- all of us on this stage -- have in common. We are all excited about the new generation of candidates hailing from all ideological wings. Young people, women, and people of color are adding dynamism and diversity to the Democratic Party. But where we disagree is over the ideas these candidates should be carrying. The evidence is overwhelming that populist ideas will not help Democrats regain the White House or majorities. They might look good on a bumper sticker. But when voters hear about the details, support crumbles. Take their centerpiece idea: Medicare for All. It has been tested and it has failed. In 2016, the purple state of Colorado had a Medicare for all style initiative on the ballot. It was decimated. Seventy-nine percent voted no. It lost in liberal Boulder. In deep blue Vermont the state passed single-payer in 2011 and gave up on it just three years later because the costs and tax increases were simply too high. Now, I admit that during these mid-term general elections there have been lots of Medicare for all ads on the air, but here's the rub. They're not being aired by Democrats. They're being aired by Republicans as attack ads on Democrats. The GOP knows that if they can label every Democrat as a backer of Medicare for all, as well as other far-left ideas like abolishing ICE, they can retain the House. So, yes, their signature ideas are politically potent for Republicans. Progressive populist ideas are not going to elect Democrats and save us from Trump and democratic voters agree. Bernie Sanders and his allies proclaimed that this would be their year and to prove it they backed a lot of democratic primary candidates carrying his agenda. Well, the primaries are over and how did they do? Twenty-three million people just voted in the democratic primaries. They were our most energized and committed voters turning out in historic numbers to put a check on Trump and they represented a bit tent democratic party, young and old, urban, suburban, and rural, white, black, Hispanic, and Asian. And most of them voted for the more mainstream Democrat and against the democratic socialist. Yes, there were notable exceptions. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Rashida Talib won by running inspired races in cobalt blue districts, but mainstream democrats won almost everywhere else. In the house non-incumbent candidates aligned with the moderate new Democrats won 32 of their 37 primaries, a stunning 86 percent win rate. Meanwhile, our revolution, the group formed by supporters of Bernie Sanders had a dismal 39 percent win rate. So, if running on a Sanders style platform is the way for Democrats to regain power someone had better tell the 23 million democratic primary voters who felt otherwise. And if candidates carrying these ideas can't win primaries, that agenda clearly has no chance of delivering victories in a general election. In June of 2017 Bernie Sanders published an op ed titled, ""How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections."" In it he proclaimed that his ideas were the key to victory, but on the very day it was published democratic primary voters in Virginia had to choose between Ralph Northam and Tom Periello as their gubernatorial nominee. Periello, a talented former congressman, proudly embraced a populist agenda and even featured Bernie in his ads. Northam ran as a proud moderate. So, it was a great field experiment for tonight's debate motion. If progressive populist ideas are the way to win, then especially in a democratic primary it must be that the populist Periello won handily. The reality? Northam crushed him by 12 points and went on to easily win the general election. That Virginia win by a moderate kicked off the primary season. Andrew Cuomo's resounding victory over Cynthia Nixon marked the last. With a handful of exceptions primaries in the 48 states in between delivered similar results. Democrats chose moderate nominees who fit their districts in states and were best positioned to win in a general election. So, remember, if you vote for this motion, you're not saying the democratic socialist ideas and the candidates carrying them can win in Queens. You're saying that these populist ideas can win and save the democratic party everywhere. Twenty-three million democratic primary voters just weighed in on this question. And if they were here tonight, most of them would once again vote no on this proposition. I hope you'll do the same.",1.0
for,"So, let's step back for a second and actually define what we're here to debate. First, populism. Populism is defined in the dictionary as ""support for the concerns of ordinary people."" But I would say everybody here on stage probably agrees with that. Now let's go down a little deeper and really get into the discussion. Populism is not about right versus left, but it's about top versus bottom. Populism actually offers up solutions.  Well, one of the solutions that's it offers up is how do we fight against a society that benefits the privileged, the elites? Now, there are many forms of populism. Donald Trump has his form of populism rhetoric, but his populism is right wing, white nationalist populism. He chooses to divide the country using race, religion, immigration status, and gender. Progressive populism unifies and brings us all together. The late Senator Paul Wellstone used to say, ""When we all do better -- we all do better when we all do better."" Now, economics is key. It's the key tenet of progressive populism, but it's not the only thing. We also have to talk about the systems, the power of systems that are created to help to benefit the privileged and the elites. And I'm talking about white supremacy. I'm talking about patriarchy, Islamophobia and also heterosexism, which is what -- which -- what progressive populism does, it fights against that. It says, ""No,"" to that. So, we also need -- we need inclusive populism and also multiracial populism. Now, many of our opponents would say what we're talking about is identity politics. And identity politics divides people. But then I would say, how are we supposed to get justice if we don't know the reality of our identities? How do we not define who's at the top and who's at the bottom? How do we move forward? As I mentioned earlier in my opening, my parents were immigrants. My dad was a New York City cab driver, my mom, a home health care aide. And I would argue, and I think I would be right to say, that what they -- the issues that they -- that matter to them also matter to their white working-class counterparts. But, look, I'm not here to define, really. That's not the role that I'm supposed to do. But I wanted to give you a sense of populism and progressive populism, what that means. I'm supposed to give you an argument as to why progressive populism is the future of the Democratic party. Jeff did a good job giving the history of populism. I'm going to give you some data points. Progressive populism, as I mentioned, has solutions. Our solutions are actually incredibly popular. For example, Medicare for all. Blake Research did a survey back in April and asked voters in -- in the -- in battleground congressional districts how they felt about Medicare for all. Fifty-four percent strongly support Medicare for all. But I think the most interesting thing about that survey was that Democrat who are infrequent voters, it was more popular with them. So, progressive politics favors debt-free college, which is popular. It favors universal childcare, which is popular. Affordable homeownership, which is important. And we also believe in the auto bailout, which was incredibly successful, thank you, Steve Rattner. And it was a great example of how activism -- how government, when they step into activism can really help the markets and intervene in the markets. That's what it did. But now I want to talk about the successful candidates who are progressive populists that are currently happening right now, and not in blue states. I'm talking about deep red states. The first one is Beta O'Roark. He's running in Texas. Donald Trump won Texas by nine points. Mitt Romney won Texas 16 points. Beta O'Roark is authentic. He's fighting for the people. He's progressive. He's not taking PAC money, he's not taking corporation money, and he's doing really well in that race. Wendy Davis, who lost that -- who lost the governor's race a couple years ago by 20 points, said that she would won -- would run a more progressive campaign, a more authentic campaign if she were to do it again. Andrew Gillam, incredibly progressive, making history. And in the naysayers, in the primary had said, ""Oh, he's too progressive. He's too liberal. There's no way."" He came out in the general election, has been leading in all of the polls in Florida. Trump won that by one or two points. All the past Democratic candidates who were -- who were in the middle have never done as well as he's doing right now. And the irony of that is he's probably going to, on his coattails, help Bill Nelson win, who is a centrist. Look, it's not going to be up to us who are on stage that's going to decide what the -- what the Democratic party is going to do. It's going to be up to activists and voters out in the country, across the country. And they're making it loud and clear. They want the Democratic party to be -- to challenge, I should say, status quo, and to fight for the 99 percent, not the 1 percent. So, progressive populism is the future of the Democratic party. ",1.0
against," Let me start by echoing what John said. I am a Democrat, and I consider myself a progressive, and I consider myself as a fighter for the 99 percent as I think it should be defined. I believe that our tax system excessively favors the rich. I believe that income inequality in our country is at reprehensible levels and must be addressed. I believe that the federal government should lean in and try to solve the pressing problems of those who have been left behind. I believe that America has an important role to play in the world, including by imparting our values of democracy and human rights. But I don't believe that endorsing policy ideas that are either unaffordable or make little economic sense or will do more harm than good, or all three, would somehow be good politics for the Democratic party. Let me do my historical review. There has not been a single Democratic president-elected in our history espousing the kinds of policies that the proponents of this motion advocate, not FDR, Jeff, who ran in 1932 on a platform of balancing the budget; not John F. Kennedy, who, by the way, cut taxes for the rich; not Jimmy Carter, who ran as a self-styled New Democrat; certainly not Bill Clinton, and not even Barack Obama who Senator Sanders attacked as weak for not pushing more robust, i.e., progressive policies. Then there are the losers. George McGovern, who carried just one state and the District of Columbia in 1972. In 1984, Walter Mondale suffered exactly the same fate. Just four years after that, Michael Dukakis was trounced, 426 electoral votes to 111. All of us up here agree that the election of Donald Trump was one of the saddest days of our lifetime. And with an approval rating hovering around 43 percent, there's no way he should be re-elected. But if we want to make the unimaginable imaginable, just nominate someone out of touch with the mainstream of this country. We can talk about all we want about energizing the base. But remember that only 33 percent of Americans are even Democrats at all. It's also worth noting that the share of Independents at 37 percent is the highest in 27 years. Last I looked, you needed around 50 percent to win. You've heard the suggestion that Bernie Sanders could have beaten Donald Trump. We'll never know. But we do know a few things. For starters, it has historically always been very difficult and rare for someone of the same party as a two-term incumbent to win the presidency. After -- after eight years, voters generally want to change, as they did in 2008 and again in 2016. We won't have that impediment in 2020, but we will have a more important problem that hurt Mrs. Clinton, the fact that Democratic voters are increasingly concentrated geographically, particularly in big blue states like New York and California. That's a large part of why Mrs. Clinton lost, even though she got 3 million more votes than Donald Trump. So, to win, we must reach out to more moderate voters in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, and in Wisconsin, three states that we never should have lost. Lastly, you've heard turnout blamed for Secretary Clinton's loss, but at 60.1 percent, turnout was higher in 2016 than it was for Barack Obama's re-election in 2012. Now, let's turn to policy. John made a compelling case for why Medicare for All is bad politics. The same would inevitably be true of some of the other ideas that Senator Sanders and his sympathizers have put forth once the electorate understood the implications. Guarantee a $15 an hour income to all. That would cost in the order of $680 million annually. How about providing a $12,000-a-year basic income to every American? The bill for that, a whopping $3.8 trillion per year. And given that our tax revenue runs about 3.5 trillion annually, paying for that would require doubling taxes. Expand Social Security? That sounds pretty good, until Americans understand that the trust fund is on track to go broke in 2034 and jeopardize the benefits that we've already promised. Just wait until the voters go to Sanders's website, as I did, and find him absurdly claiming that Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus. Make public colleges and universities' tuition free, as Jeff suggested. It's a great goal for the underprivileged. But if any of my kids were to go to a public institution, I have no idea why they should get a free ride. Break up the big banks? That sounds appealing, although apparently not to Mr. Sanders's Senate colleagues, none of whom have signed on as co-sponsors of his bill. Abolish ICE? Only 32 percent of voters of that, while 53 percent understand that Immigration and Customs Service, albeit with reforms, is something that we need to have. Even among Democrats, only 44 percent want to abolish ICE. As I close, I want to re-emphasize the extent to which I share the goals of the populists. I share everything that has been said before me as a goal. But we should address the critical issues facing our nation by putting forward responsible, prudent policies that will attract the coalition of voters that we need to keep Donald Trump from another four years of destroying America. ",1.0
for,"Yeah, well, that is not what we're saying. It's interesting if you want to talk about elections because we just had a presidential election and So, we have a lot of experience. We had a hard-fought democratic primary between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and the evidence is pretty clear. I've seen a zillion polls in a zillion states as you can probably imagine, and Bernie Sanders was winning rural Democrats, conservative Democrats, moderate Democrats, and Secretary Clinton was doing much better with suburban Democrats who on paper look liberal because they are -- you know, they're pro-choice and they support that and global warming and so on and so forth. So, the modeling that was done clearly showed that Bernie was winning the very voters that you were talking about in red places. They were coming out overwhelmingly for Bernie Sanders, which is why he won in Oklahoma. He won in Kansas. He won in Nebraska. He won in Utah. He won in Idaho and on and on it goes and in fact, it is these voters that we need -- that I'm arguing we need to bring back into the town. Working class voters in red states, this question about geographic concentration of democratic supporters and very, very serious problem that we have in an electoral college system and we need to broaden our support geographically and the way you do that is by being unapologetically on the side of working people in these states. We all forget that the Midwest of this country used to be the center of progressive politics in this country. The plain states was where progressivism rose in this country and we have lost touch with those people because the truth of the matter is that there are many people in that wing of the party who really don't like those people very much.",2.0

Of the 84 competitive races, 76 percent, right, three quarters of those folks, have been endorsed either by the new Democrats in the House or the blue dogs, the conservative Democrats in the House. Just 4 percent have been -- been endorsed by justice Democrats and our revolution. So, look at who's actually running. The people who won these races are moderate, mainstream Democrats. And they're the people who, God willing, are going to put a check on Trump and hand us back the House.  First of all, I don't know that Trump had very many big ideas. He had a slogan: ""Make America Great Again."" And every -- and it was actually quite brilliant, even though he stole it from Ronald Reagan, in that – Right. I'm getting – -- to that point. Look, the fact was and is that there were still huge numbers of Americans who have been left behind. When you look at median wages, adjusted for inflation, when you particularly separate them out and look at what's happened to people toward the bottom -- even during the Obama recovery, as hard as President Obama tried to make it better for everybody, the fact is that for a variety of reasons, you had a large group of Americans who felt angry, who felt left out, who felt left out by the Democratic Party because it was worrying about a lot of other interest groups -- or at least they perceived that to be the case. And they decided to vote for Donald Trump. And, as I said during my remarks, it is almost without precedent -- and I think there may be two or three examples in 200-and-some-odd years -- of someone of the same party as an eight-year president succeeding because people like change -- they want change after eight years. So, Mrs. Clinton -- and she had 300 million more votes than Donald Trump anyway, but they were in not exactly the right places by 70,000 votes. And So, you had a kind of perfect storm of events that caused him to be elected. I don't think the fact that he got elected suggests that Medicare for All -- let me just say one thing about Medicare for All, and then I'll shut up. When you say -- if you go to any of these people, half of Americans get their healthcare from their employer. You say to them, ""You're going to lose your healthcare from your employer, and you're going to become part of government healthcare"" -- you think they're going to support that?",2.0
for,"Well, apparently – No. Go ahead. Apparently, Elizabeth Warren thinks they do.   And these are all people who are going to be running for president of the United States, just in case that escaped you. Bernie Sanders thinks they will.

Unfortunately, in this country as well Russia, Poland, Hungary, Israel, we've now seen it in Brazil and we have got to bring countries together around the world to combat that, right? I mean, we're again talking about the 1930s, but what that does not mean is that we go to war every time there's, you know, some economic interest of a billionaire class is being attacked somewhere. This is the history of foreign policy certainly in Central America and Latin America and this country and certainly in the Middle East. I don't think anybody here in this room can seriously say that if we weren't addicted to oil that there would be any Americans in the Middle East.  What was the -- I'm sorry. What was the question?  I think what we saw in 2016 with Hillary Clinton and people of color is that they were not inspired to vote for her. They were -- the issues weren't there. They weren't talking to them. Another thing that was happening around that time in 2015 was the Black Lives Matter movement, which really played into Hillary -- the Hillary Clinton's platform, right? The crime bill came up, which was a big issue that came from the moderate Democrats and it played into the elections of 2016. And So, there was a lot of feeling from in particular young black voters who didn't feel that the campaign was talking to them, who didn't feel that there was a place for them because they remembered the Clinton years because of what was happening in 2015 with black -- young black bodies being killed on the streets.

The debate motion is, if a candidate in the future carries these ideas, will that candidate win? And so far, just to be clear, I've not heard much evidence that that's the case. And I think you really have to distinguish the difference between liking some of the ideas, whether you think they're good or bad ideas from whether they'll win. And I've not heard evidence that those ideas would win. So, for example, Medicare for All, if it were such an overwhelming popular idea, how could it lose 79-21?

It's because of the issues that he was running on. He was running on protecting social security. He was running on protecting Medicare and Medicaid. And so, I guess the point that I'm making on it is that issues matter as well. Those issues that I am just talking about matter. Now, where do you guys stand on that?

There was just a report that came out of a very conservative school in northern Virginia which showed that, in fact, aggregate health care spending in this country would go down substantially if you had a Medicare for All system. So, will people be paying more taxes? Yes, they will be. There's no doubt about that. You can't get around that. Will they pay less in premiums? Yes, because they won't pay any premiums. They won't pay any copayments. They won't pay any deductibles.

Why did we lose the House in 1994? Because Bill Clinton raised taxes and the people did not want that. So, there is a -- a limit to what amount of -- I'm for tax increases. I said that in my opening remarks. You can raise my taxes to whatever you want.

What I would say to you is, on the issue of free tuition in public colleges and universities, we already have K through 12. I think all support probably going down to pre-K. I don't know if you guys are in that camp or not. So, we have an arbitrary deadline where, once you get past 12th grade, we cut you off. We didn't used to, by the way. In New York state and California and other places, you didn't used to get cut off at 12th grade. That's an arbitrary thing that's been put in. I know Steve doesn't want his kids getting a free ride. But if his kid shows up in first grade, he's going to get a free ride. That's just the way we work it in this country. We have universal secondary, primary, and early education. And hopefully, it's earlier. There's no reason why we can't have it for undergraduate school or even graduate school. There's not -- our European allies do -- in many cases do do it that way.

But something really significant happened then. In 2009, Democrats controlled everything, the White House, the House, and the Senate. So, something -- the real marker isn't 1994. The real marker is 2009, what happened since then. I would argue that a big piece of what's happened since 2009 is that Sanderism and progressive populism became more and more and more prominent and more identified with the Democratic party, such that it drove a lot of voters away. We have to remember, 2009 was the high water mark in recent years for Democratic majorities and Democratic control of the White House. And again, Sanders said that Obama wasn't progressive. But Obama won twice and built a historic coalition.

Today, we are seeing young children locked in cages, torn from their mothers. That's only the beginning of what can happen in this country. And to do that, we have got to rally working people and marginalize people and young people, excite them and bring them into the political process. The challenge facing the Democratic party today is, is it even going to be relevant in 10 years? Young people are overwhelmingly registering as Independents. We have got to build the party of the future. We have to have bold vision. We have to have big plans to deal with big problems. These guys have had their shot. They have wrecked the party. They have destroyed the coalition that undergirded the Democratic party for decades. And we can't let them have it back. ",2.0

On the morning of November 9th, 2016, my twin 10-year-old daughters woke at 7:00 a.m. And in their bright, innocent voices, they asked, ""Is Hillary president now?"" That look, the shock on their face when I said, ""No, Donald Trump won,"" I don't ever want to see that again. That's why I'm here tonight. And that's why all of you are. The question is, are progressive populist ideas the way to stop Trump and his allies? The answer is no. And two House races this year tell the tale in microcosm. In Omaha, Nebraska, Kara Eastman, a Bernie-style populist, is trying to win back a swing congressional seat Democrats held as recently as 2014. That district is so even that the last three elections were decided by three points or less, perfect conditions for a blue wave environment. So, with all that, Eastman must be in great shape, right? Kara Eastman, running passionately on Bernie's agenda, is getting crushed. She's down nine points. Meanwhile, in central Virginia, Abby Spanberger is running as a mainstream Democrat. Her Republican opponent won that seat by 16 points two years ago. Democrats haven't held this seat in 40 years. Her race is tied. We may actually flip a red seat because we ran a bold and modern centrist Democrat. Saving the Democratic party requires winning everywhere to regain the House now and to fire Trump in 2020. As Kara Eastman's situation makes clear, we can't save the party. We can't win general elections with a set of socialist ideas and candidates that even the most -- even the most Democratic primary voters just rejected.

And it's not centrism, and it's not incrementalism. It's a bold, progressive vision for our future. Let me tell you about Chuck T. Chuck is a veteran who joined the Army to pay for college. In the army, he fell in love with being part of something bigger than himself. Now one of our MoveOn volunteer leaders, Chuck says progressive policies reflect the core Army values instilled in him through a decade of service, that he sees championing progressive policies as his second service to this country. Or think of Carmen V., a MoveOn member who says centrist Democrats have never inspired her to do more than vote. But she has been inspired recently to act by issues like incarceration reform and separation of immigrant families. And by progressive public officials like Beto O'Rourke and Jeff Barkley. She is now simultaneously volunteering, and not just for MoveOn, but for several progressive candidates. If the Democratic party will be saved, it will be saved by volunteers and activists like Carmen and Chuck. And what they themselves tell us is that progressive ideas inspire them. Activists like Carmen and Chuck will save the Democratic party. And majority of voters who strongly agree with Carmen and Chuck will save the Democratic party. I think it's already evident to probably most of us in this room that progressive populism is the direction of the Democratic party, therefore I hope you vote today for progressive populism to save the Democratic party.",2.0

And I do want to genuinely commend our opponents for their passion and their commitment to the Democratic cause. I'd also like to close on a -- with a more subjective personal observation. It may surprise some of you, but even as a business person, I live in a world that is dominated by centrists, moderate Democrats, Independents, and moderate Republicans. Not all my friends are financial types. They include lawyers, academics, journalists, public servants, and so forth. Within that universe, I know very few people who voted for Donald Trump last time and even fewer who would vote for him next time. But I also know vast numbers of people who say they could never vote for someone like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, not because they're not good people, but because of their ideas. But my friends simply don't believe that the policies of the far left are fiscally responsible, nor that they would improve the functioning of our economy, which for of its challenges, which I will recognize, is still the envy of the developed world. So, to me, it comes down, in large measure, to practical realities. Nominate someone from the fringe of our party, and we could very well end up losing an election two years from now that, by all rights, we should win.
