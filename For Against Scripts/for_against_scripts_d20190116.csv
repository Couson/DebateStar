for,"Thank you, John. Thank you, Intelligence Squared and Foreign Affairs. Thanks to my partner, Jason, and our esteemed opponents Ken and Robert, and of course to the audience. Thank you all for being here on this really important topic. I was really surprised when I was asked to argue this motion to argue in favor of the notion that the system is safer. Because while I ran the TARPs, I was in the middle of the financial crisis back in ’07, ’08, ’09, I have become one of their biggest critics of the banks in America. The banks really don’t like me because I’ve been very outspoken, saying we need to do more. We need to be tougher on the banks to protect taxpayers, to protect the public against future financial crises. So why would I argue in favor of this motion? Because the motion is not, “Are we perfectly safe?” We’re not. The motion is, “Are we safer than we were 10 years ago?” And Jason and I are going to argue that unquestionably we are safer than we were 10 years ago. Now, both Jason and I want to go further. We want to be even tougher. But the question is, have we made progress? The answer is yes, we have made progress. So Jason and I have analyzed this across five different dimensions that we’re going to lay out for you tonight. And on three of those dimensions we’re going to demonstrate that the system is safer. On two of the dimensions we’re going to demonstrate that the system is the same. So three dimensions safer, two dimensions the same. Overall, we’re going to argue that means the system is, in fact, safer than we were 10 years ago. I’m going to start with the first three of these dimensions and then Jason later is going to follow up with the other two dimensions. So first dimension are the big banks. You all remember the ’08 crisis. The big banks were at the center of this crisis. And I want to be tougher on the big banks. But the biggest banks are safer than they were 10 years ago, and we should be honest about that. So the single best thing you can do to make a bank safe is make sure it has enough capital to protect the taxpayers in case it makes mistakes. So what is capital? If you take out a loan to buy a house, the bank is going to make you put a down payment. My wife and I had to put 20 percent down on our house. The more money you put down the safer your loan is. If you put down 30 percent, it’s safer than if you put down 20 percent. Well, banks have to put down some money on their own investments, and they have about twice as much capital as they had 10 years ago. That means they’re safer. Banks also -- you know, if they borrow money -- when you deposit money in a bank, the money -- the bank is borrowing your money. And the more of that money that people can pull out very quickly, the riskier the bank. Well, the bank -- that’s how they fund themselves. They’re funding themselves longer term so the money cannot simply be pulled out as quickly as it was 10 years ago. By that dimension the banks are safer. And then regulators have a lot of additional tools to deal with banks if they do get into trouble. So Jason and I are going to argue that it’s unquestionable the big banks are safer than they were 10 years ago. So we agree, we want to go even further. So that’s dimension number one. Dimension number two. What about the non-banks? What about the rest of the financial system? You’ve heard of things like mortgaged-backed securities. Wall Street takes a bunch of mortgages, they package them together, they slice them up, and then they sell them all around the world. That was one of the key risks in the financial crisis. That activity has fallen by about 75 percent securitization from where it was 10 years ago. Or if you take money market funds, you might remember that there was a famous fund that led to Lehman’s failure, where a money market fund blew up. That activity is now 75 percent of the money market -- the risky money market funds -- 75 percent lower than it was 10 years ago. You probably heard about people getting loans where no money down, no documenting income. They call them ninja loans: no income, no job, no asset, you get a mortgage, right? That’s no more. You can’t do that anymore. So if you look outside of the banking sector, it’s clear that the rest of the financial system is also safer than it was 10 years ago. So two dimensions that I’ve talked about so far: the banks, safer; the non-banks, the rest of the financial system, also safer. Now, I want to shift to talk about what we do if a crisis actually happens. I want to talk about monetary policy. So I’m president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, I’m one of the policymakers who sets monetary policy for the nation. If there’s a recession or if there’s a crisis, typically what the Federal Reserve will do is it will cut interest rates to try to stimulate the economy. And you may remember, interest rates are lower today than they were 10 years ago. They’re around 2 and a half percent for the federal funds rate. Well, so people will say, well, that means the Federal Reserve has less room to cut than it did 10 years ago, and that’s true. But we have other tools to also stimulate the economy. You might have heard something called quantitative easing, where the Federal Reserve will go out and buy long-term bonds to try to drive down long-term interest rates. The reason that we do that is if there’s a recession, we want to make it cheaper for you to go get a mortgage or for a business to go get a loan. Well, one of the things that the fed has now that we didn’t have 10 years ago, we have a lot more experience using some of these other tools. The Fed did it in the crisis, but they weren’t sure if it was going to work and they weren’t sure if it was going to have all sorts of unintended consequences. Ten years later, we have a lot more experience than we had on how to use these other tools. So, it is true that interest rates are lower so there’s less room to cut, but these other tools we have more confidence and experience in using them. So, overall on monetary policy, Jason and I think we’re about where we were, we’re about even. So, I’ve presented three dimensions to you. Two of them were clearly safer; one of them were neutral. Jason is going to come up later and argue in the other two we’ve been some progress and in the other case we’re neutral, overall the system is safer. Thank you very much.",nan
for,"It’s great to be back. It’s great to be with all of you. With a current college, Ken. Former colleague, Neel. I think Bob’s argument illustrated a lot of our point. I was worried about almost everything he raised, but every time he raised something, I was thinking to myself, “Boy, do I feel better about that given the changes we’ve made today than I did 10 years ago.” Take something like, derivatives. Ten years ago, they were the Wild West. You could invent them, you could customize them. You could just do them between any two people. You know. Are there too many of them? Are they too risky now? Yeah. But, they’re much more standardized. You have to do them -- most of them have move to what’s called Central Clearing Houses, where all of them go through a place. Much more transparent. And I think really importantly, we used to look really carefully at some of our community banks to make sure they had enough capital. What Neel was talking about, so important with banks. Some of the places we didn’t used to look at, Lehman Brothers. I don’t know if any of you remember that. It hasn’t been around for a bit. But we barely examined that in any way. We barely examined AIG. And we’re looking at all of those places in the financial system now. Maybe not enough, maybe not as much as we should. But now the systemically important institutions get designated as such. They fall under the Federal Reserve. And so, a lot of the parts of the financial system Bob is talking about really were the Wild West. We didn’t even try to look at them, and we’ve brought a modicum of order to them. We’re looking at them. Neel gave you three arguments. I want to now talk about two more. The first is international. When I was in the White House, once we got through, you know, the worst of our part of the crisis, I spent the last six years of the administration losing far more sleep over what was happening overseas than what was happening in the United States. The Eurozone crisis, China, and the like. I’m not losing sleep anymore. Mostly that’s because I’m not in the White House anymore. But some of that’s, you know, a little bit better than it was. And let me just tick through the areas internationally. Europe: a lot of the reforms Neel talked about here have happened there. So, their banks are also holding more capital. They also have more of a cushion before there’s a crisis. Europe also regulated its banks -- each country had separate regulation. And if you thought a country like Greece was getting in trouble, you also thought they weren’t -- their banks were going to get in trouble, and you could have this sort of, what’s called a doom loop between those. There’s still a risk of that, but now, across the Eurozone, there is a single supervisor. And there’s a single authority to deal with banks if they get into problems. They’ve also created something called the European Stability Mechanism, that has €700 billion. Didn’t exist before, and that’s there to aid countries in a crisis. Greece came close to the brink, but the willingness to keep them in the system was critical to where it is today. In addition to Europe, the IMF has more resources than it had going into the crisis. Central banks in the crisis invented this thing where they’d be willing to swap money; they’d lend each other money. That’s now institutionalized. So I actually think we have more global cooperation, that we’re starting from now, for the next crisis. And something we used to worry a lot about, and we’ve forgotten entirely, is oil. The United States is now the world’s biggest oil producer. We produce the majority of the oil we use. Something like the types of recessions we had in 1973, 1979 aren’t on anyone’s top worry list anymore. So internationally, more likely to prevent a crisis by having better capitalized banks in places like Europe. Better tools to fight it, a lot more resources and cooperative arrangements in place. Now let’s come to fiscal policy. The United States has a lot more debt than it had a decade ago. I wish we had less debt. I don’t think that debt is going to constrain in fighting a crisis for three reasons. First of all, in some ways, our fiscal situation has actually improved. You don’t want it to slip backward. You want to look forward at all of our entitlements and all of those problems. Those are still there. They’re smaller. Expected health spending has gone down. The deficit in Medicare has gone down. And when the Congressional Budget Office measure what we would need to do to stabilize our debt, they actually find that smaller now than it was a decade ago, largely because of some of those improvements in healthcare. Second, the measure of how serious your fiscal situation is what your interest rates are like. And interest rates now are much lower than they were before the crisis. Financial markets expect them to be more likely to fall than to rise, and that will give us a substantial amount of space to do fiscal stimulus if we need it. Third, there’s now been a substantial body of research, and it’s consistently found that fiscal policy is just as effective, if not more effective, in the situation we’re in. So overall, our banking system is safer. Our non-financial system is safe. Our international system is safer. Monetary and fiscal policy have just about as much room as they had before the crisis. So overall, Neel and I are arguing that the system as a whole is safer, and urge you to vote for the motion. Thank you.",1.0
against,"Thank you very much to Intelligence Squared and to Foreign Affairs. And I also have the say, the venue here is Hunter College; my mother was a graduate of Hunter College, and very proud of that. I want to start by saying, when you have financial crises, the next war’s usually pretty different than the last war. They don’t always come from the same place, and it’s certainly important to prepare for what happened last time, but I think a really critical element of the system is the leadership, making decisions. When we had the financial crisis, we had a small number of people that included Neel and Jason, who were making decisions, and of course most famously Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, Tim Geithner. It was a very strong team, and they had support. President Bush -- Ben Bernanke writes about this -- even though he was a conservative and wanted to have tight budgets -- well, except when he cut taxes. He said he wanted to have tight budgets, but, you know, he went -- he got up and he said, “We’re going to do something like a $450 billion stimulus.” Obama later increased that. That was very painful. But the point is they had his support. We have, I think, excellent central banks now, the teams across the central banks, not just in the U.S. but in England and the European Central Bank, an excellent staff, but you need more than that when you have a financial crisis. You need huge changes -- Jason’s mentioned fiscal policy. You need the support of the president. You need the support of Congress. TARP was a very important part of dealing with the financial crisis. That was really something Congress struggled through. If you look at Mario Draghi, the central banker, was famous -- you may have heard this -- in Europe for, “I will do whatever it takes. We will do whatever it takes. And, believe me, it will be enough.” And when he said those words, it was considered absolutely watershed in the European financial crisis. But believe you me, had he not visited Berlin first and Angela Merkel said, “I want you to do this,” he would not have been able to because the governments own the central banks. Well, I mean, the Fed team is still excellent, but I simply don’t think you could describe that we have a safe pair of hands at the moment, not just at the highest levels but the team. I’m sorry to appeal to this, I guess it’s not fair, but it’s the world that we actually live in. And even if we had confident technocrats in other key positions outside the Fed, I’m not sure they’d be listened to. There are some good ones, some ones -- my colleague Greg Mankiw praised Kevin Hassett who’s the chief of the Counsel of Economic Advisors which Jason had, and he also mentioned Larry Kudlow. He didn’t mention Steve Mnuchin; he’s the Treasury sectary, although surely had he seen Wonder Woman, Mad Max, or his acting role as IMDB has him, a movie called “Rules Don’t Apply,” he might have had a different view. If you go across the pond, the U.K. is the other big financial system. They’re like, you know, committing suicide right now in the U.K., and they’re not even facing a real problem. I mean, I think it’s kind of clear that, you know, you have a problem there. And, you know, in general the problem is deeper than just the persons; it’s something having to do with populism. Let me just pick up on a few other points. I do think our ability to do fiscal policy is limited. I actually agree with Jason; it should not be. We should feel like we have a free hand. But I don’t know if any of you, you know, follow our political system, but fiscal policy is actually not this sterile thing in a textbook. You decide who -- not just whether you cut taxes, do you raise government spending, whose taxes, what do you spend on, and I don’t have the impression even in the United States, much less some other countries, we’re going to do this in a very nuanced way that’s going to work well. And as far as monetary policy goes, we can come to that later, but I actually think the tools are very limited, and we have learned something; we have learned that a lot of these creative tools don’t really work very well. I do concede that the banking system, narrowly defined, is safer, but I think Bob made the point, the financial system is not necessarily safer. The financial system as a whole, it's big; it’s gotten bigger. The IMF reports $200 trillion in debt and using Bob's analogy of a car on a hill, your brakes may have gotten better, but you're on a much higher hill than you were, in terms of our financial system. So, we can go into other things; interest rates are very low, but what if they're not? What if global interest rates, not because of policy, but something happened -- they went up. We are not tuned to deal with that at the moment. There are so many things that would blow up. Italy would be an example. The system is so vulnerable to that. There are other issues we can go into later on the limits, but I think -- I know it’s not fair, but if you feel safer about anything right now, you're dreaming.",1.0
for,"Well, as I said in some of my comments, if you look at many elements of the financial system, outside of the banks, it’s also safer; as Jason talked about, derivatives, many derivatives, now go through a clearing house, where it’s not just in the shadows, one bank to another bank, but they're centrally located, there's a lot of transparency. Securitization is way down. Money markets are much safer than they were 15 years ago. So, you're right, there are still risks out there, but if you look at the whole financial system outside of the baking sector, on most mentions, it is substantially safer 10 or 15 years ago. Now, we’re not arguing that there's no risk and nothing can go wrong. The question is, is it safer than it was 10 or 15 years ago? On almost every dimension it is safer. Yeah, I mean, we've fought hundreds of wars, and if you want to read about all hundreds of those wars, Ken's book is particularly great on them. A lot of them are the banking system. This isn’t some random little footnote. That’s been the source of a lot of the financial crises throughout history, and whatever goes wrong anywhere is the system, our banking system has a lot more resources than it had. I feel better about it, no matter what the problem. It’s central to the financial system, and it has this feature, that the banks borrow money very short-term and they lend it long-term, and that mismatch can create a problem. Because you got the It’s a Wonderful Life-type of bank run. We've reduced the risk of that banking system, but you had that throughout the financial system, with lots of institutions borrowing things like overnight repo, triparty repo, and the like. They were putting up these securities that were terrible and junk, and then all of that collapsed. All of those part of the financial systems, the way we made securities, the way we manufacture derivatives. The way institutions -- you know, what they had to hold against them. All of that we have changed quite a lot. It gets very technical and very boring quite quickly. But it's -- we don't know where it’s coming next, that’s why we're looking in a lot more places now than we were a decade ago.",2.0
against,"Well I first want to give another example in addition to what Bob said of like the next war. And I think cyber-war, cyber security is just -- we just don’t know what happens when something's not -- actually, in the 2008 crisis, when one of the key dealer brokers was in the Twin Towers that covered a lot of U.S. Treasury market. They just hadn’t imagined there could be that problem, so you know, that’s certainly an example. But also, as you put constraints on the banking system, stuff flows elsewhere. Interest rates are very low people are looking for risks, so Federal Reserve, former Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, commented on this recently. She -- the techno mumbo jumbo is, you know, coming at light leveraged loans. But very risky stuff without a lot of contingencies or collateral. And I think -- I mean, obviously Neel has a lot of information on this, but I think that certainly I don’t feel, as an outsider, that we know everything the banks are doing; where they’re lending to someone who seems safe, you know, hedge fund or something, and then they make a really risky loan, but implicit in some way it can come back on the financial system’s books. Our banking system has always been at the center of crises. But our banking system’s been shrinking, and that’s one of the reasons the U.S. came out faster. It’s less important to our system, and these other things have gotten more important.",2.0
for,"Can I -- let me break in -- But we weren’t even -- Ken, we weren’t even looking before. No one was looking at Lehman. Fannie and Freddie could borrow as much as they want. Now we’re looking at them. We may not see everything, and Fannie and Freddie can’t borrow all that they want. See, one of the challenges I have with your argument is that you’re basically saying that this is an unsolvable problem, because the next crisis is going to come from somewhere different. And you never know where it’s going to come from. So there’s nothing you can do about it. We’ve taken the smart, rational actions, that by looking at the history of the world economy, where crises have come from in the past, made prudent measures to try to make sure that we’re safer. And I feel very confident that we’ve taken important steps in the right direction. But to just say, “But we don’t know, an asteroid might hit us.” But what are we supposed to do with that as policymakers, right? We have to make decisions based on data and analysis and history, and we’ve made smart decisions based on that, and the system is clearly safer. Just saying we haven’t defended against an asteroid isn’t very helpful. But you already conceded that capital helps -- Capital helps, right? If you’re worried that a bank will take the whole system down, they have twice as much capital as they used to have. We had no bankruptcy regime for Lehman also. There’s rules if just your sort of plain vanilla industrial goes bankrupt; there’s rules if a small bank goes bankrupt. We had no way at all of handling Lehman. We have one on paper now. It goes by the name Resolution Authority. They’ve written out a living will, all of them, what they’d do. Again, do I think it’s going to be perfect? Am I sure it’s going to work exactly in a crisis? No. But boy, do I feel better knowing that we have those rules now to handle the bankruptcy of a large, complex financial institution. Again, derivatives. I think you’re making our point.",2.0
against,"I mean, do we think they’re going to allow a large bank to go bankrupt? Because the problem is they’ve also made it hard for the Fed to do the more creative things that it did in order to avoid that. And I think it’s unclear. I think the market thinks -- doesn’t believe that they’d be allowed to go under.",2.0
for,"I think the Fed just needs to be a little bit more creative than it did last time. And if it does that, then it can do everything. And I think the market’s more realistic about the banks now. I was at Treasury from ’06 to ’09, and people may forget, in the middle of the financial crisis, we had another presidential election in 2008, Senator McCain and then Senator Obama, that was hardly political harmonious time. I mean, I was sitting in the gallery above the House of Representatives when the House voted down the TARP the first time. I don’t know if you remember. Members of congress were telling us their phones were ringing off the hook, 99 to one saying, “Don’t you dare vote for this.” Then the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 777 points that afternoon, and two days later they voted for it. Our democracy is deeply flawed, imperfect, but in moment of crisis we tend to come together, and I believe that in a moment of a future crisis -- we came together in 2008; I believe in the moment of future crisis, American history has shown that we will come together and do what’s necessary on behalf of the American people. That was what I lived; that was my experience in 2008. I think it’s true together.",2.0
against,"Well, I mean, you have to have -- first of all, have guidance on what it is you want to do, and that comes from the top. I mean, so, yes, our democracy may be strong, but that doesn’t mean that we’ll handle it well. I want to also say that we’re looking not just at the United States; we have to think about the whole world. Do I feel safer about European banks? The market sure doesn’t feel safe about Deutsche Bank who sells at a fraction of its book value. If something were to happen with the euro, their banks are very vulnerable. Chinese banks, maybe you say we don’t care about, but we’ve never had a situation -- they’re slowing down and could absolutely have a problem that radiates out. There are things that we can’t necessary anticipate. So, you know, to sort of summarize, you can have a flood and you build -- you know, you build your moat a little higher or your seawall a little higher, but if you have global warming, it doesn’t necessary mean you became safer. Our financial system’s gotten much bigger by measures of total debt, total financial assets, and I -- It’s doing a great job, but it doesn’t mean we’re safer.",2.0
for,"Yeah. I mean, certainly I don’t -- at least speaking for myself, I’m not going to turn this into a debate for and against the people President Trump has chosen to appoint throughout his government, but the fact that we had such good people last time and had such a terrible crisis, I think makes our point. If I had to choose between the best people in the world dealing with a financial system where you weren’t watching most of it, where banks were undercapitalized, where there was a huge bubble, where you were making terrible loans or households were going deeper and deeper in to debt, or a system where the rules were a lot better, you know, a lot of those indicators were better, and the people weren’t quite as good, I think I’d choose the system especially since those people aren’t necessary there forever and the system has a greater durability to it. So, you know -- so I, again, would sort of rather have the hand we have now. Plus the Fed play an enormous role in this. The U.K. government has excellent regulators who are completely focused even while all this craziness is going on over there. China, you know, it’s certainly a rift. Last time around, it did a huge fiscal stimulus. Part -- it suffered from the crisis much less but they have $3 trillion in reserves, huge amount to control over their economy.",2.0
against,"I mean, I think if global inflation adjusted interested rates quadrupled, everything would blow up. Even the United States would have a very hard time handling that. That is extraordinarily unlikely. But, if they went up one and a half percent, Italy could blow up. Their rates, risky lenders go up a lot more. That’s the mother of all risks out in the system. We’ve had them trending down. It’s quite possible. I’m talking about global inflation adjusted interest rates. It’s likely they’ll go down as up, frankly. It’s not obvious what direction. But we’re not a hedge fund. We’re trying to, you know, take into account outside risk. Giant financial crisis do not happen every three years. Although, we’re doing somethings to engineer that with deregulation that’s happened. And by the way, deregulation isn’t just about the rules. It’s about who’s enforcing the rules. And when you appoint regulators outside the Federal Reserve, who are sort of, not enforcing the rules, and the way it’s done in the financial system is not very different than the Environmental Protection Agency, you know, you can get problems.",2.0
for,"I mean, I haven’t seen any evidence that that’s true. I travelled around my region all the time. I meet with banks who are always saying that the regulations are too tough. Again, I want to be tougher on them yet, but so far, we’re not hearing banks that are not -- they're breathing a sigh of relief that now all of the sudden people have taken it easy on them. So, you can make that assertion; I just don’t see any evidence.",2.0
against,"The whole financial system. But with banks, the question, “What are they doing that you don’t know where their implicitly guaranteeing things outside their system that could come back on their books?”",2.0
for,"Yeah, I think -- I mean, I think I’m a little bit more sympathetic to Ken’s point. And I think that’s a little bit in the vain of, I told you before that we now have these rules that if an institution is systemically important, if it can bring the whole system down, we’re allowed to regulate it. That’s not something we had before. The Obama administration used that tool quite actively. This administration I think has used it less actively. That makes me nervous, but that again sort of makes our point that we have zero before the crisis. Now we have this new tool, and we’re using it half as well as I’d like us to use it. The next administration could use it even more. And even the half we’re doing now and the fact that it’s on the book is better than if we didn’t have that tool at all. I think we have better tools than we had before. As Neel said on fiscal and monetary policy, we’re in about the same place. With fiscal policy, you know, I’m worried about our political system too, but somehow, we managed to do a massive fiscal stimulus last year when we didn’t need one. If we really do need one again, I’ll bet we can get around to it. You have these rules that let you handle the bankruptcy of a large financial institution. You have central banks that communicate with each other across countries and share resources in a way that they didn’t use to before. The IMF has twice the resources it had to fight a fire. Europe has a brand new, you know, €700 billion to fight it. So, I think we have more tools to fight a fire now. It’ll still burn down some houses, but fewer than it did last time. I think it’s a fair point. I think there’s a lot of scrutiny in these new clearinghouses, from regulators to look at making sure that they have the resources that they need, that they are netting these positions against one another so that they’re reducing the exposure that they themselves take. Do I think it’s perfect? No, but are we better off having these clearinghouses with this transparency than we were 10 or 15 years ago, when it was the Wild, Wild West? I think unquestionably we’re better off than where we were 10 or 15 years ago. So, I’m not satisfied that we’re done, but I feel very confident that we’ve made progress. In terms cyber, when I look at cyber, it’s an arms race. The bad guys are investing in new technology every day. So are the good guys. My best assessment is we’re still roughly neutral. The bad guys have made progress. The good guys have made progress. The arms race is about where it was 10 years ago, though the tools are probably different.",2.0

We haven’t protected against the asteroid. We have to take action on things that we can see, that we can learn from the past, that we can measure, and that we can analyze. That’s all we can do as policymakers. And given the risks that have hit the global financial system in recorded history, we’ve taken the prudent steps to make the system safer.

They were big players in what happened in the last natural crisis. John Donvan: -- it would be like getting your credit score. Yeah, they said some of these things were really safe that weren’t. These complex Rube Goldberg-type things that the financial sector created. And they still really have not addressed the problem that’s had -- who pays for these ratings. It’s the borrowers pay for the ratings, and so that’s a --",2.0
for,"Yeah, I agree. No, if I -- a lot of financial reform advocates had a list of probably about 10 things they wanted fixed. We had that derivatives question before about the clearing houses. You know, a lot of people were advocating for derivatives moving to clearing houses for a long time from the public policy community. The financial institutions didn’t like it; lobbied against it, and after the crisis we stopped listening to the financial institutions and we started listening to the experts and we made the system a little bit safer. If you listed the 10 things that were in that category, I’ll see you on ratings agencies -- that’s something we commissioned to study in Dodd-Frank. And I think the study was done, not much was done. The other is the regulation of insurance; it’s still done at the state level, not the national level, but those are sort of two out of the 10 things that experts wanted to see fixed that I think, you know, weren’t addressed in Dodd-Frank. But it’s the same as it was 10 years ago. So, that’s an example where it’s neutral. It was a problem 10 or 15 years ago, it’s still a problem today, but we’ve made progress in other areas. So, on the whole the system is safer.",2.0
against,"But the system’s bigger. You had a continued, booming growth in the financial sector.",2.0
for,"Well, let’s -- Okay. Yeah, it’s -- I think it’s a very simple answer to your question. There’s a lot of problems for households for families. We can talk about those another time. Almost all of the student debt are guaranteed by the government. So, if people don’t pay, it’s not going to take down the financial system or cause a financial crisis. That’s not to say it isn’t a big deal for those families, but it’s nothing like mortgages, which weren’t guaranteed, and did take down the financial system. These are guaranteed and it’s also a lot smaller than mortgages; I think mortgages are about $8 trillion. Obviously it’s hard to know for sure, but I read a lot of American history. And the more American history that I read, the more I realize that political dysfunction is actually the norm. We’ve had a lot of political dysfunction in our nation’s history, and I’m not just talking about the Civil War; other times. And our country has a capacity when the country's on the line for people coming together and putting their country before their own immediate political interests. You know, a lot of members of Congress who voted for the TARP paid for it with their seats. They didn't get reelected as a result of it. And so, again, it's -- I wish I could tell you with 100 percent certainty that I know the political future. I don't, but I do have a lot of confidence in our overall system. I do have a lot of confidence that people do come together and put their country first when the stakes are this high. Very quickly. Yeah. Super-fast. Two days before TARP passed, TARP couldn't pass. The market, as Neel said before, crashed, and that forced a set of action. I think it's really hard to predict Congress. I've been watching it for a while, and it constantly surprises me, occasionally even on the upside.",2.0
against,"Well, I mean, I think, you know, each case is different . I think it makes it harder to respond, certainly in the case of democracies. And I admire Neel's contributions and his deep belief in the -- you know, how powerful our country is, but, I mean, you know, as Winston Churchill said, Americans, you know, always do the right thing after they try everything else first. And I think it might be many years of trying everything else first, in this case.",2.0
for,"Well, just imagine the cyber example that Ken talked about. Something we never thought of, it just hits us. North Korea hacks all of our banks. If North Korea hacks all of our banks, you think Republicans and Democrats aren't going to come together to save our system? If it's something like that? Of course they are. And so the more it's one of these asteroid events, the more likely our political system is going to come together and people are going to rally, because it's something none of us had thought of.",2.0
for,"We've had a lot of discussion about the political system. That's why it's so important to me that it's less likely that we're going to be in that position. Neel and I talked about five different areas, three of them indisputably safer; two of them, you could argue either side; I think largely neutral. Our opponents have tried to say we're just talking about the banking system. First of all, just talking about the banking system is just talking about the main source of crises for hundreds of years. We're also looking at derivatives, money market mutual funds, Fannie & Freddie, throughout the financial system. But I want to step back and talk about one thing that goes beyond those five arguments I think is particularly important: the Great Depression. Unemployment rate went to 25 percent, output fell 30 percent. The global financial crisis was bad; it wasn't nearly as bad as that. The unemployment rate went to 10, output fell by 5 percent. Why not? In part, it's because we made the system safer. We put in place things like deposit insurance. But we also learned a lot. And people like Ben Bernanke and Christina Romer were students of the Great Depression, and they wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. And one of the lessons they learned is, you needed to do fiscal policy, you needed to act bigger. We learned a lot from the Great Recession. Again, we didn't learn enough; we've forgotten a little bit more of it than I wish we had. But we learned a lot, and the next time we get into this, we're going to have those memories. We're -- I think we're going to act more vigorously, independently of the Fed. They're still excellent. We're going to act more vigorously on fiscal policy. And if the system isn't safe enough, it's because we need more of what we've done, not less. If you have a problem with where we are today, you need to identify how to fix it. And what I'd submit is, every single one of the fixes is, let's finish the list that we didn't get to, add to what we did, learn the lessons, and with all of that we are definitely safer today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, tonight. People often ask me, what was the financial crisis like for those of us who were there, in the middle of it? And the only way I can describe it is, it felt like we were at economic war. Every second of every day, what motivated us was trying to avoid the Great Depression scenario that Jason talked about: 25 percent unemployment. Imagine your ATM not working. Imagine you go to work, but they can't give you a paycheck. How do you then pay your bills? How do you pay your mortgage? Right? How do you -- yeah, exactly. Sorry. I didn't think about that. How do you put food on the table? So, what motivated us every second of every day was, how do we keep the system together one more day? I was working seven days a week, sleeping in my office, it went on month after month after month. And I never ever, ever want to face something like that again. For my own sake, for the country's sake, given what was at stake. Having been through that personally, I can tell you without reservation, we are better off today than we were 10 years ago. For all the reasons that we talked about. The banks, the non-banks, all the other regulatory issues. The system is just stronger and safer than it was 10 or 15 years ago. I wish, going into that crisis, that we had the tools and the capital and the systems and the structure that we have today. We didn't have it, so we had to use belts, suspenders, duct tape, everything we could think of, to try to get through that crisis. And we got through it, but we're better off today. And for that reason, Jason and I very respectfully are asking for your vote in favor of them motion. Thank you very much.",3.0
against,"So our -- thank you. Our esteemed opponents, I think, have made a lot of good points, but they wanted to frame the question, not, are we safe, but, are we safer? I don’t actually think that’s the right way to look at it. I’d say thanks to actions of theirs and some of the people we’ve talked about and under President Obama’s administration, we are safer than we would be had they not taken those actions, but it doesn’t mean that the system which has grown inexorably larger, more internationalized problems in other places is necessarily safer than it would be otherwise. And we were asked, well, what would you do? And I’m going to state what Bob said a little bit differently, but there is a wonderful book by Anat Admati at Stanford and Martin Hellwig, who is Swiss, called the “Bankers’ New Clothes”; I highly recommend it do you. And they basically make the argument that you should have banks have much more of their own skin in the game, and in response to others, twice as much equity as there used to be, Anat’s response to that is, you know, twice nothing is still nothing; there’s very little, and another analogy she uses is, okay, we used to have trucks loaded with stuff travelling at 100 miles per hour. Now there’s trucks loaded with more stuff and they’re only driving at 95 miles an hour, but it’s not a very safe system. I wish I could tell you, you know, that you should sleep better at night, but I don’t -- I’m afraid that we live in this very uncertain world, and I have to come back to the Trump argument, which is simply, we don’t have a safe pair of hands. I wouldn’t feel good in any kind of crisis. Thank you and -- thank you.",3.0
for,"Well, the big surprise we've had is, we kept thinking that we're at maximum employment. Everybody who wants to work is able to find a job, but then month after month, all these Americans are coming off the sidelines. I want to see evidence that we're actually there -- wage growth picks up, we really know that, ""Okay, we're finally at maximum employment"" and then that leads to inflation. So I'm not opposed to rate hikes, ever. But I want to see evidence that the U.S. economy is finally hitting on all cylinders. Everybody is able to find a job who wants to find a job. When that happens, it'll be time for me to then go ahead and raise rates. Thank you.",3.0
