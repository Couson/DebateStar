for,"Thank you so much. David and I are here to convince you that indeed the two-party system has rendered this country ungovernable. And the evidence is all around us. Wherever you look you see that we can only produce suboptimal solutions to our deepest crisis. And if you have any doubt about that just look around. Why do we still have banks that we have deemed to be too big to fail? Why did our two-party system produce three major disasters in recent years? The financial meltdown, the mining disaster that left 29 miners dead in West Virginia, the BP oil spill, just to mention three major disasters, that were produced as a result of our completely dysfunctional two-party system. And, you know, for many, many years we’ve kind of postponed solving our big problems, we’ve postponed dealing with our deficit, we've postponed dealing with the decline of the middleclass, we've postponed dealing with our crumbling infrastructure, we've postponed dealing with our deteriorating education system. Well, we can no longer keep postponing dealing with these problems. So while the two-party system might have been okay during the ordinary times, we’re not living in ordinary times right now. We actually have to solve our problems, we have no more reserves, we’ve run out of time, the chickens have come home to roost. And the problem with the two-party system is that is has made us all prisoners of conventional wisdom. It’s made us look at every political problem through that obsolete prism of right versus left. In fact our political problems are not susceptible to that easy completely reductionist way of looking at them. Let’s take Afghanistan, the media consider anybody who wants to leave Afghanistan as a lefty. In fact George Will, the Cato Institute, Pat Buchanan, Joe Scarborough, and many conservative intellectuals see no reason for us to be pursuing an unwinnable war at huge expense. Let’s look at reforming Wall Street. There are many good capitalists who sleep with a copy of Ayn Rand’s books under their pillow, who believe that Wall Street desperately needs reforming if it’s going to actually operate like a capitalist system as opposed to operating like an oligarchy, crony, system where losses are socialized and gains are privatized. Nevertheless the two-party system makes that kind of thinking impossible because we continue to see everything through that obsolete binary prism. But look around, the favorability ratings of the two parties are constantly declining. We now have Dems at about 39 percent favorability rating and Republicans at 34 percent. And the last election despite all the attention, despite all the media hoopla only 42 percent of the electorate voted. This is an enormous amount of dissatisfaction in the political system to have so many people not even participating in that most elementary duty of citizenship voting. And then let’s look at what would have happened in any other section of our life if we had such a vacuum. There would have been more competition; there would have been more participation from others, but not in our political system. Indeed inordinate amounts of power is folded in the hands of a few so-called centrist senators, like Olympia Snowe, do you remember during the healthcare debate for 14 months Democrats did everything they could to woo Olympia Snowe. They are like lovelorn high schoolers who are just not getting the message that she was just not into them. And John Adams predicted what would happen when he said that “there is nothing I dread so much as a division of the Republic into two great parties each arranged under its leader and converting measures in opposition to each other.” But that’s exactly what we have done. And the hunger for change is overwhelming. The election of Barack Obama is evidence of that, the rise of the Tea Party is evidence of that. There is huge mistrust of our national institutions, politicians, business people, the media. And the rise of social media, the rise of the Internet has made it possible for young people especially to connect with each other, to reject the existing system, to opt out of politics and try to find solutions in their own communities, bypassing the political system. That’s not ultimately healthy because democracy is not a spectator sport. And if we’re going to revive democracy, if we’re going to overcome all the obstacles in the way of a truly Democratic system, you know, the way we have the huge advantages of incumbency, the difficulty of ballot access, the gerrymandering of our districts. If we’re going to overcome all these things, we need to actually bring more competition and more voices and fresh thinking to our political system. Because as Einstein put it, to paraphrase him, the problems we are facing right now cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them. And that’s all that the two parties are capable of. So, let me just end by quoting Thomas Jefferson. In a letter to Francis Hopkinson, he said, “I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of man whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else, while I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go to Heaven at all.” Well, it’s here that our two-party system is not taking us to Heaven. In fact, it’s rapidly taking us in the other direction. Thank you. Wisdom. Arianna, I can't explain. So the defender of the two-party system starts out by conceding that parties are cowardly, ineffectual and stupid and so stands by the proposition that we can't do any better, which is good counter programming toward Obama standing on a position of hopelessness and changelessness, more or less standing up for the ""Let's go suck on a gas pipe"" party. And I suggest you support P.J. if you have Jack Kevorkian on your speed dial, that we can't do any better. But then in the middle of his remarks, a sort of miracle occurs, and after telling us how stupid the parties are, suddenly he decides they are about to reconstitute themselves into something not half bad. P.J. and I are old friends, and I know he took a lot of drugs in the '60s. Call Rockefeller University. Apparently, they're still hanging around. Now, Arianna spoke about the broad dysfunction of our parties. I'm going to speak about the narrow dysfunction, especially in Washington where I cover it. I cover politicians very closely. And I can tell you, from this context, politicians are all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I call logorrhea dementia, which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. But they do have these intense social antennae so they, if you meet them, they will guarantee to invade your personal space. They'll stand too close, rub the back of your head. I was campaigning with Mitt Romney up in New Hampshire once, and he was campaigning in a diner with his five perfect sons, Bip, Chip, Rip, Lip, Sip and Dip. And we go in the diner. He introduces himself to a family and then says, “What village in New Hampshire are you from?” And then he describes the home he owned in their village. And then he goes around the diner and then first-names everybody on the way out. So they're weird social creatures. Nonetheless, I would say in general, they are better people than one would anticipate. Most of them are in it for the right reason, but they're stuck in a rotten system. They're stuck in our current two-party system which forces them to behave in ways that are worse than they are. It's a mind suck. First of all, they cannot be entrepreneurial. They cannot think for themselves because they have to hew the party line. They get -- every Tuesday. They go to a lunch. They get the message of the week. They have to parrot the message of the week. It's a soul suck. They can't behave nicely or even get to know the people in the other party because there are unofficial barriers. I went to something called the Civility Conference where Annenberg took House members from both parties to the Green Briar Hotel and got them to work together, or to meet together. And I went to the dining room. It was like junior high, all the Republicans over here, all the Democrats over here. They know nothing about each other. When a member of a party starts describing to me the -- what's going to happen on the other side, I know everything they're about to tell me is wrong because they know nothing about each other. Finally, it's freedom destroying. They come in wanting to cut deals, talking in private about what they'd like to achieve. But they're in a tribal mentality in what -- what they can achieve is severely limited by the tribal sort of Tutsi versus Hutu nature of our politics of the current two-party system. So as a result, they find themselves unable to lead the lives they'd like to lead. Arianna talked about how the big problems are therefore not addressed because they are stuck in these little trenches. These problems come up every day, the squeezing of the middle class unaddressed. I would talk about today's story, the issue of the budget. We are facing a fiscal meltdown in this country. And if you took individuals outside the party context that we have now, I bet we could all cut a deal. We could figure out what taxes needed to go up and what spending needs to go down. But we're stuck in this dysfunctional marriage where, first of all, 85 percent of the budget is completely off the table because neither party wants to touch it. Secondly, you've got the Republicans who at least have big ideas for cutting the spending. But they have no idea what spending should be cut and what isn't, so they're cutting some of our most valuable programs like Head Start and early childhood education because that's the party dogma. Then on the Democrat side, they've got some decent ideas to save Head Start and early childhood education. But the present -- the Democrats have no persuasive ideas so we can actually cut the budget deficit and avoid national bankruptcy by 2015 or 2019. In 2019, we will be paying interest on the debt equal to about 800, $900 billion. And this problem has been building and building and building. We are completely unable to solve it because the Republicans refuse to raise taxes, which is going to have to happen, the Democrats refuse to talk about Medicare and Social Security reductions, which are going to have to happen. We are stuck and we are heading toward a national disaster. So the first thing we need to do is get out of the system where we’re stuck in these party ruts. The University of Maryland had a very interesting study where they took Tea Party people, they took liberals, and they said, “Here’s our budget problem, you deal with it.” And the Tea Party people acknowledged that they had to raise taxes, the people on the far left acknowledged some spending had to be cut. They all could do it. But the two-party system can’t do it. The second thing we have to do is mobilize independence. We probably need a third party, but we certainly need a dealignment, we need more movements to come in and affect the parties so people are less hewn to these tribal parties and that’s what the parties have become, they’ve become tribes, almost ethnic tribes. They are no longer the normal political groupings that they were 20 or 30 years ago. They’ve become tribes where your honor is attached to your tribe and any compromise seems like a sign of shame and dishonor and therefore they’re not willing to do it. So we need to get more movements involved, take up the two parties. And then finally we need a philosophy, we’ve got two parties in this country, but we’ve got three movements. The first movement is a liberal movement that believes in using government to enhance equality. The second movement is a conservative movement that believes in limited government to enhance freedom. But starting at the foundation of our Republic there was a movement starting with Alexander Hamilton going up to Abraham Lincoln going up to Teddy Roosevelt which believed in limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility, to give people the tools to compete. This is not big government, it’s not little government, it’s energetic government to give people the tools to thrive in a capitalist economy. That centrist movement is completely unrepresented by the two parties and yet it’s where the largest percentage of Americans are. So if you think, if you take a look at the fiscal situation, if you take a look at some of these big issues and you can see our current two-party system leading to a solution in the near term, you can vote for those guys, but if you can’t see a plausible way out of our problems I suggest you vote for us, thank you.",1.0
against,"Great. I'd like to begin by quoting something that I saw in the press just the other day, ""Things haven't been moving in Washington, a young Democratic president with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress can't get much of anything passed except for defense and appropriations, which certainly doesn't add up to dynamism, a sense of delusion has set in among friends as well as foes."" That, from Time Magazine, September 7th, 1962, and the young president they're talking about is John F. Kennedy. And the point that I'd like to begin with is that people always say and have always said that America is ungovernable and that these are times as Arianna put it which are extraordinary, different than other times, and require extraordinary and brand new solutions. But America has always been in unusual times. That's how it always seems to people when they're alive, that they're living in unprecedented times. In the 1920s, America confronted Prohibition which made it seem that the country was ungovernable and also, you know, no place to get a drink. In the 1930s, there was a depression in this country which was far worse than the economic situation today obviously. In the 1940s, America was able to mobilize itself to go to war against Nazi Germany and Japan even though there was a strong sentiment in this country not to go to war, an America First Sentiment, which was overcome. In the 1950s, we all -- those of us who are old enough to remember, used to hide under our desks in the nuclear drills because we were sure that we were going to get bombed by the Russians. But, in the event, America won the Cold War. In the 1960s, the halcyon days of our youth -- my team anyway -- -- we not only were living in an ungovernable society, but we were contributing to it, and happily. The 1970s were Watergate, a disaster. It was the end of American democracy. The president was forced to step down, never happened before. Somehow the country survived those extraordinary times. And what brought it through each time was the two-party system, which is a stable and consistent system in this country. It’s what provides stability for the United States, politically speaking. The 1980s -- anybody -- some of you remember the 1980s, it looks like. That was the decade that Japan was going to take over and dwarf the American economy, something like the Chinese. And, by the way, the Japanese growth national product per capita is less than America’s today. And then, of course, we’re living in New York, the ungovernable city, as it was called by Nathan Glazer in 1961, and as it was referred to by others before Rudy Giuliani became mayor. And if you look out the window, those of you who came here today, you don’t see an ungovernable city. You see a well governed city, both under Giuliani and also under Bloomberg. This was a miracle, but here we are. The American system is a resilient system. And the notion that this country’s ungovernable is a media trope. It’s not true. It hasn’t been true. I can prove it to you, if you want, with statistics. The World -- is it the World Bank? I’m not too good at my notes here. Because they’re in Hebrew and who can read -- You know, seriously, I’m reading backwards. It’s not funny. I had some -- actually, I did have some great statistics. I thought I was going to impress David Brooks with them, but you’ll have to take my -- oh, here it is. Okay, the World Bank index -- it has a thing called the Index of Governability, which is so handy for a debate like this. And I just looked it up. You know, why argue when you can have fact-based, evidence-based arguements. All right. The World Bank takes into account one, two, three, four, five metrics. Accountability and voice, which goes to what Arianna was discussing, effectiveness of the government, the quality of regulation, the rule of law, and the control of corruption -- in all of those indices, the United States scored above the 90th percentile in the world, which is an “A,” even at NYU. And only in public stability, which is a function of terrorism, does it get a “B.” In other words, the American system is a -- if you say compared to what? Compared to utopia, it’s a replaceable system. If you compare it to the rest of the systems of the world, it’s a pretty good system. And, as P.J. said, it’s also the system that fits this country. It was built for this country. And it has lasted a very long time. Back in the day, there was a columnist that we grew up on, Walter Lippmann. And here’s what he wrote, and I like to close with it. This is about force of representation, proportional voting, but it stands for the system in general. He said that “the objection that popular government cannot be conducted without the two-party system is, I believe, refuted by the experience of Europe.” “If I had to choose between a congressional caucus and a coalition ministry, I should not have to hesitate very long.” That was written in 1914, the year that World War I began inexplicably. And I would say that if you look at that system, the European system and the American system, which are the only two real Democratic systems in the world, the American system has done pretty well in the last 80 years. And I think it's a -- Thank you. I wrote -- I write the quotes for both of us. P.J. O’Rourke: Yeah, yeah. Washington warned against the spirit of party, period. He didn't go so far as to just worry about two. He worried about the system of party absolutely. And I would say that Americans have taken that to heart, that while there are core Democratic and Republican supporters, and while they probably have more influence over our political system than they ought to, that Americans themselves have always been a bit dubious about both of the major political tendencies. And there is no golden period that we can go back to in American history to find, you know, some sort of political system that would be better for us. The original divide between Jeffersonian Democrats and the Federalists, the Jeffersonian Democrats were an unholy alliance of New York demagogues -- New York demagogues, who would imagine? -- New York demagogues who favored the French revolution and all the fun they were having in France and Southern slave owners who favored states' rights. Meanwhile, the supposedly more respectable Federalists were the authors of the alien -- naturalization alien and sedition acts and the first major political witch hunt in the United States. I think Americans have always been quite aware that both parties stink.",1.0
for,"You know, P.J., I would argue that if we really had -- believed what you believe now throughout the course of American history, we would never have made any moves towards a more perfect union because when we had slavery, you would say, oh, it's as good as it gets. When women didn't have the vote, you would say, well, you know, it could have been worse. When we didn't have -- when African-Americans could not vote, you would say, well, you know, just think of it. In other countries, it's just infinitely worse, and the World Bank probably would have given us an “A” rating. But -- That World Bank “A” rating really worries me. It must have been the same kind of credit -- credit rating agencies that were giving junk bonds AAA ratings. So, you know, the idea that we're not living through unprecedented times, you know, is an unbelievably elitist idea that stems -- P.J. O’Rourke: But you see, Arianna -- No, no. Let me just finish. P.J. O’Rourke: Okay. Because this is like from people who are comfortable like we are privileged to be, those of us here on the stage. But just look at what's happening. A hundred million Americans right now are worse off than their parents were -- And also that throughout our history, we've always aimed to do better. We believe that we can do better.",1.0
against,"Well, I think that Arianna put it very -- very well. There was a time when there was slavery. And there was a time when women couldn't vote. And there was a time when African-Americans couldn't -- when African-Americans couldn't vote. And all those things no longer are the case. They all changed. And they all changed under the twoparty system, which is the subject that we're debating tonight. The fact that there are imperfections in America is obvious. And the fact that there are people in America who are suffering is a constant.",1.0
for,"Because it wasn't always thus. If you go back to, say, 30 years ago, and you look at the two parties. In the first place, the two parties overlapped in Congress. Now they do not. There's no common ground between them. In the second place, if you look at the things they were able to do, like tax reform in 1986, you had a whole series of bipartisan agreements. If you cover Congress the way I do, you had, in those days, a whole series of personal relationships. That simply doesn't exist. And that's what -- No. There was a period of constructive competition. They fought. Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton. I would write that as highly polarizing. But they fought to balance each other's weaknesses. And now they don't -- they don't -- they fight to stagnate. Well, we are arguing for something that will shake up the current dysfunctional system. P.J. O’Rourke: But what? But what? I don't want the garden gnome party holding the balance of power. I thought that was Michael Dukakis. Yeah. Your notes are in Hebrew and mine are in Greek so we all have a problem. But the truth of the moment is that as an immigrant to this country who has lived the American dream. I'm fully aware of the fact that the American dream is dying for millions of Americans. And I have two daughters in college. And a growing number of their friends are graduating from college, and they can't get jobs. We have 26 million Americans at the moment who are either unemployed or underemployed. And we don't have any plan that the two parties seem to be capable of, of how to bring jobs about. So there is a huge dysfunctionality. And the results are really incredibly profound. I mean, they are changing the nature of this country. Upward mobility has been at the heart of the American dream. Now we are number ten when it comes to upward mobility. We are behind France and Germany. Excuse me, but being behind France in upward mobility is like France being behind us in croissants and afternoon sex. Well, the idea that it’s dumb kids that are the problem is just charming P.J. I mean, whatever P.J. says, he's charming because he's funny. But it's not true.",1.0
against,"Well, I would say not true is -- that's pretty definitive. The notion of being in a debate with Arianna Huffington arguing that America has lost its ability to have upward mobility is a startling experience. And I want to say something about David's notion about bipartisanship. Two things quickly, first of all, polarization is a good thing, not a bad thing. In countries where you don't have polarized political debate, you have no debate. Severity does not equal democracy. And in the many countries that I've visited, and you've all visited and been to and I’m sure many of you where you haven’t heard harsh debate, you have been in the countries that are being ruled, not in Democratic ways and societies that are open. And the other thing about this golden age of advise and consent when all the Congressmen got together, the Senators got together and had cocktails and so on, and there’s no bipartisanship anymore, I just want to say the following words, No Child Left Behind which was passed in a bipartisan way, the Medicaid prescription -- Medicare prescription, the tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts, the Iraq War which like it or not was a bipartisan affair, the TARP stuff, the healthcare bill which was passed in a – a monopartisan way-- -- all of these things have been passed in the last 10 years.",1.0

And I’m fine with that as long as it’s constructive. The problem is we have parties that don’t represent the country. We now have, here’s a fact from Morris Fiorina, Stanford political scientist, more people own ferrets than watch Fox News. And so, but we have a party -- P.J. O’Rourke: Isn't there a lot of overlap? That's a good point, yeah. Glenn Beck’s ferret is loose. But we have a party that’s sort of dictated by that small group, and in the Democratic party we have a party dictated by the public sector employee unions. And you’ve got vast numbers of people whose views are not basically represented, so the country is still a bell curve country, and the rest of the -- and the two-party system is not. And therefore you don’t have -- A bell curve is like this, most people in the middle.

And the Democrats nominated Barack Obama who was the soul of reasonableness, and so much is in favor of civility that he said at my alma mater, the University of Michigan, “If you are people who listen to Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, then read some articles on the Huffington Post.” That's what you have. Those are the two leaders of the major parties at least until the next election. I don't think that you can make the case that these are extremists who don't talk to one another or who are civil with one another.",1.0
for,"Compare pre-nomination John McCain to post-nomination John McCain and see what a guy has to do to get elected. I think Americans don't believe that our current -- Oh, sorry. Americans don't believe that our current political system is working. That's why you have 37 percent of Americans who are registered as independents because they don't believe our current two-party system is delivering what the country needs. And increasingly young people who really do want to find solutions to our problems are choosing civic engagement instead of political engagement. Who have long waiting lists for people to join teach for America, so it's not as if they've given up on making the world better. I mean, P.J. and Zev may have given up on making the world better but -- -- young people haven't, they just don't see the political route through the two-party system as the way to make the world better, but if we give up on making the world better then we might as well give up on everything. You know, I mean, I think in the end Churchill was right, he said Americans can be counted to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other possibility. And the two-party system is one of the other possibilities we have now exhausted. Exactly. P.J. O’Rourke: Well fine -- Well, first of all, let me just say that the motion is “The two-party system is making American ungovernable.” And I hope you’ve all heard our opponents make our case again and again and again. In fact, P.J. just said, it’s not good right now, but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to get better. Absolutely. All we are saying is that we need to take steps to make it better. We can’t just wait by the sidelines and expect it to get better. And the fastest way to make it better is to shake up a dysfunctional and stagnant twoparty system. That’s all we have to prove. That’s all we are arguing. Well, the primary way is to allow more competition. All of us believe in competition, right? It’s the essence of a private enterprise, freedombased system. We believe in competition in everything except politics. When it comes to politics, you’ve got to pick your party and run with your party, and actually espouse whatever the party stands for at that particular moment. One election cycle, it may be abortion or no abortion -- the social issues, this election cycle, and it’s around issues that have to do with the shrinking government on the Republican side. So, that’s not the way to fundamentally change the conditions we are all living under.",1.0
against,"I don’t -- I’m with P.J. We’re talking about a two-party system in an actual world, or a different political system in an actual world. The two-party system is a very long-standing -- and by the way, it has plenty of room for Independents, which are part of the system, and also for third-party candidates, which are a function of every election, whether it’s Ross Perot or whether it’s Pat Buchanan, or you can’t name an election -- or Henry Wallace, or George Wallace or -- you can’t name an election that hasn’t had a third-party candidate or more -- P.J. O’Rourke: Or usually a big nut. The fact that people don’t want to vote for them is not the same thing as saying that they don’t exist. And I think that we have to -- since we’re talking about reality and not utopia, I think we have to ask ourselves, who, on this stage, the four of us -- the three of you are all brilliant, and John, of course, is also. If the five of us, and I’m just old -- I have more age. I’m older than P.J. by a couple of months, so I have seniority. But if the five of us had to sit down and devise a better political system, even with the wizards on this panel, I don’t think we would be able to do it. And even if the whole audience participated, we probably might not get there. We have a political -- there is a political system in this country, and thank God there is.

for,"First, I'm not necessarily for realignment, but de-alignment. We're seeing all sorts of social movements that are growing up organically like the Tea party, like the Obama movement, like Move On. I'd like to see a lot more of those movements in order to loosen up the parties. And the second thing, I do think there has been an historical tradition, which I talked about, from Hamilton to Lincoln and maybe to moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats today, the very few that exist. That tradition is unrepresented by our politics. And I think that long American historic tradition deserves a voice. So those would be two things I'd change. And I would add that -- -- movement politics really leads us to what I call Hope 2.0. You know, if Obama was about hope, which is just basically hope being channeled to one of the two parties. Hope 2.0 is about hope being channeled to multiple movements, a community solution, people all around the country unleashing an enormous amount of creativity and ingenuity around finding solutions at the local level. We in the media are doing a lousy job of putting a spotlight on what is working. We need to do a much better job. We need to help them scale up. And this is really part of what we are talking about. No, I think -- I think to a large extent the parties use movements during election times. I mean, look at the Obama movement. Once Obama was in the White House, he basically disappeared. They are now trying to reconstitute it because he is beginning to run for the election. That's not what makes a thriving movement. A movement is something which organically continues to grow through elections and beyond them. And that's what we need more of. People do not trust establishments. I mean, look at the tea party movement. It's fundamentally anti-establishment. Look at what's happening among young people on the Democrat side, fundamentally antiestablishment. The numbers of mistrust when it comes to our national institutions has skyrocketed. We need to address that. Otherwise we are becoming an increasingly dysfunctional society.",1.0
against,"Well, first of all, I want to take issue with the characterization of the Obama movement. Obama was the nominee of the Democratic party. He wasn't a movement candidate. He was a candidate of one of the two major parties. Had he been only a movement candidate, he would have gotten three percent of the vote or five percent of the vote or whatever movement candidates get. But he went through the system, and he's a part of the system. As far as the notion of young people speaking their minds and getting so much resistance from behind. We're talk -- that's not a good idea, Arianna. Really, it's not. It's great for everybody to participate. And I'm glad that there's an Internet and all of the cool stuff that we've got these days in participatory Facebook and all the rest of it. But since everybody's quoting the founding fathers, John Adams also said that political parties are there to govern passion. And something needs to govern the un-channeled passions of all of the marvelous passion that kids have and young people have and disaffected people have and anti-establishmentarian people have, and they all can exist within the framework of the two-party system as they have ever since 1865, whenever the Civil War ended, in my opinion.",1.0
for,"Yeah, I completely agree with you. And if you look, for example, at the way the media describes our political problems, it’s reflexively through that prism of right versus left. I mean, I mentioned Afghanistan in my opening statement, Wall Street reform, unemployment. Why is it left wing to care about helping people get jobs? And yet that's how it's portrayed in the media. But if you look at how the discussion is, say, on social media, it's very different. Does not accept those very stale distinctions. So we have a responsibility, those of us in the media and everybody else, to participate in that and change it. And increasingly, more and more, people are participating, and selfexpression has become a kind of form of self-fulfillment. More people are participating, uploading videos. We saw it not just here. We saw it in what happened in Egypt recently. We saw a phenomenal outpouring of something which I suppose you might regard dangerous because it's leading to uncontrollable passions. But it's also leading to freedom, liberation and other things that uncontrollable passions provide.",1.0

for,"Fighting is the norm. Polarization like we've seen is not the norm. This is actually statistically demonstrable. Political scientists take a look at how many votes cross party lines, how many times in each Congress people actually reach bipartisan deals. And the number now is at all time lows, it's cycled through history, but it’s never been like this. People fought Lyndon Johnson in the '60s, fought -- but Lyndon Johnson was able to fashion coalitions. Henry Clay, people then fought, they were able to fashion coalitions. The problem is not that they were fighting. I’m all for fighting, the problem is that each party has become more rigid in my own lifetime of covering this stuff. When I came to Washington in the early '80s I could go to back benchers like Jack Kemp or Newt Gingrich on the Republican side, they had all these weird ideas they were trying to push on leadership. That doesn’t happen, the leaders control everything now. The nature of the parties has changed. Yes. Absolutely, I think that’s a very important point and especially with the citizens' united decision. As you said we see the stronghold of money on our political system, the power of special interest, the fact that we have dozens of lobbyists per member of Congress, the fact that even when good legislation is passed it’s undermined at the committee stage. All those things have made us ungovernable, because even when -- and we have mining reform for example, then you go back and you look at how it was all watered down to the point where the Virginia mining disaster could happen. Even when you have regulators living inside Lehman Brothers or Fannie and Freddie, they were not able to prevent the regulator recapture that allowed the financial meltdown to happen. I mean we have lost trillions in private wealth. We have the greatest increase in poverty in the suburbs at the moment. We are becoming a third world country and if we don’t pay attention now, if we don’t do something where they stand to course correct then it’s going to be too late. And that’s why this is the time to sound the alarm, recognize it to have become ungovernable and change the system. I guess I would say -- - I was born in Canada, bula bula. You know, I'm actually not sure that's it because members of Congress fly home every weekend. That's one of the reasons their lives are so miserable and they hold town meetings. And a lot of places -- I meant the flight, not the getting there -- they hold town meetings and if they can get 30 or 50 people to show up they're happy, they love to meet people, they spend a lot of time meeting people. And as I said they have this you and I need food and water, they just need social love, that's what they need. And so I don't think that's it. I don't think it's when they go home that the problem is, I think it's when they come to Washington and are surrounded by a psychological vortex. I just wanted to make that explicit. I think the psychology within the parties has changed -- John Donvan: David Brooks. -- just another role is non-party primaries. I mean, if you look at the most disaffected people, they’re not actually where Nader is or not where Libertarians are. They’re in the middle 37 percent of the country basically feels disaffected. But they have no candidates to vote for in general elections because they’re just not offered them. And if you had non-party primaries, you’d have a better shot they’d have a voice.",1.0
against,"Yeah, and in multi-party systems, there are many people who also don’t feel that they’re representing by any of the parties. And I, having lived in a country that has 14 parties, I can tell you that I didn't find any that represented me. That's an inherent problem of democracy. If you have a party that fits the taste of every person or every group of people, you'll have hundreds or a multiplicity of parties that makes it impossible to govern. And if you have any system, whether it's a two-party system or a proportional representational system or a different kind of parliamentary system, I assure you -- and I've lived through this. I'm telling you from personal experience -- that professional politicians will always find a way to game whatever reform you make in the electoral system because they're better at it than you are and I am. That's what they do for a living. P.J. O’Rourke: Exactly. And therefore I think that if you have something that is open to everyone, anybody can vote in this country. Anybody can join a party in this country. Anybody could run for office in this country. That's great. If, as P.J. says, many people aren't interested, then they're not interested.

And so he thought, well, you know -- and there were a lot of people who were disaffected. So could I win? And then he said, well, I could win some states, probably not all of them, but I could win some. And then it would get thrown into the House of Representatives, a body staffed entirely by Republicans and Democrats. There's no way they're going to vote for me. And so he was dissuaded from running as a third-party candidate by the fact that the two parties have a stranglehold on the presidential process.",1.0

And I sometimes go on TV shows, and the TV shows I happen to go on are some of the best on TV, the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, which is much less partisan shouting than most. And yet the shows all of us are on, you are either the Republican seat or the Democratic seat. And I consider myself Hamiltonian, like I've been saying, which fits very awkwardly with the current Republican party. And yet that's my seat. That's my role. That's what I play on TV. And so it's sometimes frustrating. I can imagine for people further outside one of those parties, it's frustrating because you're put into that slot. And I've been very struck by -- I think when I started doing this, people would say, “Are you conservative or liberal?” Now people come up to me, “Are you a Republican or Democrat?” The label Republican or Democrat has sup planted conservative or liberal. It's not what you believe. It's what team you're on. And that's part of -- P.J. O’Rourke: -- feel that. I happen to be a Republican, but I am primarily a Libertarian conservative and when I go on shows, not quite the same quality of shows as David goes on-- -- my place -- I'm on Bill Maher -- my place is there as a sort of a kooky Libertarian conservative, a guy who's really, really conservative, really, really Republican, but thinks about marijuana, it’s a drug that makes teenage boys drive slow and what’s wrong with that? -- and so I think that there are broader categories than merely Democratic and Republican.",1.0

It can offer ways to express yourself in the media, in new media, old media, on the street corner, in groups, however you want to do it, and politically within organized parties.

And if that third party isn’t wearing a shirt, they really should do a background check. Because he might turn out to be a member of Congress, and you don’t want to go there. So, I remember in 2000 I organized a shadow convention. The shadow conventions were intended to address issues that the two political parties were not addressing. And those issues were the growing income inequalities, the failed war on drugs that has put more African Americans in jail than that have jobs at the moment, and also the problem that was addressed here tonight of campaign financial reform and the desperate need to do that. Since 2000, all these problems have gotten worse, and they have gotten worse because the two-party system has made this country ungovernable. And unless you give up on the idea of America becoming a more perfect union. Unless you give up on the idea of us being able to really live up to the American dream of our ancestors, then you’ve got to vote with David and me.",3.0
against,"Ninety-nine years ago, a guy stood up at a political convention, a third-party convention, and he said, “We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord.” That was Teddy Roosevelt. “Armageddon” was Woodrow Wilson. It’s always Armageddon for people who have that tendency, and it’s good that there are people who think it’s Armageddon because they push. That’s a good thing. I support that. I’m in favor of it. There’s a place for it in the political parties. But tonight we’re talking about a specific motion, which is that the two-party system is making American ungovernable. In order for you to vote for that, you have to agree to two things. You have to agree that America is becoming ungovernable, or perhaps it is already, as Arianna said in the beginning, has become ungovernable. I don’t think that that’s the case. I don’t think that any of you who came here today by car, by bus, by train, by plane, however you got here, travelled through a space which anyone could regard as ungovernable. American is a highly governed country. It has flaws, it has problems, it has economic inequalities -- all of these things have existed, and they’ll continue to exist. They’re part of the human condition. America needs to be a more perfect society; it can’t be a perfect society because no society is perfect. The second proposition that you have to agree to, even if you think that the world and America as you know it is ungovernable -- ungovernable! -- you have to believe that the reason that it’s ungovernable, that the BP disaster took place and the Virginia mining disaster took place, and all the other disasters took place because of the two-party system. And I don’t really think that you can make that case. And therefore, I implore you to vote for our side.",3.0
for,"Many of you have been looking at our side, at our table, and thought “Those two are so much alike.” Arianna’s a glamorous woman with continental manners. I aspire to be the fittest fat person in America. Arianna created a business in which people write for free, and she sold it for more than $300 million. I have three credit cards, one of which I can use at any time. Throughout this entire debate, she’s been texting Matt Damon and Fergie. I’ve seen “The Bourne Identity.” Arianna and I agree on most things. In fact, I think I can safely say I agree with Zev and P.J. a lot more than I agree with Arianna. And yet if Arianna and I sat in a room and talked about the big issues facing our country, I bet we could reach some plausible solutions. But if we were elected to the two parties as they currently exist, we would never get in the same room because those two parties have gotten much more rigid. So when I take a look at the issues that are before us, and those issues have been alighted I think during this debate: Immigration, a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement; debt, a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement. Wage stagnation and inequality, a long-growing issue about which the two parties can reach no agreements; campaign finance. I could go on. These are all concrete issues that are right here in front of us. If you see a way for our current two-party system -- if you see an avenue for them to reach agreement and solutions on these issues, even in perfect solutions, well, then vote for the guys in the red ties. But if you don't, vote for the glamorous side. Thank you.",3.0
