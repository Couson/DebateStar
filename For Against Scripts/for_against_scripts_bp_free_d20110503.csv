for,"That's right. Well, I will be happy to answer that. Let me first tell you that I must say in response to your discussion about the title of this debate, about the proposition itself, I was a little bit uptight about it originally because, after all, we are debating this issue here in New York City a few miles from Ellis Island. And I have been -- I have participated in things in the past that have been a little bit skewed, and I can recall a spoof of me, a debate -- or actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and Vincente Fox, but it was a spoof on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and so they had someone who looked like -- and I knew it was biased from the beginning, from the very beginning because the guy playing me looked like me and the guy playing Vincente Fox was Antonio Banderas -- No fair, come on, guys. Frankly, I -- you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration, both legal and illegal, and they are fascinating. It is really one of the most intellectually stimulating areas of public policy I think we can possibly talk about. A great deal of mythology has built up around the Statue of Liberty, around the Emma Lazarus poem, and a lot of that mythology, of course, is just that. It's mythology. But unfortunately we have a tendency in the United States, we look back sort of nostalgically at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of immigrants, and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us, and that's our first thought usually. And I am the same way. I am the grandson of Italian immigrants, came right here into Ellis Island. And my parents being first generation Americans were very, very strict about one thing and that was to become an American, to become -- and it meant a lot of things to them in different ways, and I'll get to it in a minute, except that I do want you to understand I have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was, but we can't confuse that and make -- and develop true policy today based on mythology and, you know, some of the myths that we have to dispel. I think tonight's a good place to do it, it’s -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration. Indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy. It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic. In fact, the statue was called “Liberty Enlightening the World.” It was not called “Liberty Inviting the World.” As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 years after the statue got here. And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups. Remember also that a lot of the tired, and poor, and huddled masses got stamped “return to sender"" here at Ellis Island. There were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at Ellis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get you sent home. It was not a take all comers time in American history. As for the poor, well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy. In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, ""A visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit."" In 1996 in the Congress of the United States, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if you’re coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support. They put it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it been enforced. And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degree of poverty into the United States. The National Academy of Sciences along with the Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households. Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to American taxpayers of over $150 billion annually. Now, my point here is to show that for a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, and believe, is a rational policy. It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especiallyduring the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who were low-skill, low-wage people.  Because, of course, we were building the Industrial Revolution here. They were fueling it. That was appropriate. It was right. It served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here. I hope -- well, also, as I see we’re getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is another myth I want to try to dispel quickly. And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time America started until today, that it’s always just been going up. Absolutely untrue. About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States. It started to climb. By 1850, it started to go down. Around 1880, it grew. Around 1890, it declined. It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramatically after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924. It stayed relatively low for a long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator Teddy Kennedy. And we’ve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers ever since that period of time. Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not. It had and served a good purpose, I think. We had periods of high immigration. We had periods of low immigration. And you know what happened during the periods of low immigration? People used that time to assimilate. And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most important aspect of the debate. Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially, as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it. Or, if it doesn’t happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not occurring. It’s not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you can’t categorically say that, but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country. We desperately need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to think about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart. And I’m afraid our immigration policy is doing just that.  Well, I'm making plenty of noise there too.  My work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department. And after I left the Justice Department in 2003, I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it. But it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level. And that's why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states. In 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state. Not all of them passed, but that's an important point. Every state is a border state now. The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold. But the number one driver is a very important point in this debate, and I'd like to start there. The fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable. My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman. He said, it's just obvious. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state. Now, my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience. I am not a big fan myself, I accept the reality that it's here to stay. And given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration. They were not immigrating into a welfare state. They were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits. There was no safety net to catch them. That is a critical distinction that changes everything. When Emma Lazarus wrote that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door. Now, the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity. You come here, you're free to do whatever you can. You make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you. Now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western hemisphere. The golden door represents something completely different. Now, aliens are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so. Now, the average per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits, is estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net. They're consuming -- and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined. 19,400 per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes. So that's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country. Now, Julián mentioned this 1993 study. I have not seen that study. That is so old I wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then. Now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country. There was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was generated by the Center for Immigration Studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare. Now, the explanation for this is obvious. It has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics. Poor people are more likely to consume welfare. And immigrants coming into the United States, especially illegal immigrants, are almost in all cases having less than a high school education. If you look at all immigrants combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country. Here's another fact to chew on. The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet. There is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater. That fuels a lot of this fiscal cost, too. So since 1996, Congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem. Most states have ignored that law. New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens. New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens. Think about that if you are a -- -- well, I don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates. Now, the -- nationwide, as Tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits than they're paying in taxes. And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states. Indeed, I like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so, and then the states have to pay the burden. You can think of story after story about this. Hazelton, Pennsylvania, one of the cities that I'm representing, they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat. Population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income. And the city wasn't getting any revenues. Look what happened. All the costs to the city went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population. The school districts, the budget was breaking, English as a Second Language, the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year. In 2006, they went up to 1.1 million. Talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district. The same thing is happening at the national level. And as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost. Or take it on the individual level.  There are 14 million Americans out of work. A vast majority of the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the workforce. Many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for a U.S. citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today. It actually works. But of course many of you are probably thinking, and I'm sure we'll hear from the other side, that those are jobs Americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for Americans to do. Well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry -- industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, U.S. citizens still have the majority of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, U.S. citizens, 76 percent of food preparation workers, U.S. citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, U.S. citizens.  citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright. So if we care about our fiscal health, and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States."
against,"You too can go into politics. Thank you so much, and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event. So, like all of us, I’m a descendant of immigrants. In my case, there were two kinds of immigrants. On one side were the Eastern European Jews, and on the other side were the people who came on The Mayflower. So, I grew up in a house where I had two lessons. One was that difference was really kind of what made us great. It’s certainly what made the two sides of my family great. And I learned to understand later it was what made the country great. But I also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common -- this was another lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than our differences. And so I see the challenge for the country going forward, as it was in my family, is to make sure that balance is in the right -- is in balance, that we’re getting the benefits of the difference, but we’re also holding together as one country. And that’s where I start when I’m considering immigration. It’s not -- there have been words thrown around here: nostalgia, generosity, I’m not sure anybody mentioned rights, but that’s another way that a lot of people come at it. I don’t come at immigration from any of those perspectives. I come at it from what is in America’s interest. What’s really good for us, for our economy, for our security, and for our future? And that’s why I’m dead set against this motion. I don’t think it’s good for our economy or for our values. So let’s start by being honest. Immigration is about economics. It’s driven by economics, for the people who get up in their home villages and come here, and it’s driven by economics for the Americans who hire them. And the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win-win. Immigrants create jobs. And contrary to what you’ve just heard from Kris Kobach, it’s counterintuitive, I know, but you heard me right. Immigrants create jobs. It’s easy to see how that works on the high end. The 25 percent of the patents in the United States that are taken out by people who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the doctors in America who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the nurses, the half of all of our science and engineering Ph.D.s who are foreign-born. And you heard it from my partner, Julián, the quarter of the tech startups that were started by foreign-born. As in the past, countries competed -- powerful countries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies. Today, countries around the world are competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants. But it’s true at the low end, too, that immigrants create jobs. And again, I know this gets even more counterintuitive, but, you know, I’ll never forget here -- and this is really what partly brought me to do exactly what I’m doing now -- -- hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the Eastern Shore of Maryland talk about his company. He came to the floor of the Senate and he did this. He talked about how he had a 100-year-old family company. The native born people on the Eastern Shore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work. Americans like full -- year-round jobs. No one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell. So he brought Mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell -- very low-paid, uneducated people, seasonal workers. You know, that’s the low end of the economic totem pole. But because he had those seasonal workers, he could actually keep his company open in a way that he wouldn’t have been able to if he didn’t have them. And because he kept his company open, there was a job for the manager in the company and the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company. And because he could keep his company open, there was seafood for the restaurants in the town where the tourists came to eat seafood. And because those restaurants and the seafood, hotels, gas stations, insurers, you can get the picture -- up and down the food chain, those lowly, lowest bottom-of-the-totem seafood pickers were keeping an economy going. And the point is that on both the top and the bottom end of our economy, the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skill ladder, we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce. The American workforce is changing. We’re getting older. People are -- we’re having smaller families. People are retiring sooner. We’ve created -- we have holes at the top and bottom of the workforce, and we’re lucky that they’re filled by immigrants who, because they’re different from Americans, either more or less skilled, they’re complementary, not competitive. They create jobs for Americans. Of course, there are costs, and we’ll talk more about the costs in this -- I don’t deny there are costs to immigration, but in the long run, ultimately, the good far outweighs the bad. Our need for workers also changes. That’s not so -- in a bad economy, we need fewer foreign workers and in a good economy, we need more. But ultimately, the point is the patents, those PhDs, the startups and the jobs for U.S. workers up and down the food chain. And the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handle what I think is a given of the interconnected world. We're lucky immigrants are coming to fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy. And how are we going to handle it in a way that's consistent with our values, that maximizes the benefits, minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values? And this is really where I differ from my opponents in this debate. I too am for the rule of law. I too am for security and effective enforcement. But I also think we need to be honest about our needs. It doesn't really work I don't think to have two signs at the border, one that says, ""Help wanted,"" -- one that says, ""Keep Out"" and one that says ""Help Wanted."" I don't think that's an honest standup way to go about our business. I don't think we want to treat the people who come to work for us -- I think we want to treat them in an honest, standup way. We don't want to say, ""Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, come on in"" when times are good and then harass them with policing laws when times are bad to so that they leave. Ultimately, that's what I think today's debate is about. It's about how to do we deal with the reality of our economic needs in a way that's consistent with our values? And if you listen tonight, what I think you should be asking yourself is whose way is more likely to lead to a successful immigration and successful integration or assimilation? Is the best way accepting reality, allowing people to be here legally, treating them with dignity, or is the best way pretending that we don't need these workers, pretending that we can drive them out when we can't and driving them further underground?   And that concludes round one, opening statements of this “Intelligence Squared” debate. So here's where we are. We are past opening statements, and we're about to go into round two, and that's where the debaters address each other one on one. They take questions from me. And after a little bit, we'll take questions from you as well. And I want to, again, urge you, when you're formulating your question, to really think in terms of something that's terse and on the point and that really is a question. So if it has a question mark at the end of it that's there appropriately, that's the telltale sign that it's functioning as a question. What I'm trying to discourage is your debating with the debaters, but to throw something in here that would actually make them continue to hash out the issues. So I've got to do this part for radio. And I'll do this from time to time. I just need to do a little make believe welcome backs kind of thing, and we're taking a break, even though we really won't. So it would be a great help to me if you could do a round of applause that -- that will play coming back from a break in the radio broadcast, and then I'll start talking. Thanks very much for doing this. Go ahead. So we are back, and now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We're at an “Intelligence Squared U.S.” debate at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. Our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” We have two teams of two members each who have been arguing it out. The team arguing for the motion says that we're working under an out-of-control immigration system where the wrong people are getting in the wrong way and exploiting America's generosity, while also, in some cases, diluting America's American-ness. The other side is arguing that immigration may need some fixing but that it is vital for the U.S. economy. And they're also arguing that immigration actually is the American story. So I'd like to go to the side that is arguing for the motion, arguing don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses. And Tom Tancredo, you were talking about the notion that right now we're importing poverty. And I want to ask you, who is welcome? Who are the immigrants that are welcome?"
for,"Well, certainly, you could establish an immigration policy based upon the needs of the country in an economic sense. And that is a determination I think that we have mademany times during our past. Are our needs primarily low-skill, low-wage workers, or are they with high skilled. The people that Tamar and the mayor referred to as being these startup companies, these affluent -- or at least people who became affluent, had all these skills, great, fine. It's wonderful. But I'm telling you that that's not what our immigration policy is today. Today it is based almost entirely on something called family unification. And because we've had so many people coming into the country over such a long period of time from such low-skilled, low-wage backgrounds that that's who we get. Well, sure. It's, if you get here, once you get here and get status here, status as someone here legally, you can begin the process of bringing in your family, bringing in the immediate family then bringing in extended family. Being it's coming exactly from the same group of people, the same economic group, especially, that is predominantly low-skilled, low-wage workers when we have, right now, at least -- by the way, this is also legal -- I'm talking legal immigration. Let alone the people that are coming across the borders illegally. Not many of those people have these kinds of skills that you're talking about that are so desperately needed. It's interesting that you mention that because, of course, when we also start talking about the taxes that immigrants and even people who are here illegally pay, there is -- your side suggests that they're paying their fair share. But in reality, they pay nothing in terms of income taxes. Most of the people we're talking about end up getting income tax credit and therefore money back from the federal government because again, it's low-skilled, low-wage work. And low-skilled, low-wage people don't pay income taxes. They usually pay -- they pay sales taxes and that sort of thing. But it never balances off with -- -- the costs we incur for the infrastructure we provide. They do. That is true. And economic impacts are not positive. Which, by the way, they'll never be able to claim. But the fiscal impact is undisputed. Now, there are some economic studies that look at the overall impact. Have we cheapened the price of some goods? Have we given some economic benefits? But if you narrow it to the fiscal impact, it is undisputed. Every single study in the last 10 years, whether you're talking about Robert Rector's study in 2007 or the Census Bureau numbers that I related just a moment ago where you have seven, eight percent of illegal aliens consuming welfare programs, 51 percent of legal aliens and 39 percent of U.S. citizens, which, by the way, matches up well with that 40 percent figure. It shows statistically that they are consuming the fiscal benefits. And if you just look at in terms of the benefit to us as taxpayers, we're losing on --"
against,"I mean, again, it all just depends on how you measure it and how you look at it. If you look at it most immigrants pay their taxes to the federal level because they have their income tax withheld from their paycheck. So if you look not just at the state level, but the federal level as well, and you look over their whole lifetimes, they actually pay in about as much as they take out because what costs is health and education -- Let me finish. Let me finish. The cost is health and education. But then they turn into earners and taxpayers. And so if you look over their whole lives, if you look at the federal story as well, it's about an even-even. Social Security, they pay in every year about $7 billion that they don't take out because they pay in on -- illegal immigrants pay in on Social Security numbers, and they don't recoup the costs. So they get to keep the --John Donvan: But your opponents have made the case that in other ways that immigrants and illegal immigrants especially are drawing on the welfare system. Well, they're exaggerating their welfare numbers. But let me just make my -- Let me just make a closing point. The point is that what you're leaving out is growth, is the growth they make possible. And let me just give you a couple numbers. So in the State of North Carolina, they measured over the '90s, what an immigrants -- what was the fiscal cost and what was the growth made possible in consumption and adding to businesses. Fiscal costs over 10 years, $61 million. Now, that's real money, that's those costs by Latinos coming to the States -- growth, growth, 11 billion -- Growth, 11 billion."
for,"That rightwing organization, the National Academy of Sciences, I mean, will you accept that as a legitimate entity that assesses these issues? I mean, it doesn't have -- to the best of my knowledge, it doesn't have a dog in this fight, it doesn't have a political bone to pick with anybody. It's the National Academy of Sciences. You can argue with the -- with CIS and other studies, but the National Academy of Sciences shows that you're not correct, Tamar, when you suggest that this isn't a fiscal drain on this country. It most certainly is.Tamar Jacoby: That's not what that study found. It is also just common sense, it's not even something that you have to go through reams of statistical evidence to prove it is common sense. If you come here without an ability to provide a service that is well paid for you are not going to be able to pay the income taxes you're talking about, but you are undeniably going to require the services, the services for your children, the children who are in the public school system, the services for the -- the social services --"
against,And I consider educating the workforce of the future --
for,-- the social service benefits.
against,I consider educating the workforce for the future not as a welfare benefit but an investment.
for,"Yeah, or in the day today . Sure, an investment. Well, okay, how about the investment in our prison system? I with that study, that Texas Comptroller study looked -- it didn't just look at fiscal income and outgo, then they went on and considered, ""Well, have there been generations in second and third degree effects of extra businesses or extra -- -- consumption that might have occurred?"" Now, that's fine, and look, let's get this straight, the fiscal debate is clear, they are a fiscal drag. Now, I will agree that there are -- we get cheaper vegetables because of this, but you have to realize there are winners and there are losers. The winners are the employers who are able to exploit the illegal labor, the losers are the consumer -- the winners are the consumers of some goods who really want that extra two pennies off the price of a head of lettuce, but the losers are the U.S. citizens who lose their jobs, the U.S. citizens who are still working in those fields and are getting paid a lower wage, and the taxpayers. There's no doubt the taxpayers are the losers."
against,"None of this is true, that no economists -- -- no economists looking for a wage effect, there’s been people studying it for 20 years, even the most --"
for,George Borjas --
against,-- has found that over 20 years there's a less than five percent wage effect for the people at the very -- for a high school dropout.Kris Kobach: So you can see there is a wage effect. And other -- economists challenge him and say --
for,I agree.
against,"-- it’s less than one percent, and other economists who studied it say that so the division is between over 20 years for the -- only the 10 percent of Americans who drop out of high school, that for them it’s between one and four, and for everyone else it’s actually gains is wages --"
for,Can I see if we agree on this point?
against,-- for everyone else it’s gains in wages because having low skilled people there makes the productivity of the higher workers go up.
for,"So do we agree on -- do we agree on the Borjas numbers? Says that if you have a 10 percent increase in the number of laborers in a given industrial sector you will have in the short term a decrease in wages of seven to eight percent, and in the long term a decrease in wages of three to four percent, in the long term. So we agree on that, they can decide whether that's significant or not."
against,"Three to four, three to four."
for,I think that’s significant.
against,"For other high school dropouts. no, no --"
for,Because the numbers today are so high of people coming from a particular area into a geographic area that bring the culture -- That makes is much more difficult to assimilate.
against,"People in the second generation, even among poor -- children of poor Mexicans, everyone learns English. And the third generation, three-quarters of the people can’tspeak Spanish anymore, can’t speak to their grandmother. People are learning English as they did in the past. Where I want to shift the conversation is, I believe that the policies of our opposing team would actually make integration or assimilation harder, not easier. They want to keep people on the wrong side of the law, not let them make restitution and get right with the law and come into society. They want to end birthright citizenship so that the children of immigrants grow up not as citizens, which every study that’s looked at it has shown makes the parents less likely to learn the language and integrate."
for,"Well, actually, it’s to encourage people to leave and comply with the law and go home. That’s the idea. Now, but let me -- let me give one more point on assimilation, and that is one of the greatest engines of assimilation -- I think we can all agree on this -- is the public schools. In the past for the last 100 years or so, the public schools have been the primary engine of assimilation. That engine is not working anymore. According to a study done at a highschool in San Diego, I think in 2002 or 2003, after three years of high school, the proportion of students self-identifying themselves as Americans went down 50 percent. The proportion saying they were hyphenated Americans, in other words, Mexican-American or something like that, went down 30 percent. And the number that they were saying they are a foreign nationality after three years of high school went up 52 percent."
against,"And that study was done in the middle of the battle over Prop 187, which was denying benefits to immigrants --"
for,That was in 1994.
against,"-- had commercials on TV saying stop them coming -- I know the study you’re talking about, Rumbaugh’s study, and what he was showing was that when there’s an anti-immigrant climate, people get alienated and identify with their group. And that’s exactly what I would argue your side is creating, is an anti-immigrant climate that drives people to identify with their group and not assimilate."
for,"Sure, the logical argument is this: If people come into this country illegally, especially illegally, we should all go, huh, well, you're an immigrant, and therefore we should be happy about the fact you're here. We should not -- we should not raise our concerns about it. We should not say that people should come into the country the legal way. There is a door. 180 -- 165,000 people a month come in today still legally. We are the most liberal country in the world regarding to legal immigration. But the minute we start talking about the fact that people are violating American laws to get here, that's all of a sudden making it an uncomfortable place for immigrants. Well, bologna. I will not accept the idea that you can't talk the rule of law and be critical of people coming into this country illegally."
against,I agree with you that illegal immigration -- I agree with you -- Tom Tancredo:What's wrong with that? -- that illegal immigration is not what the country wants. And I agree with you --
for,But you want to grant an amnesty.
against,"that we need enforcement of the rule of law. But the problem is our system makes it hard to enter legally, and we don't have enough places for the workers we need. And then we make it easy to enter illegally."
for,"A million -- a little over a million and a quarter people coming legally every year. And by the way, as you know, Tamar, the number of visas that are allowable for people to come here and work in the agricultural arena, H-2A, I believe, are unlimited. Right there you could have 10 million people come tomorrow and on their visas. You don't because -- Just a moment. You don't have that because -- All right.  Here legally. Here legally and are U.S. citizens -- -- primarily. But let me correct a number Julián mentioned. The census bureau, the actual number, you’re right, 308 million total people residing in America, approximately 36 million are aliens, and that includes legal and illegal. So it's about 12 percent -- -- of the population. And that is basically -- 11. -- -- million is illegal. You do the math."
against,"That is a good question. Are you guys against just illegal immigration, or are you against immigration, period?"
for,"I'm telling you what we are in favor of is increasing the percentage of aliens who are exactly the ones you're talking about, the job creators, the entrepreneurs that are starting the companies. The way you increase that percentage is you reduce illegal immigration to zero, and you change our priorities about legal immigration, and you give higher preference to people who are skilled."
against,And who --
for,"We can accept the cream of the crop, and we should."
against,And who's going to grow our food? And who's going to take care of our old people? And who's going to work in hospitals?
for,"Well, the 14 million unemployed Americans would be a starter. Mayor of Detroit has already responded to that, I think. Yeah, Mayor Bloomberg, you notice he didn't suggest that the illegal aliens come to any particular borough of New York. And the citizens of Detroit weren't asked whether -- you know, they're facing unemployment -- whether they would like a large number of unskilled folks to come in and help revive their economy by taking a job they're already --"
against,"You can make light of this, but I mean, it's true. Go to any immigrant neighborhood, they revitalize the neighborhoods. They open shops. They open restaurants. They've taken burnt out neighborhoods across the country and revitalized them on the same way they create small businesses, and they're -- and they're consumers. Yes, I don't know if we really want to send them all to Detroit. But the truth is immigrants bring economic vitality, and they create jobs. He's on to something.Julián Castro: First, as I said earlier, the studies have shown that immigrants as a class have a higher rate of founding businesses than native born U.S. votes. Mayor Bloomberg is correct, and that's why he has made the economic argument very powerfully for both more legal immigration and then doing something with the 11 million folks who are here illegally. It is not realistic that you're going to deport 11 million people because it would decimate the American economy and because -- and this isn't about dollars and cents, but because these people are human beings. They're human beings."
for," What our opponents have done here is very skillful, really great at it, and I give them credit for setting up all kinds of straw man arguments, you know, that if you are opposed to immigration, you don't understand that some people who are coming here are patriots and want to be -- well, of course, it's absolutely true. Nobody's suggesting that every single immigrant comes here under that premise. But the idea that you -- when you say you can't deport, I don't have any -- I have never once, in as many millions of words as I have expended on this topic, suggested everybody's got to be deported. All I've ever said is, look, all you have to do is obey the law. All you have to do is restrict the ability of a employer to give a job to somebody who is here illegally. People self-deport when that happens. It happened in Arizona. You do not have to round people up. These are all cannards. These are all things that people on the other say to make it look as though we're all people who are just waiting and biding our time until we can get these people out of our country. "
against,Your policy is even worse than deportation.
for,"Why is it hard to suggest that obeying the law would be a good way to deal with -- -- the immigration problem? How do you -- what's the deal?Tamar Jacoby: The theory behind this policy -- the theory behind the policy that Tom Tancredo and Kris Kobach are advocates for is called attrition through enforcement. It's, let's make immigrants' lives so miserable that they go home of their own accord. First of all, it doesn't work. Many immigrants who are here, the unauthorized immigrants, are people who have been here for five years, 10 years, 20 years, who own homes, who own businesses, who are married to legal Americans. They have citizen children. You might get a few to go home. But most are not going to go home. And honestly, I don't think that's how we want to deal with this population. These are people who we said, ""nudge, nudge, wink, wink, come on in. Do some work for us.”"
against,"And now we're saying, let's make their lives so miserable that --"
for,"Statistically -- statistically, attrition through enforcement works. And it's basically the idea. It's the same law enforcement approach you have. You have a section of highway 95 where there are no police officers patrolling. You don't say, well, the only options are to have an amnesty, i.e., have no speed limit, or to catch 100 percent of the speeders.  Which would mean to -- Okay.  We have the numbers. Arizona, more than any other state, has tried to encourage people to leave. Give disincentives. Take away public benefits. From middle of 2008 tomiddle of 2009, the overall illegal alien population in the United States dropped seven percent. In Arizona, in dropped 18 percent, more than double the national average."
against,But most of them didn't go home.
for,The only difference was the enforcement.
against,But most of them didn't go home. They went to other neighboring states right next to --
for,Then why did the Mexican -- why did the Mexicans – why did the Mexican state of

for,Why did president --
against,"-- many of these people anymore. Mexico, they’ve been out of Mexico for 10 or 15 or more years, they're married to Americans, they have citizen children, Mexico's not home anymore. They leave and go to Oklahoma.John Donvan: Okay. I'm getting in my ear to go to some more questions and there's a woman in the fourth row, and thank you."
for,"I'd like to answer one her points, though. The designation, by the way, is by the Southern Poverty Law Center which designates lots of people lots of things, but the bit about no human being being illegal, the reason I use the term ""illegal alien"" or ""alien unlawfully present in the United States,"" is those are the terms used by federal law, and being a lawyer, I try to use the terms used by law. The word ""undocumented immigrant"" does not appear anywhere in the entire United States Code. the term ""undocumented worker"" does not appear. I understand that perfectly well. I understand it perfectly well and -- I'd love to take it, because, yeah. Because these questions really are a lot of fun -- I’ve got -- but -- -- now, let me just -- Let me try to make this interesting because that's what a constitutional law professor does. Really, no, the question -- the doctrine you're talking about is preemption doctrine. That is the idea that some things that Congress can only do and some things that they -- and the states can do alongside Congress. The United States Supreme Court last opined on this in 1976 about a California immigration law and said, yes, the states can do things to discourage illegal immigration. There is a case before the United States Supreme Court right now, Whiting versus Chamber of Commerce, we should have a decision within the next month or so, this will be the first time the Supreme Court has spoken in 35 years. So the precedents are very clearly there, and that's why many of these cases, the states and cities are winning. It's really interesting, the census has what’s called a current population survey and they do these every month and they do a really big one in March. And they actually give them to everybody and illegal aliens answer these surveys. And so they’re based on very large surveys done by the Census Bureau. And those numbers, the 11.3 million, those are generally agreed upon numbers by both the Pew Center and by the Center for Immigration Studies so I think there’s broad agreement --"
against,"Something technical, we agree on something technical."
for,"I think I at least attempted to address that when I spoke earlier when I talked about these periods of timeout. In fact, we have had immigrants -- immigration is an important part of America. There is nothing -- there is no argument about that. It’s just that it was rational over American history to create an immigration policy that fit the time, that fit the economic situation in the country. That’s exactly what happened in the 1890s and the 1900s, massive immigration, low-skilled people. Fine, worked, it’s okay. And so you can say over a long period of time, it worked. Well, it would work again today except that we have never had this timeout. And we continue to bring in the same category, low-skilled, low-wage worker, even though we don’t have enough jobs. I mean, it makes no sense."
against,"The problem with your arguments -- with our opponents’ arguments about integration and assimilation is they’re all based on hypotheticals. There’s no timeout. There was a timeout in the past. There’s too much welfare, that we didn’t have so much welfare in the past. But you’re not looking at the empirical evidence of whether today’s immigrants are integrating, and they are. 99.9 percent of the children are learning English. Even in the first generation, the home ownership rates and the wealth accumulation rise to Americans of similar background. They’re owning homes. They’re starting businesses. They fighting our wars, and they’re integrating."
for,"Almost every single study on this -- this is one of the -- another area where there is some degree of agreement in the number of studies out there. Hispanic immigrants in America -- although Hispanics make economic and educational gains from the first to the second generation, not disputed, the progress stops there. Third-generation Hispanics still earn significantly less than whites, graduate from collegeat less than 50 percent of whites, and, by the way, in terms of language, still do not accept English as the primary language, even at the third generation."
against,That’s just not true.
for,"Well, that’s -- okay. So we have another argument about statistics."
against,"Well, but there is actually something to say about this. Can I just -- can I say something to that? It’s not about -- I’m not going to talk about -- I’m going to talk about immigration, I promise you, I promise you. John Donvan:Save it for your closing remarks. And for many industries, the choice is actually do we send the jobs abroad or do we have the immigrants come here? For, in agriculture, if immigrants don’t come here, I guarantee you, Americans are not going to go out into the fields and pick lettuce and pick fruit. We will start outsourcing --"
for,The majority of employees in those fields are Americans right now.
against,We will start outsourcing agriculture.
for,"According to the census, the majority -- 56 percent are Americans in those fields right now. Well, see, you heard the numbers, although they're somewhat disputed about the fiscal drag. I think everybody's coming to an agreement, Democratic or Republican alike that we have to get a hold of this deficit, $1.4 trillion a year. Well, if we don't create -- if we do not create, in this country, 200,000 jobs a month, that's 200,000 new jobs every month have to be created in this country by the private sector in order for us to climb out of this recession, okay? Most economists agree that that's the number. We haven't had a 200,000 monthly increase in quite some time. But we do bring in 160 some thousand a month legally, let alone the numbers that come across the border and fly in this country and stay, which is a significant number. It's not just people coming across the border who are illegal aliens in the country. And so they're part of the problem. Where do those jobs go?"
against,"So the key and the most important change -- -- is that we give the workers who we're going to need in the future a way to come legally. Right now, we don't need that many foreign workers. We need some in agriculture. And at the high end, we don't need that many. But in the future when the economy picks up, and Americans go back to their better jobs and their year-round jobs, and they start to go to restaurants, and they start to go to hotels, and we start to build houses again, we're going to need immigrant workers. And on that day, I say we want to have them come legally as opposed to illegally. If our economy needs them, have them come legally. I also think we need enforcement. Our opponents aren't wrong about enforcement. We do need better enforcement on the border and better enforcement in the workplace to make sure -- we need to create legal channels and enforce against the people who are coming illegally. And we need some answer for the 11 million people who are already here and are not going home no matter how miserable we make them with police stops and other things. You know, maybe some of them will go home -- No, no. You need -- the best answer for illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. If people are coming to work here, give them a legal way to come and then stop the illegals coming --"
for,"Amnesty is a horrible idea for four quick -- for four reasons. Number one, you're going to see that the fiscal impact is going to triple. The 89.3 -- $89.1 billion a year that we're losing fiscally is going to become 2.6 trillion over 10 years. That was according to the Robert Rector study in 2007. The reason is simple. Right now, illegal aliens get food stamps, Medicaid, free school lunches, K through 12 education. If they become legalized, then they get the big ones. Then they get Medicare and Social Security. Andthe price goes way, way up.  Number two, it won't just be 11.3 million. The last time we had a major amnesty in 1986, according to the INS's own records, 398,000 illegal aliens quickly came across the border to falsely claim that they were already here and grabbed the amnesty. Number three, we've been hearing about the terrorists. We mentioned that earlier about the terrorists coming in. The notion that we are going to suddenly sift through this population and know who the terrorists are and who they aren't is demonstrably false. Mahmud Abouhalima who was one of the ring leaders in the ’93 attack on the World Trade Center here in this city was given amnesty in the 1986 amnesty. And number four, it's a slap in the face to the people -- -- who did it the right way."
against,No one's talking about amnesty. We're talking about asking people to make restitution and get right with the law. Nobody's talking about amnesty.
for,"A slap on the wrist, and then you get to stay. That's called amnesty. As a lawyer who has worked in this area, you're right. It's about 30,000 who are detained. Those are people in deportation proceedings. We call them removal proceedings. But that's a small percentage of the total number of people who are being removed from the country at any given time. And the reason that 30,000 is actually too low is that if you do not detain an alien while he is in removal proceedings, and then the judge says, at the end of the immigration removal hearing, ""You are deported,"" hands him a removal letter, 93 percent will abscond. They will leave. They will disobey the letter. And it's known among the immigration attorneys as a run letter. And so if you don't detain, they don't go. And if we believe that our courts have any meaning, and are nothing more than just a laughing stock, we have got to try to detain the ones that present the highest risk of leaving --"
against,"But the point is the whole system is broken. So the point is that the market -- -- works really well to attract people -- when times are good, the market attracts people. And when times are bad, people get the signal all the way to their villages in Mexico, and they don't come. Since the downturn, half as many people have been coming every year from Mexico, half. People hear that there are no jobs, and so they don't come. They're not coming for welfare. They're not coming for unemployment. They don't get those things. They're coming to work. And that's -- we should be happy about that.  We should be happy that the market sends the signals. And the system that --John Donvan: Tom Tancredo. -- I think we should have is a way for when the market is good and attracting people, those people who are coming to work should be able to come legally. I don't think we need people working here and being --"
for,"Tamar apparently agrees that jobs are the attraction. Without the jobs, they don't come. Without the jobs, they go back. Therefore, it's an enforcement issue. Something that's called -- right now, it's a program that's voluntary. It should be mandatory. It's called E-Verify, just a requirement that every employer use a process that --"
against,I'm for E-Verify.
for,"-- actually verifies whether the person is -- has got a good social security number. Now, can it be -- can there be problems? Of course. You can steal the social security. But it's a great use of a tool that's out there that would not cost a great deal of money, it's an easy process, and it would have the effect if Tamara's right that people won't come if they hear there's no jobs, it would have the effect I think also of saying I believe if there are no jobs -- -- so many people left, by the way -- -- so many people left in Arizona -- Julián Castro:Let me just say that I agree that jobs are what drive folks over here. I disagree with the idea that if those jobs aren't there at a given time that they're necessarily just going to go back. You know, the point was made very early that these folks -- let's say that you've had a job for 12 years, 13 years, and you've had -- and you're married now and you have children who are United States citizens, you know, for the children the United States is home. Mexico or wherever they're from is not home. And in many ways, Mexico isn't even the place that feels like home anymore. So it's a much more complicated issue than just to say if you press this button then this is going to happen. That's not reality. That's not ."
against,"So I work with seasonal employers. I just did a survey of a couple hundred of -- actually probably up to 500 seasonal employers. These are like resorts in remote places and fruit picking and seasonal work. And I asked them, are more Americans showing up now in the downturn to apply for these jobs? And what they tell me is in the past, no, Americans showed up to work in a seasonal job but, yes, this year a little uptick in the numbers of Americans showing up, but then when they learn that it's only a seasonal job and that it's physically -- that it's outside and that it's not going to lead to anything, that they're going to have to leave at the end, people are not taking those jobs, staying for maybe a few weeks and then leaving. The Americans are not competing with immigrants. They're mostly doing jobs that Americans do not -- are not wanting to do. But you're leaving out the turnover also went up."
for,That’s exactly what has to happen.
against,The turnover went through the roof because people do the jobs for a little while and then they don’t want to do them anymore.
for,"Twenty years ago, the average wage in meatpacking was about $12 an hour."
against,And that's --
for,"Now it’s about eight dollars an hour, that’s not in real dollars that’s in absolute dollars. There’s no other industry --"
against,"John Donvan: I have to separate the you because that concludes round two of our debate. Oh, no."
for,"I mentioned that I first got into this whole thing because of the intellectual stimulation I believe that it provides. And I think tonight’s a good example, that it certainly does that. It is a fascinating discussion, and I sincerely respect the opinions of the people on the other side of this. I would say that there is, for America, I think all of us at this table want exactly what has been expressed, Julián, by you, certainly an opportunity for people who come here, an opportunity to do great things. I also want for people who live here, for people who are on the lowest rung of the economic ladder in this country to also have an opportunity, to have the ability to actually get a job, progress through the system, and especially the ones -- I’m talking about the ones that have done it the right way. Nothing hurts -- there’s no group of people in the United States that’s more negatively impacted by massive immigration, both legal and illegal, of low-skilled, low-wage people, than the people who are here legally, who are low-skilled, low-wage people. They are our citizens. Why is it so hard for us to think about them, to think about their needs? For the most part, you know, when we’re talking about the immigration process and these people, they came the right way. And, by the way, this has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, absolutely nothing. I assure you that if Italy was on our southern border, had as much poverty, as much population, we would have just as many problems with Italians coming across that border illegally. It’s got nothing to do with ethnicity, nothing. Although it’s always tried to be -- people try to cast it in that light because they want to move the discussion away from the real problem and to this bogeyman of racism. Is it out there? Of course. But I’ll tell you what, it does not motivate me. All I want is for this country to achieve its goals. I want it to be the place, yeah, that, still, everybody wants to come because we have a vibrant economy in which most of the people here are doing well, in fact, all of the people are doing well, and this is -- John Donvan:Tom Tancredo, your time’s up.  "
against,"Well, in conclusion, I would just like to sharpen the choice here a little bit. I think what you’ve heard is we all agree that the immigration system we have isn’t working, but we differ in a very sharp way about what the solution is. Our opponents say that the solution has one dimension. It’s enforcement and enforcement only. We say that the solution has several dimensions. Yes, it’s enforcement. Yes, it’s security. But it’s also a legal immigration system that works. The best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. And I urge -- and the other place we disagree is we disagree over whether immigration and, really, the economy in America and American life is a zero-sum game or not. Our opponents are saying they have the vision of America that leaves no room for people with energy and grit and entrepreneurialism who want to come here and make better lives for their families, but also make America a better place. They have no room for -- their vision leaves no room for hope and for an expansive America. Their vision is that there’s never enough of anything and that’s it’s a zero-sum game. And our point is that that’s just not true in America. Yes, we’re in a hard time now, but that hard time is not going to last forever. Immigrants don't take jobs. They create them. Immigrants don't threaten us. They bring talent and vitality. American culture and society haven't lost their appeal. Immigrants are as drawn to them as ever, and immigrants are still integrating or assimilating every bit as fast as they did in the past. So I think the notion is exactly wrong. Shutting the gates now would be a disastrous policy. We need immigrants to create jobs and grow. And that need's only going to get stronger as the economy recovers. Just saying no isn't an answer. It's a fantasy, and it's an un-American fantasy at that.  Our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” And here to argue for the motion, Kris Kobach, Secretary of State of Kansas and co-author of Arizona's S.B. 1070, the legal immigration law."
for,"I just want to address a couple of loose ends quickly. Julián just mentioned this notion that if we had an amnesty, it would be just fine. It'd be fair because the illegal aliens would go to the end of the line. Legally speaking, that's impossible. When you have an amnesty, you immediately give lawful status to the people who are here. They have been automatically given what four to five million people are waiting for who are trying to do it the right way. There is no such thing as the end of the line. As soon as you grant an amnesty, the person is automatically at the front of the line. And then we heard from them earlier that we shouldn't have a policy that fluctuates, encourages immigration some years, it discourages it depending on the needs of the U.S. economy. It should be pretty much wide open all the time.  That's exactly what we want. We want immigration policy that is legal and that meets the interests of the United States because we owe our highest duty to our own citizens. And finally, we hear about this point again and again, and they're encouraging this myth of belief that there are jobs Americans won't do. And we have to bring them in for the lower end jobs because Americans won't do those jobs. Now, remember, I told you the statistics. Americans are doing those jobs. But there's a cultural problem with that argument too. It's encouraging high school kids today, many of whom have never pulled on the starter cord of a Briggs and Stratton lawnmower engine, to believe that certain jobs are beneath them. I would say that is un-American. Our country is built on manual labor, everybody going through a period in their life when they worked a job like that, and then they moved on. Well, this attitude of, let the immigrants do those jobs is a pernicious attitude in our society. And so I'll conclude -- -- conclude with this. Don't give us your tired and your poor because our tired and our poor American citizens, who are disproportionately minority and who are out of work need those jobs. They need also the welfare state to survive. And those things are not going to happen if you have a massive amnesty or you have unbridled illegal immigration continuing, which an amnesty would further. So let's look after our own tired and our own poor and then look at immigration in terms of what services our national interests.John Donvan: Thank you, Kris Kobach. And that concludes our closing statements. And now it's time to learn which side you feel argued best. We're asking you to go again to the key pads to the right of your seat and to register your vote. We will get the readout almost immediately. So our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” And if you agree with this motion, if you agree with don't give us, push number one. If you disagree, push number two. And if you are -- remain undecided or became undecided, push number three. And it'll lock in. So we're done with the excitement of the evening. And I just want to say that in an issue that was as contentious as this, I so respected how these two teams actually respected the argument and respected each other's arguments enough to hear them, and I want to congratulate them all."
