But for the worst, of the worst, of the worst -- not at all. My partner is the incredibly erudite and always sober Kent Scheidegger. Well, my basic belief is that in a civilized society, the most important function of government is to protect people from violent assault . And that is true -- whether the source of the threat be foreign or domestic.",nan
for,"Reasonable people can disagree about whether capital punishment is a morally appropriate sanction for the most heinous of c rimes. And our opponents place tremendous value on retribution by execution. They think that is an incredible benefit. But I think when you reason about this as a public policy issue, and that's why we're here, and you look at the costs and benefits of having a death penalty versus life without parole at a maximum security prison, you're going to reach the same conclusion that six states have reached in the last six years : the death penalty doesn't work . It should be repealed and abolished. What are the costs ? The death penalty creates an undeniable and unacceptable risk of executing innocents . The death penalty does not deter . The National Academy of Sciences recently reviewed all of the studies and found no evidence of a deterrent effe ct. And common sense tells you that, because the states that execute the most, like Texas and Virginia, do not have lower homicide rates, do not have lower crime rates , than the states that don't have the death penalty. The death penalty is ad ministered arbitrarily. It depends on the quality of your representation. And who has money and your race often turns on -- often determines what kind of representation you get. The death penalty also depends on where you're tried . It's incredibly arbitrary in this sense . It's only 2 percent of counties in the United States that are responsible for 60 -- 56 percent of the executions -- of the death sentences and 52 percent of executions . There are race effects that Diann is going to talk to you ab out at some length, particularly having to do with the race of the victim. And the death penalty, as Diann will also address at greater length, does nothing to increase or insure public safety . So , this undermines the fair administration of justice . Take California. We know that in California there are over 700 people on death row . And they haven't had an execution for years . And they have hundreds of people who have been convicted and sentenced to death that don't have lawyers in a po st-conviction setting, and they're closing down civil courts . And the dockets are clogged, and this led to a judge recently in California saying, ""It is the gridlock, it is the -- in California that makesthe death penalty unconstitutional, because it is freakish and it is arbitrarily applied."" You are more likely to die of natural causes after 24 years in prison in California than you are to be executed . Now, there should not be any disagreement about one moral and one factual question, and that is the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people . Bob talked about the Boston Marathon bomber trial, but let's not forget that in April -- early April Anthony Hinton walked off death row in Alabama. Bryan Stevenson -- he had been on deat h row for 30 years. He was convicted based on bogus ballistics evidence . And the prosecution held back exculpatory evidence in that case for nine years . And he had an ineffective lawyer as the Supreme Court itself ruled. Just this week a young man in New Orleans, Mr. Stewart -- Kia Stewart, was exonerated with the help of the prosecutors and the Innocence Project in New Orleans . He was tried for murder in New Orleans, represented by law students at Tulane Law School and a supervisor that had no experience in murder cases . This kind of stuff goes on all across the country, and we've got to face up to it. What is the error rate of convicting people that are innocent? Sam Gross at the University of Michigan Law School submitted a paper in the National Academy of Science Proceedings and showed that when you look at capital convictions, you can demonstrate on innocence grounds a 4.1 percent error rate, 4.1 percent error rate. I mean, would you accept that in flying airplanes ? I mean, really . Now, there's no doubt innocents have also been executed. I hope you're all familiar with the work of our colleague, Jim Liebman, from Columbia Law School, documenting the wrongful execution of Carlos DeLuna . And I certainly hope you're aw are of the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in Texas based on what now is acknowledged by the state itself to be bogus arson evidence for an arson murde r, killing his three children . And we now have evidence that there was a jailhouse sni tch that committed perjury by his own admission, and you can demonstrate it in the case . And now the Texas Bar has brought the prosecutor in that case up on charges , because he knew about a deal with the jailhouse snitch that he never revealed. Now, that is unbelievable . You cannot anymore kid yourself on the fact that innocents have been executed due to junk forensic science, prosecutorial misconduct, law enforcement misconduct, ineffective lawyers . This system is incapable not just of determining who's guilty or innocence in the final analysis when charging them with the ultimate punishment but reliably figuring out who should die and who shouldn't. We shouldn't be tinkering with the machinery of death,and we see prosecutors telling u s this every day. Mark Earley, the attorney general of Virginia, who presided and brought about 36 executions, has just come to the position as he left office that ""The death penalty is based on a false utopian premise . That false premise is that we have had and do have and will have 100 percent accuracy in death penalty convictions and executions . Who should live and who should die ? I can no longer support the imposition of a penalty so final in nature yet so fraught with failures."" Go look at the stat ement of Marty Stroud, a prosecutor in a Caddo Parish, Shreveport, Louisiana -- Glenn Ford, 30 years on death row, innocent . Marty prosecuted him . He recently gave this statement, he said it'll be his only one, where he said, ""How did this happen? I knew that the defense lawyers were -- had never tried a capital case, and I wanted to win . We all wanted to win. I was 32 years old, and I wanted to win, and I didn't see it."" So, I leave this to you : our friend, George Will. All right, Geo rge Will has said that ""Conservatives -- capital punishment is a government program, so skepticism is in order.""",nan
against," Why do we have the death penalty ? T here are three reasons . The first reason is that for some crimes , such as the marathon bombing, any lesser penalty is simply a travesty of justice . And Professor Blecker will talk about that in his turn. The second reason is incapacitation . An executed killer never kills again . We cannot say that for certain with a killer sentenced to life without parole . In the cases that I personally have worked on, there are half a dozen cases of murder of people who have been killed by killers who were sentenced t o life in prison already, bef ore they committed the murder . One contracted out the murder of the witnesses to his first murder . Another one killed multiple people within prison . Another one escaped from prison and killed people after he left . There -- life without parole is not a zero -risk option . If we choose life in prison for killers, we do risk killing innocent people . Then there is deterrence . It is a basic principle of human behavior thatincentives matter, that if you raise the cost of doing a nything, fewer people will choose to do that thing . Logically, then, you would think that an effective enforced death penalty would save innocent lives for deterrence . And we should demand a very convincing evidence by anyone who claims to th e contrary. There are empirical studies, but it's not a hard science . The one thing all experts agree on is that the case has not been proved either way, for or against deterrence . It certainly is not true that deterrence has been disproved, and the report Mr . Scheck referred to did not say that there is no evidence in favor of deterrence . There are a number of empirical studies showing a deterrent effect estimating between five and 18 innocent lives saved per execution. These studies have their critics to be sure . The authors have responded to the critics and shown that the results still hold, even considering the criticism. The bottom line is we should not get rid of a penalty that is independently justified by just -- by justice if doing so risks taking innocent lives through lost deterrents . The arguments against the death penalty are like a game of whack -a -mole . Every time we refute one of the arguments they just come up with another one . The old claim from the old days was that the death penalty was discriminatorily enforced against African American defendants . That claim was uniformly refuted by study after study, including the defendant's own. Then they came to a backup c laim that the death penalty was discriminatorily not imposed on murderer s who kill black victims. That -- the evidence there is more mixed . A lot of times somebody with an ax to grind will come out with a study claiming that and a reanalysis of the data taking into account all the relevant variables, w ill show that that effect just disappears into the statistical grass . Then they fall back to the claim of excessive cost versus life without parole . The problem there is that the studies claiming that are seriously flawed . They often fail to consider the very high costs of medical care for a person all the way to the end of his life if he's truly going to be held in prison to natural death. They typically include unnecessary costs as co sts of the death penalty. In California the study that was cited to claim the excessive cost of the death penalty counted as the number one cost of the death penalty the cost of keeping a person on death row for 26 years of appeals . Well, three fourths o f that cost is unnecessary . In a capital case where there is no doubt who did it, which is most capital cases, you can get it done in six years, which Virginia did with the D.C .  Risk of executing the innocent is much less than the other side say s and it's less today than it was say 15 years ago with all the greater scrutiny that we have on forensic science . In most capital cases, again, there's no doubtwhatever who did it . The claim you may have heard of 152 innocent people, that list has been debunked. People on that list have been proved conclusively guilty by DNA . The same DNA advances that they prove that case guilty were also used for post -mortem testing of people who had been already convicted and already executed. The othe r side thought they were going to hit the Holy Grail and they were going to find conclusive evidence through this post- mortem testing of an innocent person executed. In fact, none of them panned out and their poster boy was found conclusively guilty . Now we have the Willingham case . I don't have time for details, but bear in mind there are two sides to that story . There is material in that case . There is evidence in that case you did not read in New Yorker magazine and that will be coming out later I'm sure . There are a handful of cases, though, of people who were really innocent and who were really sentenced to death. But ask yourself where would those people be if they had been sentenced to life without parole instead? In most cases they would still be in prison and they would never get out, because an inmate who is sentenced to death gets a government paid lawyer for the second review of his case and the third review of his case and that is where this evidence often comes out. Someon e sentenced to life in prison, he may have longer time to prove innocence, but he doesn't have the resources, and so in most cases nobody's going to care about his case . The risk of an innocent person dying in prison and never getting out is greater if he's sentenced to life in prison than it is if he's sentenced to death. So the death penalty is an important part of our system . It's important for justice. Reforms are needed to make the process focus more on actual guilt and innocence and less on othe r issues. And in the process we can make it more sure, more swift, less costly, and more just . So , let's mend it, not end it, and I ask you to vote no on this motion.  So, let the punishment fit the crime . We've mouthed that for centuries . But do we believe it ? Do we practice it ?  Not at all. We mock it in the very administration of our criminal justice system, because the grand irony is, however counter- intuitive this is, that inside prison, it's nobody's job to punish.  I hear Diann Rust- Tierney talking about safety, I think I'm listening to the corrections officers, because that's whatI asked them, what their mission is, w hat are you trying to accomplish here? Their answer uniformly, speaking almost with one voice, ""Safety . I want to keep the public safe from these guys, I want to keep these guys safe from each other, and I want to keep the staff safe from the inmates."" Safety, safety, safety. And then I ask, ""But what about their crime ? What do they deserve?"" And their answer is, ""It's none of my business what a guy did out there . I'm only concerned with one thing : how does he behave once he's inside?"" So for lifers, life begins when the sentence of life begins . From the corrections point of view, it's all a clean slate, and it's nobody's job to punish . Look at the mission statements of the departments of corrections . They guide corrections. You will not find the word, ""punishment,"" in any mission statement in any part -- in any department of corrections in the United States, or its synonyms, not one . So, it's no surprise that given the fact that no part of their mission is to punish, that they run their prisons in such a way that life becomes relatively ple asant. Now, what am I talking about ? I mean, Barry Scheck talks about life without parole inside of a maximum security prison . For one thing, you may not be sentenced to life without parole and end up in a maximum security prison. You're going to start out there, but you may not end up there . In many states that I have visited, a perfectly well- behaved killer, the most vicious of killers, who prey on the vulnerable, are likely to be the most cowardly of killers, will be perfectly compliant once they're arrested . So, they will be pussycats, and they will be there for a long time . So, they will be reliable, and, therefore, they will be given the best lifestyles, the best hustles inside the prison. It's fundamentally perverse . Those who de serve it least will often suffer most . Those who deserve it most will have the best lives in prison and may well be transferred to a high medium security prison where they'll be playing softball and volleyball. And, by the way, you can do that in a maxim um security prison in Riverbend . I watched convicted killers playing softball in a softball field with chalk base pads and umpires in uniform, and not prison uniform, and softball uniforms, high -fiving it after they hit homeruns . The reality of life without parole, given the way that prison is administered, given the television sets, given the first -run movies in many cases, given recreation, given the hours and hours outside of the cell daily, the reality is it's nobody's job to punish and there is no punishment going on. The closest we come to serious punishment left in this society is the death penalty . So, when you consider the question, you can't consider it in isolation . You have to consider it in context, that we are a society that is increasingly disavowing punishment itself. Now, we advocates for the death penalty have tostruggle against different groups . One group, for example, are the indiscriminate ""Kill them all"" set, ""Person kills, kill them."" They don't want to hear about mercy. They don't want to -- they don't want to hear about mitigation, j ust “kill him."" They are indiscriminate . On the other side, there are the indiscriminates whose heart bleeds for every killer, ""Evil? No such thing,"" or, ""We're all evil"" .  ""Let those without any sin punish, we all have sin,"" so, therefore, nobody punishes . And a third group we have to set ourselves in opposition to are our supposed allies who say, ""No, we're against the death penalty . That's not n early enough . You really want to punish him ? Give him life without parole . Let him die every day in prison."" Well, the fact is they don't die every day in prison or at least no differently than we all die every day a little bit. When you e xamine what goes on, life takes on new meaning, new pleasures, new communities . So when you consider the motion, don't consider it in isolation. Consider the actual alternative in practice . And yet I would argue for the death penalty separately from tha t. Some people deserve to die, and we have the obligation to execute them . Now, who are they ? And can we determine them adequately in advance ? Yes, we can . We can do it through definition, and we can do it through enumeration. In terms of definition, it's a function of the attitude, the cruel, the callous, the wanton. And so I would reserve the death penalty for essentially terrorists, mass murderers, murderers of vulnerable victims, especially children, rapist murderers, contract killers, torture killers, and it -- so definite -- we cannot precisely and fully define it in advance, but we can get to the core . I offer a model death penalty statute based upon tho usands of hours and years talking to killers and listening to them. And we can also do it by enumeration. Joshua Komisarjevsky broke into the Petit house, took Michaela and Hayley, tied them to their beds in their upstairs bedroom for six hours . Took Mi chaela, repeatedly sexually abused her, took cell phone photos of her, and sent them to the friends . And then in order to eliminate the evidence, before he left took gasoline and doused her on and around her and her sister and burnt them to death, alive . He deserves to die. Fedell Caffey and Jacqueline Williams, they wanted another child. She already had three . So, what did they do ? They got Debra Evens . They cut the fetus out of her . And then to eliminate the witnesses, they killed her 10 -year -old daughter,abducted her eight -year -old son, and murdered him . They deserve to die. Danny Rolling, the ninja killer, terrorized the whole town of Starke, Florida, broke into houses, tortured, mutilated, murdered. He deserved to die. Lawrence Brewer took an innocent black guy walking down the street, and for sport this white supremacist dragged him to his death in an unspeakable torture . We can enumerate them in advance, not only who should we kill, how should we kill, not by lethal injection, a terrible method, and not because it might cause pain, but because it certainly causes confusion. It confuses punishment with medicine . It's all part of the deeper issue . And so ultimately we get to the question of, why ? Why should we punish? Not for the sake of deterrence, that would be using a person as a means to our own ends . That would be sending a message by killing a person . That's immoral. Not for incapacitation, I disagree with Kent . We have the obligation to build es cape proof prisons and safe prisons . We should kill for one reason and one reason only : They deserve it , in three words . In one word: justice. John Donv an: Thank you, Robert Blecker.",1.0
for,"Well, the -- and -- -- you'r e missi ng a point here when you ask a loaded question like that, ""if it could be perfected…"" It -- I -- it's an impossible hypothetical . I'm a law professor. I hate to fight the hypothetical, but what -- You know, if you're making a public policy argument and you're living just as the attorney general in Virginia said, in a fairly land, where you actually believe that you're going to eliminate the risk of executing innocent people, which you didn't mention, John, is a major cost of the death penalty, which we now know is much greater than we ever did before. Not just because of DNA testing . DNA testing obviously has proven that, but in 2009 the National Academy of Sciences has just indicated in a groundbreaking report that fingerprints, ballistics, bite mark evidence, pattern evidence, all kinds of other evidence that we used to rely on think we're so sure are in doubt and we're now trying to get all these resources together to do b asic applied research and make it reliable .",2.0

I'm not 100 percent certain that this ceilingwon't fall, collapse, and kill us, neither are we all, but we're very brave to sit here . The fact is we trust our lives constantly . We trust our lives for a tiny risk of death and for the sake -- when I walk my beloved grandchildren and do it down Broadway where a truck might jump the curb and kill them for the sake of convenience . Surely if I'm willing to take an infinitesimal risk for those I love for the sake of convenience, I'm willing to take that same kind of risk for those I detest for the sake of something much more sacred, which is justice . It can be refined . I'd love to talk about how it can be refined and improved . And one last point if I might, which is they ducked the question and the reason they ducked the question is because abolitionists -- your question, because abolitionists are divided into two categories .

We can statistically calculate how many people will die on the highways that otherwise wouldn't die if we made them safer. We choose to let them die because we think we have other priorities . My point is that justice, which is the second purpose listed in the preamble of the United States constitution, along with ""a more perfect union, and general welfare, and common defense,"" et cetera, et cetera, is a fundamental value that we embrace in this society and that we need to unfortunately take some very small risks .

And you may say, ""Oh, that's two"" -- the Registry of Wrongful Convictions says that, and maybe Kent will say, ""Well, not all of them were innocent .

That's the basic problem of correlation and causation. We -- I often hear the argument, ""Well, you compare the United States and Europe, and compare their murder rates.""

And they conveniently left ou t Washington, D.C., which is right between Virginia and Maryland, which at the time both had the death penalty . Washington, D.C., did not, and Washington, D.C., had a much higher murder rate . Now, I was in Lorton Prison for 12 years and interviewed and s pent time listening to convicted killers in D.C . And you read sometimes in the literature that there's no evidence that it deters . Well, in fact, one of them told me about a situation in which he broke into the house of a drug dealer expecting many keys of coke and found many keys of heroin. In addition to the keys of coke, had him duct taped and a gun to his head and didn't kill him . And I asked him, ""Why ? What went through your mind at that moment?"" He said, ""Well, when I was a child, I used to look through the window of the D.C . jail and look at the electric chair, and when I was on Virginia's penitentiary, I used to sweep the hall and look at the electric chair. And what went through my mind at the moment before I let him live was the electric ch air, and that I didn't want to have that."" That was half the evidence. The other half was he told me the situation in D.C without a death penalty, same situation, drug dealers had them duct taped, and I said, ""What'd you do?"" And he said, ""I killed them because I can face what they have waiting for me here . I just couldn't face what they had waiting for me there."" That's only a single datum, but that is as close as you will ever get to primary evidence that sometimes the death penalty is a more effective deterrent than its alternative, life without parole.  Well, first of all, I'm very glad to hear that we are agreed that seeking the death penalty constitutes honoring the life of the victim . I appreciate that you're conceding that point.Diann Rust -Tierney: I've not said that. On the studies, the pattern of offending across racial groups is not uniform . That's a demographic reality . If you take these studies and if they are litigated and if they are reanalyzed, if you have competing experts looking at the same data, what you find over and over again is that when additional factors, legitimate factors explaining the differences between cases are taken fully into account, that these racial differences vanish down into the statistical grass where we can say that it's hardly even apparent there's any effect there. No, this is very soft science . These are mathematical models, and there's a lot of leeway when you put together a mathematical model . And you can choose the variables the way you want . You can get the result you want. What we see time and again is the same authors who have a axe to g rind put out study after study. And I do want to mention the Baldus study from Georgia, that study went to trial in Federal District Court, and the finding of the Federal District Court was that Baldus's study did not, in fact, prove what he said it prove d. Yeah, I want to dig down and talk about the meaning of this race of victim effect, if it's re al, and I believe it is real. Lorton Prison was the only all-black prison system in the United States, where I s pent 12 years. And I explored this issue in depth. Diann Rust-Tierney says that it shows that if it's more likely, that we will execute the killer of a white than the killer of a black, that means that we devalue black life . That's not true . There are alternative explanations for it. Most killings are same -race killings, whites on whites, blacks on blacks . The budget for death penalty trials, which is very high, tends to be more available -- the money is more available in white jurisdictions than black jurisdictions . The odds of picking a jury that'll go death is greater in white jurisdictions, although there is substantial support for the death penalty in a black -- in black communities, it's less than half . It's in the range of 40 to 45 p ercent. So, what does it really mean ? The victim's family is consulted, ""Do you want me to go death?"" If it's been a black victim, often they have a much more nuanced appreciation of what the conditions were that produced that killing . They realize tha t ""There, but for fortune, my child who is now dead could just as easily be accused of the killing because he ran in the wrong crowd, he was part of a dr ug life, et cetera, et cetera. So why compound the tragedy?"" So they will say, ""Don't go death."" That doesn't showthat they're devaluing black life . That shows they're continuing to value black life, including the life of the killer . There is -- I -- I just want to acknowledge where there is a real race effect in the death penalty . And that's not the way it's administered. It's the way it's defined. That is to say, because felony murder is the most common aggravator, and robbery murders put more people on death row th an any other aggravator, and because robbery is an economic crime andcorrelates with race, that creates the disparity in terms of percentage of population of population of those who are on death row, if you eliminate the robber aggravator from felony murder as a death penalty aggravator you eliminate the racially disparage effect and the other place that it occurs is the place that nobody wants to talk about, but that I became aware of . There is deep prejudice in both the black and the white community aga inst those who have prototypically African features . Studies have shown that the hue of the skin, this is true in the black community, as well as the white community, will influence the probability of being convicted and condemned. That is a pernicious form of racism that is extraordinarily troubling and almost impossible to eradicate in both communities .",2.0
for,"So, I've heard you say this before and it's true, all right, and the -- you say well if we eliminate the felony aggravator then we'll get rid of some of these race effects, which Bob, you acknowledge exist in the system, and we've got to be in the real world .

If a one-eyed person takes out one of two good e yes of a victim he's left him sighted . If you take out his eye you've blinded him . So we've -- I'm sorry . We've traded the notion of proportional punishment. Now, to directly answer your question what would I have ? No, not physical mutilation by any m eans, but I would have something that I call permanent punitive segregation, which means life should be unpleasant . The food that they eat every day, I'm talking about the worst of the worst of the worst who are never getting out, they should eat only nutr aloaf, which is a tasteless, but nutritionally complete patty, gives you absolutely no satisfaction. I saw Komisarjevsky, Hayes ’ cohort on death row with his Hershey bar . He'll wake up, watch a ballgame, and eat a Hershey bar. That's wrong. There should be no such thing as play .  Exercise yes . Play for the worst of the worst of the worst? Absolutely not . I'm talkin g about both. Life without parole is a fundamentally retributive punishment. When we commit someone to life without parole we're saying --",2.0
for,"Bob, I mean, people should know your real position and I understand it intellectually . Yes, you are saying that, you know, logical extension of your argument is if we had that kind of punitive segregation and -- that that would make life without parole a more acceptable alternative to you than the death penalty . Just in case people missed it, you were objecting to the way that lethal injection is done because you don't want people anesthetized so that it looks like you want people to see that there is suffering at the time of the execution . You think that's important . You favor firing squads, right?",2.0
against,I do.,2.0
for," So, let's just look -- I mean, your argument is a retributive argument . You're not arguing deterrence . You're not arguing that there is a high risk of executing innocents . You have a position which I understand, but I actually don't think that that is a generally shared view .",2.0
against," John Donvan:-- hear Kent . My short answer is no . I think the United States can and should decide this issue for itself. I think it's entitled to decide this issue for itself. As far as examples to other countries, I think we can serve as an example to those countries that don't want to abolish the death penalty, that yes, you can have the death penalty consistently with human rights . We can do that.  You hear ""Follow Europe's lead."" Let's talk about Europe's lead. Anders Bre ivik in Norway set off a bomb outside the parliament building in Oslo, killing eight, then went to a n island and killed 69 youths . You know what his se ntence was? 21 years in prison, the maximum that Norway has . But lest you think they're treating him too well, he's right now on a hunger strike . Why is he on a hunger strike inside prison ? Because they're not giving him Playstation 3. Joh n Donvan: Okay. They're only giving him -- Europe has abolished life without parole. Do you know that? If we follow Europe's lead, we abolish life without parole -- not only have they abolished the death penalty . You don't read that in the Times.  I mean, there's a huge cultural difference between various regions of the country . And the countries that have abolished the death penalty, by and large, are those countries that already had lower crime rates before they abolished the death penalty. It 's just built into the whole culture of the state . To do the analysis, you have to try to control mathematically through models for these other factors . And that's what the deterrence studies do . And I think there is a very substantial body of literatur e showing a deterrent effect through that kind of mathematical modeling . I do not concede that -- what Barry said, that there's no good evidence . The report that he refers to says very clearly, in the front matter of the report, that it is simply the personal opinions of the authors whose name appear on that report. There are plenty of other experts who disagree with that, so I think there is a substantial basis, once you do that kind of modeling, to believe that there is a deterrent effect . If I really believe there wasn't a deterrent effect, as things stand now, I think -- I still think th at justice would be enough by itself to justify the penalty.",2.0
for,"Oh, giving little ground there on deterrence, I see. But look, the question brings up the statistic I cited at the very beginning . If you have counties -- counties is really what you have to look at, although most of them are in the South . But there are a few that over -produce death in California . If two percent of the counties in this country are producing 56 percent of the death sentences and 52 percent of the executions, when two -thirds of Americans reside in counties, where there hasn't been -- there's been one execution or less in 45 years, right ? All of a sudden you begin to see -- and it doesn't take much to see it -- that there are just a small number of counties in this country and a small number of states that are engaged in capital punishment in a serious way. And let's be clea r about what those costs are . When Maryland studied the death penalty before they abolished it, they were able to determine that a capital case was seven times more expensive than a noncapital case, that the executions in Maryland averaged $37 million per execution, it's $23 million in Florida, it's $185 million in California, and, you know, California's system is completely crazy . There's 734 people on the row, right, hundreds that don't have lawyers, who have been sentenced to death . And there are some pretty good death penalty lawyers there, but there are also some that are not very good . And we can't fund it. I mean, why would you put all this money into propping up a system where they have no persuasive evidence of deterrence, right, t hat we need all this money to finance an underfunded criminal justice system that has so much to be fixed, particularly when it comes to forensic science?",2.0
against,"Well, yeah, the California one is the one I'm most familiar with, and the study counted in as costs of the death penalty a great many things that are not costs of the deathpenalty . They're costs of the obstruction of the death penalty . The length of time spent on death row was cited as the number one cost. We spend a lot of money in California going over and over and over the same case, litigating issues that have nothing whatever to do with whether the person is guilty or not. And we have been to the legislature and proposed reforms to fix that . They have been killed in the legislature, but we do have an initiative process in California, and I believe that it will be fixed, and it w ill be both a better system and a cheaper system . And ultimately the death penalty does not need to cost more than life without parole. If I believed that were really true, I would be against the death penalty . I don't believe it's true, not for a minute . The author who came up with that number is one of the people I've referred to, who just pumps out paper after paper after paper every time supporting abolition of the death penalty . It's easy to cook books in studies like that. I, too, if I thought there were a 4.1 percent true error rate, would be opposed -- would impose a moratorium until we fixed it and there was nothing like that . I don't believe it's anything like that. Oh, so I don't get to answer that. You know what? I wanted to respond to that in terms of management and resources, but -- and why police chiefs aren't the right people to -- there's an analogy inside the prison about why corrections officers are the last people to ask also about the death penalty, because for them it's a management question and it's much easier to manage without it than it is to manage with it. It's not -- they're not the people to consul t about justice. The states are increasingly abolishing the death penalty in my view because they are abetted by the media, which is overwhelmingly anti- death penalty, overwhelmingly, and which skews the perspective on it . You know, just to give you an e xample of that, the Gallup Poll from the -- not the latest one, the one before that -- had 60 percent of the American people supporting the death penalty, answering the standard question which they've been asking since 1936 . The headlines were, ""Death Pen alty Support a 40-Year Low."" The next year, last year, the result was 64 percent. So it had risen by 4 percent. What's the headline? ""Death Penalty Support Stays Fairly Constant Over the Last 10 Years."" It reminds me of the Russian report of the fam ous race, the horserace between the Russian horse and the U.S .  And the U.S . horse whips the Russian horse, and the report the next day is, ""In Major International Horserace, Gallant Russian Horse Takes a Wonderful Second .  Horse Gets a Disappointing Next to Last.""",2.0
for,"wait a second . John, John. -- but let me -- let me -- -- but let's get to the heart of it now, because let me see if I jus t heard what our opponents are saying . They're saying, ""The last people to ask about whether the death penalty is going to make you safer are police chiefs""?",2.0
against,I didn't say that.,2.0
for," Well, Kent certainly did . He said, ""Ask the line cop."" Here's the point. The reason why police chiefs, who as Diann pointed out very frequently would count in the votes, they say, ""Are you for or against the death penalty in principle or for moral purposes?"" and they would say, ""Yes."" But if you ask police chiefs, ""Should we have the death penalty now?"" as a public policy matter, they'd say, ""No."" And the reason they'd say, ""No,"" are all the issues that we've raised in this debate about public policy, that they see no evidence of deterrence, it's extremely expensive, it's taking away resources they need to keep your community safe, right ? What they need to have good crime labs, to have good police officers, to have good training, to make the community safe, they are saying, ""This is not helping us, it's hurting us."" That has to be respected. Male Speaker:I just wanted clarification from Robert on -- it's related to the media . And our notion of prison is not the research notion that you have, and I think perhaps you might have taken it for granted that it is a cushy type of -- that sentence, waiting period. Please clarify that . And also --",2.0
against,"Well, we're talking about different aspects of it .John Donvan: Okay . All right . So, Robert, why don't you take the question then? Yeah, we are talking about -- if you're innocent you're better off getting the death penalty in terms of your odds of it being proven -- you being proven innocent. This is the consistency . In terms of the -- I'm not taking anything for granted. I've got it on videotape . I was given privileg ed access. I have tens and tens and tens of hours of lifer's playing softball, first run movies of group rec, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The point is that the prison system is being run indiscriminately . It is not on the basis of the nature of the crime you committed. It has nothing to do with that. It has everything to do with how you behave when you're inside . Of course it's a loss of liberty . I don't want to spend my life in prison. I'm not saying that that's not punishment. I'm saying that's not punishment enough for the worst of the worst of the worst and it's often much too much punishment for people who've committed relatively trivial crimes and are put into the same prisons -- -- with the same experience .",2.0
for,"I'd like to just -- --what the questioner said is very important because something that should be corrected . I understand, Bob, that in your view life in maximum security prisons is not harsh enough punishment for people, and you've described what you think would be harsher punishment, but I can tell you from all the clients I've represented, all these exonorees that I've talked with about what their prison experiences were like and some knowledge of maximum security prisons and familiarity with the literature , it's a terrible place to be . You wake up every morning . You have no idea who's going to kill you and when. You walk into the lunchroom . You look at somebody wrong, you can get stabbed. I mean, there are gangs in prison . There's horrible violence in prison . You know, they should be safe, and that is why the correction people, Bob, t ell you that they're interest ed in keeping it safe and that is their job. And so the whole characterization of maximum security prison is, you know, Club Fed or something -- -- it's just really misleading and wrong .",2.0
against,"Under court order I went into every maximum security prison in Illinois with a video camera. Illinois is not -- and also not everyone, but most of them in Oklahoma. These are not known as warm and fuzzy states . The number of stabbings inside the maximum security prisons are negligible . The -- in those, now I've not been to every state of course, and some are worse than others, but the point is not that, Barry. The point is this . Why are we having the same day -to -day lifestyle for the worst of the worst of the worst, and that's why, Diann, you're wrong . This is relevant .",2.0
for,"-- so, capital punishment is not the answer on the issue of deterrence.",2.0
against,"And that's why second -degree murder is not a capital offense . I mean, we do divide murder into degrees for exactly that reason. The heat of passion killing is not a capital offense . We reserve capital punishment for the w orst crimes. A person who commits torture does this crime methodically . And he knows what he's doing. And he's thinking about what he's doing . And these are not irrational in the sense that a person doesn't know what he's doing and doesn't know the consequences . They are bizarre and they are demented, but they are not irrational.",2.0
for,"Let's not be abstract. Sh u ja Graham, Byron Halsey, please stand . I want you to see these two people . This is not the cost of doing business. This is not collateral damage. S h uja Graham was sentenced to death in California for murder in prison . He was exonerated in 1981 . He has been out since then . He is vice -chair of the group Witness f or Innocence . Byron Halsey , my dear friend, w as convicted of murder, a crime that -- in New Jersey -- I think, our opponents would immediately say, ""This should have been a death penalty crime."" Two children that -- of Byron's girlfriend were found murdered in a basement, one with a nail in her head, one sexually assaulted . He was tried and convicted. He was miraculously saved from the death penalty by one juror who was probably motivated by a conscientious objection to the death penalty . But DNA evidence, after 22 years in prison, demonstrated that Byron was innocent and identified the person who really committed the crime . So, don't tell me that there isn't an unacceptable risk of executing the innocent. It's been demonstrated -- the Innocence Movement has demonstrated it. It's not just the 326 DNA exonerations that they can't refute . It's not just the over 1,500 exonerations from the Registry of -- including non- DNA cases. We now know that our system is riddled with error. You go to Europe . 60 percent of people there still think cap ital punishment is a morally appropriate sanctioned for the most heinous of crimes . But they don't trust the state to get it right. And that is what we have to come to terms with in this country -- you can't start saying, ""We can fix it. We can make it perfect,"" when nobody's willing to put up the money, and it's an impossible task to begin with. Capital punishment is a government program. Skepticism is in order. Conservatives -- George Will said that.",3.0
against,"Moral facts exist . This is not ultimately just a matter of opinion . I think that might be common ground with at least three of us . The past counts. It counts independently of the future benefits that derive fr om our actions. We make a covenant between the living, the dead, and the unborn. And so you can't use a cost benefit calculus, not appropriately, not if you're seeking justice . Punishment must be limited, and it must be proportionate . It must be deserv ed. It must be proportionate to the culpable mental state . It must be proportionate to the experience of the victim . The worst crime deserves the worst punishment . We can define them in advance . We can enumerate the worst of the worst of the worst. Life without parole as presently experienced and administered is the only alternative, and it's a bad one . There is no adequate substitute for the worst of the worst of the wors t but death . The question's been phrased, as has been pointed out, so that it's a double negative on our part . So , when you vote in the negative, you are real ly voting to uphold something . You're upholding the victim . You're upholding a sense of justice . You're upholding a sense of proportionality . You're ultimately upholding human dignity . We've seen some victims of the process stand up . I have no doubt that they are innocent. But you can't see the victims stand up who have been tortured, mutilated, raped, and murdered . We as a society have to be a voice for those victims for the worst of the worst of the worst and give them the only punishment that they deserve, which is death.",3.0
