for,"John, I was in the system last night when I flew back from Nashville. Well, I have not yet. And I guess that may come up at some point in the future. But let me be clear, John, if you touch my junk -- Thank you very much. Let's begin with a thought experiment. Just imagine that you work at JFK International Airport here in New York City, and you're in a Federal Express facility inspecting incoming packages that have just been pulled off of a jet that's landed from Heathrow Airport in London. And you're clearing these parcels that can be takenon across America and delivered to their destinations. And you see a package from Somalia, and it's addressed to a synagogue in San Francisco. ""Hmm,"" you think to yourself, ""that's kind of unusual."" So you call over your supervisor, you take a look at it, you discuss the package, and you decide that you're going to put it aside until a bomb-sniffing dog can come over and render its opinion on the matter. Congratulations, you just engaged in profiling. Now, obviously, packages are not people. Fed Ex boxes have neither civil rights nor emotions. People do and we always must be aware of and sensitive to that. However, in a world of limited time, personnel, and money, we have no choice but to focus on those people who threaten to destroy aircraft and the flying public who ride within them. .0 And that is why my team and I urge you to vote in favor of tonight's resolution, ""U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling."" Let me emphasize that we do not advocate letting airport security personnel cater to their own personal ethnic or ecclesiastical biases. Instead, we want the TSA and others to recognize that the current threat to passengers and airliners comes almost exclusively from one source, and we all know what it is, young males between about 18 and 35 who practice a fundamentalist strain of the Islamic faith, and generally hail from the Middle East, as well as largely Muslim nations in Africa and South Asia. There are exceptions to this profile, but they're quite rare indeed. We learned about this profile on September 11 when all the hijackers who attacked us that day fit the parameters that I've identified. .2 Had the security personnel at Newark, Dulles, or Boston-Logan Airports profiled these hijackers, they might have been stopped and nearly 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11 would be with us here today. In a few minutes you will hear from my colleague, Asra Nomani. She will demonstrate that this profile did not begin on September 11 and it did not end then either. My colleague, Bob Baer, a former intelligence officer, will explain that what we advocate is a response to intelligence. He also will show that preventing terror at and through America's airports involves responding to the evolving threat profile that faces us at any given time. Now, mind you, we are not arguing that the TSA should send anyone named Mohammed to be water boarded somewhere between the first class lounge and the Pizza Hut. However, if you are a male between about 18 and 35 and are traveling on a Middle Eastern passport or one from a predominantly Muslim country, it might be smart to ask you a few extra questions, carefully peruse your papers, and if things seem unusual we perhaps should take a closer look at your luggage. .6This really is not religious or racial profiling so much as it is terrorist profiling. We want to increase, not decrease, the probability that our security personnel will stop terrorists before they can board passenger jets, and once again turn them into bombs and missiles. This differs little from what police departments do today to deploy their limited resources in order to raise the odds of successfully reducing crime. If the NYPD were seeking a mafia hit man who just flew in from Naples to whack somebody, I doubt the NYPD would dispatch squad cars to 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. If you set up a sobriety checkpoint, if you’re a police department, you most likely would put it somewhere near bars, not close to churches. Similarly, if a wave of bank robberies were committed by a black man between ages 45 and 50, and if he were just under six feet tall, and lived in Manhattan’s East Village, I would not be shocked if the police stopped me and asked me a few questions. .0 Why? I perfectly fit that profile. Now, would that leave me thrilled and delighted? Probably not, but I would know that these law enforcement officers were doing their jobs, and that, I would understand. Does my team advocate violating people’s rights? Absolutely not. Remember, among the rights that officials need to protect is the right to fly on a plane and assume that it will land at your destination with you and your fellow passengers alive and well at your destination. That right deserves maximum attention from those who we pay to keep us safe from those who want us dead. Our opponents might say that the profile we've identified would miss someone like Timothy McVeigh, the non-Muslim man who blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. However, to look more carefully at someone does not mean that you ignore everyone else. This resolution is not an either/or proposition. .4 Terrorist profiling can exist with wisely applied traditional screening measures for other passengers. Finally, what if we avoid terrorist profiling? At best, we will keep wasting scarce resources by subjecting everyone to the same time consuming often humiliating searches that have generated such public outrage recently. The TSA can keep checking the prosthetic breasts of American women who have endured mastectomies as happened a few months ago to Cathy Bossi, a 32-year veteran airline employee. At worst, TSA officers might come face-to-face with a bomb-wielding passenger who fits the terrorist profile but then breezed him through security because they don’t want to make him uncomfortable. The result could be a deadly airborne attack that we all have feared since September 11. My team wants to prevent this from happening and we hope you do, too. Please join us in supporting tonight’s resolution, “U.S. Airports should use racial and religious profiling.” Thank you very much. "
against,"Well I started off just trying to find out what happened to my brother that day and it evolved into essentially becoming a political activist. But I would just basically say I’m a troublemaker and I hope to cause some troubles for those guys over there tonight.   .9 I stand in opposition to the resolution that U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling and I do so not only as the sister of someone who died at the hands of terrorists in the cockpit of his commercial airliner but also as someone who worked in that industry for many years. I did so in the late 1970s into the 80s at a time when aviation became the obsessive focus of international terrorists and trans-national terrorist organizations. It is different now. It has evolved and it has gotten a lot more complicated. The environment up there is basically the same. The reason for my opposition is simple. It simply doesn’t work. It results in a waste of time and resources. It is counterproductive and by that I mean it causes more harm than any good, any putative good. .0 For those of you sitting in this audience who are neither Arab looking nor South Asian looking, I ask you to contemplate, think back the last time you were at the airport if you were ever pulled out of line when you didn’t expect it and you hadn’t said or done anything wrong and maybe even treated a little peremptory way because the airport recently maybe an unexpected engagement that was quite unwanted and maybe even by your definition quite humiliating. I ask you, for those of you who have been through that who are not Arab looking or South Asian looking or Muslim looking, I ask you to consider what it would be like to experience that every time you go to the airport on every time you fly. It would appear to you, it would feel not like a security measure but agrave injustice because you would be singled out, not for anything you said or did, as I said, you would be singled out simply for the level of melatonin in your skin. .1 And make no mistake, the TSOs who are doing this will not know what country you are from. In fact U.S. travel documents don’t indicate that. Maybe perhaps if you’re showing your ID where you were born. But basically when they’re picking you out of the line, all they’re going by is how you appear. Now I frankly don’t know how U.S. airports would profile on religion because religion is something that’s in your heart or on your head. And I believe that there would be a legal challenge if this question were asked at the airport or if it were somehow required to be in your travel documents or your ID. I think it would fail the Constitutional challenge. So what are they going by? They’re going to be going by, what, head scarves. .4 I will only bring you to the example of the airport security video that was published. You can see it on YouTube of the hijackers on my brother's plane going through Dulles. They look like your typical American people. They're wearing dress shirts and Chinos. And there is nothing in that video that would suggest to you that they are a terrorist or that they are Muslim or that they hate infidels and want to kill them. Not a thing. And I thank you, Deroy. They would thank you, future terrorists, for giving them a blueprint in your description of what not to look like the next time they come to the airport.  I hope I pick up some votes there. I'm in favor of behavioral profiling. And I believe that does work. I think we should stop focusing on things. Yes, packages aren’t people. .6 We should focus on behavior because the moment we profile on status, the enemy will seize on it and go in a different direction. I'm going to give you -- try to give you three examples very quick on how behavioral profiling has been very successfully used. There are lots and lots of examples. But here are three that I think are pretty good. I'm going to try and make it under the limit. A guy by the name of Benni Norris, aka, Ahmed Ressam. He was the millennium bomber. He rented a car to get from Canada on the car ferry over into Port Angeles, Washington. At the state of Washington, a very astute customs agent saw him. He had filled out his customs forms incorrectly, so he was singled out, tapped for secondary screening. Her colleague says, “Oh, Diana, we want to go home. It's Christmas time. It's the last car, the last ferry, let it go.” She said, “No, there's something wrong about this guy.” And here is what was wrong. He was sweating profusely in cold, freezing weather in December. .2 She asked him some questions. That went badly. She asked him to open up his trunk. Bingo, explosives, det cords, a map of LAX. He was done. Mohammad al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker who came in through Orlando airport, a Saudi national who was, again, brought -- tapped for secondary screening. The inspector asked him questions. His answers were all wrong. He had $2,800 in cash, one way ticket, no return ticket, no hotel, no credit cards, no visible means of managing in six days of vacation travel on 2800 bucks alone. It went downhill from there. But he got turned around. Basically he was given the choice of leaving or going through court proceedings. He left. The next time we saw him was at Tora Bora, the battle of Tora Bora. He ended up at Guantanamo. And the final one I'll give you -- and again, there are many, many more -- that's Zacarias Moussaoui. .8 He presented himself as a businessman, Moroccan born, French accent, businessman from France who wanted to buy simulator time on a Boeing 747 400, the biggest passenger plane in the sky. But he didn't make sense. And two very astute flight instructors -- I like to say their names because they're heroes. Hugh Sims and Tim Nelson, they thought it was awfully weird that a businessman would be paying for his sim time in a plane that he didn't have any understanding of with 68 100-dollar bills. They pressed their employer to call the FBI, and the rest is history. I could go on and on about the morality or the immorality of doing this. But I'll leave that to my teammates. Please vote for us. "
for,"No, I mean, I was happy to take the train from DC today. I want to first thank all of you for coming to talk about this really important discussion. We all know it's in the news. We know that it is something that matters to us personally. And I want to thank the panel from the other side and my own teammates for daring to talk about something that is so sensitive that oftentimes it is a taboo topic. .5 And it especially is one inside of our Muslim community. It is one that hurts us. It is one that causes me great pain to actually come and speak to you about. When I first got the invitation, the assumption was that I would be speaking against the motion. But after several years of pondering on this really difficult topic, I firmly believe that U.S. airports should profile based on religion and racial issues. I came to this country at the age of four in the summer of 1969 on a TWA jet from Bombay to John F. Kennedy airport. Ever since then, I have loved travel. I have loved the airline industry. I came from a very conservative Muslim family. Islam has been a part of my life. It's been a part of my being. But something very sad has happened in the 40 years since, both inside of our Muslim community and inside of the airline industry. .5 Inside of our Muslim community, we have had the emergence of a very real interpretation of Islam that justifies the attack on airports and airliners and civilian targets. This is a reality that is really difficult to accept sometimes inside of our community. But it's a truth. And I want to chronicle how this unfolded over these recent years. And inside of the airline industry, we have seen Pan Am leave us. We have seen TWA die off. The airline industry is also under great pressure. Airplane crashes, airline security issues have serious consequences, not just on the traveling public but on this really important industry.  And this issue of profiling has been the taboo topic in the midst of all of this conversation. .4 I do come from a Muslim family. I am brown, for radio audience members who can't see me. My father has Mohammed in his name. He's 80-some years old, but he gets pulled at the security checkpoint. And still I stand before you and I say, profile me. Profile my family. Profile my father because inside of our Muslim community, I fundamentally believe that we have failed to police ourselves. We have failed our country here in America. We have failed our world. I express my deepest sorrow and sympathy to Debra, to all of you who have felt the trauma of September 11. And I recognize that we as a nation, both in the U.S. and inside of our Muslim communities, have largely not yet even healed. .3 We are struggling with how to deal with this very real incredible threat that exists out there. And religion, ethnicity and issues of race have a very direct relationship with issues of violence. A wonderful study by the State University of New York at Albany concluded, what makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology. When you combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination. We saw that dangerous combination on September 11. It was the manifestation of an interpretation inside of our Muslim world that justified an attack on an airport and on airliners. There was a fatwa issued by Osama Bin Laden in 1998 when he had created the international Islamic front for fighting the Jews and crusaders. .3 And he established very clearly in his marching orders, “Bring down their aircraft. Have the attack be one of violence that is pitiless.” He was very clear in what his objective was. And I have before me a Koran that comes from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And I want to establish really clearly that this ideology is one that permeates inside of our community, giving young men then the religious justification to do that which they want. And in it it says “Guide us to the straight way.” It's a very simple message. But what the government of Saudi Arabia has done is added into here, “unlike the way of the Jews and the Christians.” And so this ideology is the ideology that fuels the extremism that makes airports and airliners targets. .8 And it's not just the stuff of rhetoric. Bojinka, 1990s, plot by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to bring down jetliners coming from Asia to the U.S. Scotland, Glasgow, airport attack attempt, the millennium bomber attempt in the Los Angeles Airport was also a successful event, not at just behavioral profiling, but a warning had gone out to look out for men of Middle Eastern origin, and so the customs officials actually had an eye out for the man who was trying to put bombs on baggage carts at Los Angeles Airport. .0 And 2007, JFK Airport, that airport where I arrived, there were young Muslim men who said, ""Let us attack John F. Kennedy International Airport because any time you hit Kennedy it is the most hurtful thing to the United States, to hit John F. Kennedy, wow, they love John F. Kennedy, like, he's the man. If you hit that, this whole country will be mourning. You can kill the man twice."" This is the stuff of the operations and the actual attacks that are inside of our community. I'm not happy that this is happening inside of our community, but I tell you that we must be honest about it, and I urge you to vote for the motion that U.S. airports should use religious and racial profiling. Thank you so much."
against,"Because I decided to declassify some of the stuff on my own, and had talked about the militant groups and their linkages with the State, and I criticized the darling of the West, Pervez Musharraf. I was part of the police service in Pakistan.John Donvan: Before you came. Ladies and gentlemen, Hassan Abbas. .0 Thank you very much. First, it’s a great honor and privilege to be here today. I would like to right in the beginning just be very clear about the topic. And let’s exactly focus on what we are looking at. U.S. should profile based on racial and religious identity. This whole discussion and debate about liberty and security is not a new one. Even the cabdriver who brought me here, because I was coming from Colombia, it was about 40-minute drive so we started discussing the issue. He was from South Asia. And when I was trying to explain him -- I was looking at my notes and trying to explain to him what this debate is about where he was taking me, he said -- he stopped me because he was listening to the NPR the whole day, he said, ""Well, you are talking about these Swedish grandma, Swedish grandmas who have to be patted down."" And I said, ""No, this is not -- be focused --."" .2 The central issue I would argue is not about the different ways and mechanisms and the different strategies, that will be used in profiling, there are three fundamental issues, the first and the foremost is about whether it is legal and constitutional, secondly, what law enforcement tells you, what these different police organizations, there are so many people who are involved in the security sector, what is their general consensus, and the third, and I think a very important point, is what is the impact of this policy on the social fabric of society? First, very clearly, it is illegal and unlawful.  When we are saying that a person of a certain religious identity, certain religious belief will be checked, how will you do that? You'll ask them -- as Debra rightly pointed out, whether you'll ask them to bring their ID cards, or you will ask, Muslims within the United States about five million or so and all Muslims from around the world to bring an ID, whether they are Muslim. .0 So by that definition, and I’ll have to ask them to also to bring this ID whether they’re Christian, whether they’re Jewish, whether they’re Hindu. My argument is that is in principle a violation of the Constitution. Let’s leave even this argument on the side and let me move on to something which is more profound which is that this kind of religious profiling and racial profiling is not something which is an isolated thing at the airport. This is something which transcends, you start looking at that community in a way that is “Okay these are the guys who are always stopped at the airport because they pose a certain threat.” It has an impact on the job opportunities for that community. It has an impact on their status in society. It has an impact on the kids. .8 And I give you a few examples also about how perhaps later on, examples which tell you what the kids from these communities, Muslim community here we are talking about, go through because then there is a threatened environment where you blame the whole community and to Asra with all due respect. I am absolutely not ready to apologize for all the bigots and the narrow-minded people who conduct terrorism. I would argue, just look at the data bases. There’s a new study which is not mentioned, only in the academic circles, but was mentioned in 2010 on CNN. It tells you very clearly that the whole threat about extremism coming from the Muslims is an exaggerated thing. Look at the latest Rand study, it’s a major think tank, it’s not some small research institute in some corner. It’s a major think-tank getting funding from U.S. government also. Rand Corporation says the total number of terrorism incidences which involved radicals from the U.S. .6 --were 46. In some cases there was only one person involved, in other cases, about three people. It’s another matter how many of them were convicted. But just compare this data set which is on the FBI’s website. Compare the total number of terrorist attacks within the United States from 1970 to 2009. It is so very clear. The number of terrorist attacks, for example, those that were happening in 1970’s where much more lethal, from much more diverse communities. So the larger argument I am making is we need smarter strategies. We need strategies which will be able to utilize with limited resources. Another issue, related to this is, this often is a cover-up, a cover-up for bureaucratic incompetence and their failures. It’s very easy for them to say because we our intelligence has failed because of all the different ways we could have profiled those terrorists have failed, if you cannot distinguish between a Pakistani Taliban or an Afghan Taliban and so many other groups. .1 The tendency is to just call all of them al Qaeda, on one side, just call--on the other side are people who are Taliban. It is very important to note how many of these groups are posing a terror threat to the United States. I’m not interested in the total number of terrorist attacks all over the world. The suicide bombers in Sri Lanka or what’s happening with the Islamic movement in Uzbekistan in Central Asia or the suicide attacks in Pakistan for that matter. I am as a Pakistani-American interested in those people who are attacking or who are posing a direct threat to the United States. Look at the data set in the last nine years and it will make it very obvious. One last personal anecdote and there are many other arguments about the legality of the whole issue that I’ll come to later, I would even argue that racial and religious profiling is already taking place. Just a brief anecdote. .6 I have hardly a minute or so to tell you. I am an academic. I teach at Columbia, previously at Harvard as was mentioned. About six, seven months ago I was invited to go and give a lecture to the NATO officers in Germany who were about to be deployed to Afghanistan. And on the way back and by the way the last 10 years despite all my academic work and my work about militants, I always am screened and that’s fine. As a former law enforcement officer, here I agree . I’m absolutely fine with that. But if I am stopped every time. The last time the question I was asked “So what were you teaching.” I said “About terrorism.” They said “Really? So did the NATO officers pay you?” I said yes. “Whether that cash is in your bag?” I said “No, that cash is not in my bag.” But I was stunned. I would like to tell you and I am about to be done with my time, my question is I’m fine when I’m profiled. .4 But when I’m traveling with my family and every time my daughters ask me, after four hours of waiting that “Baba, Dad, are you a criminal? Have you committed some terrorist attack?” I would like to --"
for,"I guess so. I was starting to get thick around the middle, yes. It's true. .8John Donvan: Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Baer.  You know, all these arguments are telling. But I'm going to approach profiling from -- first I'd like to say that I have a daughter from Pakistan. And I have a lot of Pakistani visas. And she's from Faisalabad, it's from a center of terror, a lot of terrorists have come there. And I would fit that profile as well. And I'll say it now. I don't mind being stopped. And I have been stopped. But we have -- you have to look at this -- what I think is a mistake is if we let this devolve, this argument, into Islam against the West or the United States against the West. Let me take an example. It may seem a bit facetious, but it's a very real one. The secret service has a source inside the Aryan brotherhood. .3 A source says there's going to be an attempt on a black American president. It's going to take place inside Washington, D.C. And that's all the details I have. Maybe it's going to be a rocket. Maybe it's going to be a service to air missile that can hit a helicopter. The D.C. police are informed, the FBI, Homeland Security. And all we know at this point is it's probably going to take place in a week. What does the secret service do the FBI. They do triage. They are going to be looking for white males with tattoos, short haircuts, frequenting certain places of a certain economic stature. Those people are going to be profiled. So I think it's important to get away from this is a crusade against Islam because that's not what it is. Let's take the Israelis. .9 Whatever side you come down on that, they have a certain experience in the Middle East. Call it profiling, call it what you will. I was in Lebanon in the '80s. And their assumption when they invaded in 1982 is they were going to have a problem with Palestinian Muslims. By 1987, the problem was not with Palestinian Muslims. It was with Christian women. First suicide bombers were Christian and women. Their profile went from religion to a fairly light Maronite and orthodox Christians. The whole idea of profiling has to do with triage. If you're TSA or the FBI or the CIA, you have a limited amount of time, and you have to understand the background and the religion of people. Let's take Iran today. Everybody calls it a terrorist state. .8 But give me one example when an Iranian has committed suicide either on a plane or a car bomb or anywhere else. They just don't do it. Look at the history going back to1980. Yes, they did on the front. But they were never involved in terrorism. If I am the TSA supervisor, and you have a plane and a threat, and you can only check a certain amount of people, I would write off the Iranians first of all. Within Islam, there is profiling in Saudi Arabia. They can pinpoint the cities, the villages and the school of Islam that is likely to commit suicide bombings. When's the last time there's been a bombing on a Saudi airline? Hasn't been one. They know who's getting on. And they can identify the religious school which happens to be Hanafi, that has a proclivity for this. .3 Yes, they profile. But at the end of the day, we -- the problem is we are a liberal society. Our intelligence, having served 21 years in the CIA and having tried and failed many times, is not good. We are not the Israelis. The Israelis know every single Palestinian, who gets on, who's safe, who needs to be searched, who doesn't.  You can take PETN and you can insert it in a cavity, and the chances of a scanner picking this up are remote. Behavior, look at the 9/11 bombers. They went to bars the night before. They were drinking. If the FBI had been after them, they wouldn't have fit a profile for -- nothing in their behavior before -- they didn't go to the mosque. .6 They didn't do any preaching, anything like that. And once they got on the airplane, I have seen the film. They looked pretty normal to me. But had TSA been around, and had they looked at this, they could have figured out where those -- the muscle 15 came from in Saudi Arabia, and say, yes, that school of Islam had a proclivity for doing suicide bombings. Another thing, we go back to triage and why this profiling is in a sense repulsive because it is based on a certain amount of racism. Let's face it. But there isn't a choice. And because the triage changes from day to day, you look at the Tamils, there's still a war going on. If you're at JFK, and you get a threat to Air India, it's going to be a suicide bomber, and Air India and TSA have to go through triage. They are going to be looking at people who are darker, because the Tamils are. .8 They're Hindus. They have certain names. And in no way is this -- you are selecting them out for a secondary search. This will happen in almost any good airport in the world. I just came back from Sydney. They stopped me. They wanted to know who I was. I'm white, middle class. Don't look like a suicide bomber. But they did a credit check at the airport, pulled me aside because I was an American. I realize it doesn’t have anything to do with religion, but they profiled me. They established who I was. I was let on that airplane. So this is why I urge that as difficult a decision it is, that we have toprofile to help our intelligence services. And there isn't a choice."
against,"Actually, John, I was the second secretary from the time of 9/11. I was the head of the criminal division of the Department of Justice. And it was my responsibility to track the hijackers and be part of the first efforts to prevent this from happening again. And, of course, I carried that on when I was secretary of Homeland Security, where my top priority, frankly, was making sure it didn't happen again. And I am pleased that it didn't, and it hasn't yet. But it's a constant struggle. The answer is -- There was a debate. And we sat at various times with the professionals, people with lots of experience at border protection and aviation protection and the FBI. .6 And there was a unanimous belief that racial and religious profiling would be not only ineffective, but counterproductive from a security standpoint. I want to -- I want to praise my adversaries because they've done on eloquent job of arguing for a different proposition than the one you were asked to vote on a few moments ago. The proposition here is, do we engage in racial or religious profiling? And the answer to that, I submit, is no. The proposition they argued for is do we engage in behavioral profiling. Do we look at characteristics of people's behavior, where they went to school, where they traveled, things that they might have done, people they might have known. And do we use that as part of the basis for determining whether we need to take a closer look at them. And I think the answer to that is yes. That's good law enforcement. It's good intelligence. But it's not based on race or religion. .2 It's based upon things that people do, places they go, schooling they've had, people they associate with, people they communicate with, people who buy their tickets. You know, Robert Baer talked about the 9/11 hijackers not being susceptible to behavioral profiling. I had the responsibility for investigating that and for authorizing the prosecution of Moussaoui, and I can tell you, had we in fact examined their behavior going back over a period of time, we would have seen the connections to radicals and extremists that would have tipped us off, that we should have taken a closer look. That's a great argument for behavioral profiling, it's a lousy argument for racial or religious profiling. You know, Deroy talked about the class of people that he thinks we ought to be looking at, what race and what religion, and the problem is that it's the wrong set of principles to apply here. What is the race we ought to look at? He said, ""Well, we ought to look at people who are Arabs or people from Muslim countries."" .7 Well, does that mean Indians, for example, most of whom were Hindu, some of whom were Buddhists? Does it mean people of Asian descent who live in South Africa? What about Africans and African-Americans? Abdulmutallab came from Nigeria. Does that mean Deroy ought to be pulled aside because he's an African-American? The sad reality is that there is no single group, ethnicity or a group signified by its appearance, that you can identify by looking at them in a way that will tell you that they are an extremist or not an extremist. Let's talk about some of the more notable terrorists that have been apprehended in the last nine years. There's Jose Padilla, not from South Asia, a converted Muslim, came from Chicago. There's Bryant Neal Vinas, came from Long Island, his parents were Catholic, he converted, he went to Pakistan, he trained, he came back to try to blow up subways. Daniel Maldonado went to Somalia. He was born in New Hampshire, again, Catholic parents, converted. .2 None of this would be evident to the naked eye if this person went through the airport. How about this, would you stop, for example, Debra Burlingame as opposed to Asra? Well, according to my adversaries, they'd stop Asra but not Debra because she's blonde and Caucasian. Here's the problem, Colleen LaRose, 46-year-old, blonde hair, blue eyes, Philadelphia, radical extremist, sought to recruit others to blow up a cartoonist in Denmark. On the internet she said, ""I can evade detection because I do not look like everybody's conception of what an extremist is."" And then there was Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, her co-conspirator, another blonde woman, this one with a six-year-old child, who was pregnant. She was another extremist radical. Deroy says, ""Well, we ought to look at males because we know the males are the ones who are the terrorists."" LTTE, the extremist group in Sri Lanka, has trained female suicide bombers, including one who in April, 2006, masqueraded as a pregnant woman in order to kill eight people and wound 27 others. .3 The problem with using racial and religious profiling is it takes you down a road to looking at people who you don’t need to look at and avoiding looking at people that you should look at. The fact is it would be an engraved invitation to al-Qaeda to recruit exactly the kind of people who don’t fit the profile. And this is not speculation. I said this publicly when I was in office, and it’s been said by everybody in the intelligence community, we know that the targeting that al-Qaeda has undertaken in the last four or five years in terms of recruitment has been deliberately aimed at Westerners who have Western passports who don’t fit the stereotype of what a Muslim looks like and who therefore can pass under the principle of racial and religious profiling while we’re spending our time looking at Asra, who we really shouldn’t be worried about. .6 Finally of course I guess there’s the argument that, ""Well, maybe we don’t look at people’s race because if we do that, based on our past experience, it’s going to basically include everybody, including blonde-haired blue-eyed women like Colleen LaRose and Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, but we ought to look at religion.” But here’s the problem, how are we going to look at religion? Are we going to ask people at the airport what your religion is? Do you think the terrorists are going to say, ""Oh, I’m a Muslim""? No, they’re going to say, ""I’m a Presbyterian."" They’re going to walk in with a big cross, if not a nun’s habit. I mean, the reality is these people are not stupid, and the more you target on obvious but misleading characteristics, the more you invite them to recruit in a pool that doesn’t meet that set of preexisting prejudices and biases. Look, if I believed that it was a foolproof way to tell from someone’s appearance who is dangerous when they get on an airplane, I would say political correctness be dammed, let’s pick people who meet that appearance. .7 Certainly when we have a description of somebody, a particular person, and we’ve had this experience, we will absolutely look to people who fit that description. But the problem is, the proposition that is argued here doesn’t meet those standards. I challenge the adversaries to tell you what is the race, what is the appearance that they would rely upon? I challenge them to tell you how are they going to know what religion people are? Are we going to have to start putting religion on our driver’s license? Should we wear little arm bands? Well, we don’t want to go down that road. We know where that wound up 50 or 60 years ago. I suggest to you, as hard as it is, and it’s tough because we all know that we personally are not terrorists and we don’t like to be searched. But more important when you get on an airplane is we want to be sure the person next to us isn’t a terrorist. And the way to do that is look at behavior, to use intelligence and frankly sometimes to use scanning and screening tools but not to rely upon racial or religious pre-conceptions which will only mislead us and ultimately, frankly, probably cause more damage than good.  "
for,"He’s got visa stamps from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan so you’ve got travel through some of these nations that are problematic. .1 And I think basically there’s the idea that we have a religion that you know characterizes all of the attacks that we’ve talked about. I mean, I’m really glad that Michael, Debra and Hassan chronicled for us who the attackers have been. What is the one distinguishing characteristic of all of them? They’re Muslims. We cannot deny that fact. We don’t pretend to have the answers on how we’re going to profile well, I’ll be honest with you. This is something that we have to identify. But the truth is that if we exclude religion and religiosity and interpretation of religion in our assessment of risk as was done to my father then we are not being honest about the threat as it exists today. Well you know, does it make any sense what we’re doing with the pat-downs? You know, what was happening was that, I think, we’ve got this very impractical approach to security at airports right now and what I really believe we need to do is get a more common sense approach. We need to really look at who the adversary is and be very realistic about those type of individuals. So my dad may not fit because also there is as Deroy mentioned in the research a clear age in which the threat has been coming from, age from about 20 to 30. And so I would love, if I could, to ask a question of Hassan. I was really glad that you mentioned the RAND report. I think you have it. What’s the name of it again?Hassan Abbas: The report, Okay, so would-be warriors, an important point. .3 Hassan, what did the report establish related to the ethnicities of the individuals? There were 125 individuals that they looked at. And so do you remember what some of the ethnicities were that they chronicled?"
against," They have chronicled in some cases, people who were radicalized within the U.S., someone who is born and raised here. For instance, I am no more interested in the ethnic background of that person who is born and raised here, whose equal right to be American or not."
for,But it's really interesting because --
against,-- and so how is that relevant?
for,"It's really interesting because, I mean, I really recommend Hassan's book, which is “A Drift into Extremism,” which chronicles incredibly the militancy inside of Pakistan. And in fact in this RAND report, what they established was very clear ethnic groups from which unfortunately this radicalism has emerged. And what are those nations? Pakistani, Yemeni, Jordanian, Egyptian, Iraqi, Lebanese, Palestinian origin. And what connects them?  .4 I mean, it is a sad reality, but unfortunately, these boys, our lost sons --"
against,"I think the problem is this. Asra, I don't disagree that there is an ideology that ferments and motivates extremism. The difficulty is that ideology is only a small percentage of the total population of the religion, that people who are motivated to get violent. And it's not evident on the face of the person coming through the airport that they meet that ideology. Part of the problem is this. One of the -- again, you know, I mean I hate to disturb a good argument with the facts. But much of the recruiting that occurs in the United Statesoccurs in prisons. And it occurs, frankly, with African-American prisoners who become Muslim extremists. Now, they don't fit that profile. They come from Los Angeles and Compton. They don't come from Pakistan and Yemen. How are you going to deal with them when they go through the airport? The problem is what you're trying to argue is this: If we look at a certain class of people, we don't have to look at anybody else. .1 And in that argument, you are giving the enemy the tool that they have told us they want, which is the ability to use our own prejudices as leverage to slip by our defenses."
for,"With all due respect, I mean, we are not talking specifically only about religion and race. At the end of the day, we have to be complete in our analysis. So we have to include religion, race, behavioral and all of the other factors. We don't look at just religion and race. I mean, this is exactly why driving while black becomes a problem because race is the only indicator. But what we're arguing is that include religion and race in the analysis because that's what --"
against,"I actually do, because -- I thought the resolution was resolved, that U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling. .8 And I don't think there's anything in there about behavioral or all the other --Asra Nomani: Well, I don't think it's -- -- all the other components."
for,It's not exclusive. It's absolutely not exclusive. And when you -- When you -- when you --
against,"Because my understanding is that there are people who think that you can -- for instance, how would the screeners at the airport know that your 80-year-old father, what his religion was based on his passport stance because that means anyone who works with “Wall Street Journal” who's active in foreign reporting, they're going to be pulled off too. I mean, I just think that it -- you're going down a road that -- where you're mixing apples and oranges. And I think that, again, the resolution isn't inclusive. It says racial and religious profiling. That's why I'm on this side of the panel because I do not believe that -- I don't know how you would administer that. .4 If you -- if you object to the pat downs or some of the treatment that's going on at the airport right now, how are TSOs, who are the airport screeners -- how are they going to be trained to -- to look people over and employ the kind of discretion that you're talking about in the -- in that sort of flash encounter they have with, I believe it's anywhere from 500 to 800 million passengers a -- a year in U.S. -- U.S. international -- U.S. carriers. So I guess what I'm saying is that I don't see how you can put -- if you're going for behavioral profiling, what does race and religion add? And how is that going to be administered by fallible people at the airport?"
for,"Well, the important point is that the motion is not exclusive. That's -- it is completely --can include all of the other elements -- -- that are part of our issue. I would agree with what Asra's saying. As I pointed out in my opening remarks -- -- this is not an either/or proposition. .4 I believe that we ought to include, in our airport activities, racial and religious profiling. But nothing here in the resolution says that would be to the exclusion of behavioral profiling or anything else. I think we want to look at all of these things and this -- as we are doing now, we need to include this. This is clearly what -- clearly what is the threat we face today. And I think it's important to point out, as I think we've alluded, that the threat profile can change. We heard earlier about Puerto Rican terrorists. There is a wonderful bar here in town called Front’s Tavern . That was blown up by people who wanted Puerto Rican independence back in the 1970s. Even earlier than that, back in the 1950s, they opened fire on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Well, over time, people who were interested in independence for Puerto Rico have expressed that through peaceful means. There is no longer a violence profile regarding people who are interested in Puerto Rican independence. It's really not something which we check for. At the moment, however, those people who we do see as targeting our aircraft and people upon them happen, almost always, to be people who are Islamic and very often from the Middle East. .0 John Donvan:Michael Chertoff."
against,But Deroy.  The Hispanic names I mentioned were not Puerto Rican terrorists. They were Islamist extremists.
for,That's exactly the point I'm making. Precisely the point I'm making.
against,Are you advocating that we -- And I --

against,And you're asking --
for,"Let's try this. Well, how --"
against,Let me complete the argument. Let me complete the argument.

for,"Well, let's --"
against,That will become much more complicated.
for,I'm -- we're talking about adding two. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
against,Asra Nomani: Let's think about --
for,"I go for the inclusive. .3 I mean, you know, with Christmas day bomber, he was from Nigeria. He was black. He had been to Yemen. He was a Muslim. He was traveling with no luggage. Bought his ticket with cash. I mean, he should have been profiled. And part of it was because he was Muslim. I mean, but let me go back --"
against,How would anyone know he was Muslim? How would that --
for,You look at the name. If you -- you can look at the names. His name is an Islamic name. It just does.
against,"Like Daniel Maldonado, is that Daniel Maldonado an Islamic name?"
for,"I think the point – Debra Burlingame Jose Padilla. I'd like to say one thing. You know in 1954, the first state hijacking was conducted by Mossad, by Israel. I would have hoped, if there had been a TSA at the time, that they would have started looking at Israeli Jews. And would I have been called anti-Semitic at the time?  But the fact is that was the first hijacking. It has nothing to do with Islam."
against,"I still want to challenge -- -- the other panel to explain how you're going to tell who is a Muslim since presumably the enemy is going to lie about it. And since we don't, at this stage of the game, have travel documents that disclose your religion, it strikes me the premise of your argument is that you're going to be able to tell just by looking at somebody if they're a Muslim. And I defy you in the face of the actual experience we've had to say that that's possible. "
for,"Well, it's triage. It's never going to be completely accurate. But if you take a black American who just spent the last five years in Yemen, it wasn't for --"
against,"But you're changing the -- I agree with you. If a guy spent five years in Yemen,absolutely, look at him. That's behavior."
for,And then you ask him if he's converted.
against,"But that's behavior. What you're not arguing, we all agree, I think, that if someone spent eight -- you know, five years in Pakistan or five years in Yemen, you might want to ask them more questions. This resolution says -- talks about racial and religious profiling. And we know what that is because we saw it on the New Jersey turnpike 10 years ago. That is you see somebody, you say that person's -- as in the case of the turnpike, black. They're driving while black. I'm going to pull them over. That's racial and religious profiling. And that's what I think we're ."
for,"That's not what we're talking about at all. That is absolutely not what we're talking about. There is a phenomenon where they want to talk now about flying while Muslim to compare it to that same issue of driving while black. .5 But the truth is that we don't have to be discriminatory in order to be discriminating. We don't have to be prejudicial if we're going to be pragmatic. We can be very realistic about this. And just to point out this issue of threat, there have been 60 incidents since 1970 of attacks on airports and airliners. And in 1970, who were the attackers? It was the Jewish Defense League, the Black Panthers, Black September, so the threat was very different from the threat that we have today. But it would have been very realistic and important for our national security and our airport security personnel to target those kinds of individuals because they were the ones who were perpetuating that kind of crime. Our motion is not about figuring out how we're going to do it. We need to come to agreement I think and send a really important message that we are going to put away political correctness and look very practically at the issues of race and religion as they impact airport security. .7 What Michael is trying to do is take us down a path that I'm afraid we're not paid enough to do."
against,"I think to punt on the subject, Asra, with all due respect, of how we're going to do it, really is -- it doesn't do justice to the resolution because frankly you know the proof is inthe pudding, --"
for,"Well, of course it works."
against,"The devil is in the details and I have to say it is quite true that there is assiduous recruiting going on in U.S. prisons. They call it “Prislam.” It's a kind of a bastardized version of Islam. And al-Qaeda, which I believe is a very racist organization, by the way, it courts blacks in the prison population, and they foment the sense of injustices or some people who've been through some difficult histories, criminals, convicted criminals, and they play on their sense of injustice, but they do that outside the prison as well. .5 You have these groups that are the civil rights -- these justice groups that are really -- I do not believe they're friendly to Muslims, I believe that they are really friendly to the enemy. And they cozy up to material support. People who are involved in material support, some of them are even Muslim Brotherhood front groups. And they would absolutely use this kind of profiling as Exhibit A of why you should be angry not only at the U.S. government but the people in your neighborhoods who live around you, come join us. And we know that they're doing that."
for,"And I go through -- I'm pulled off and I have a passport also full of Arab country stamps. .9 And I'm pulled off, I spend sometimes an hour, hour and a half, they actually in the middle of the night call my in-laws, ""Is this guy for real?"" It’s a big pain in the neck, but once I’m on the plane I’m glad they did it to the guy behind me. And what I’m hearing from Bob Baer, you said the same thing about your daughter.Robert Baer: I always getting profiled in Tel Aviv. Well, maybe for different reasons, but ."
against,"I think because for all the reasons that we have said that we can give -- Michael can go longer with all the examples of people who don’t fit that profile. And al-Qaeda, you know, they’ve made some mistakes, but they’re very smart. .7 They’re very adaptive, and they will find like mercury that you know they’ll find the crack and so -- What I’m saying to you is -- what I’m saying to you is that I think it’s -- it is offensive when you’re pulling people aside who have a sense within them that they have done nothing wrong. Remember this is a community that’s already under assault. It pained me frankly to hear Asra apologizing for the beast who did that brutality on 9/11 to my brother. I do not hold Muslims responsible -- all of the Muslims of the world responsible for the acts of a few. I’m not -- -- I do not. And -- I would argue in response to your concern that you feel more comfortable about the person that’s sitting behind you. There is life that exists outside those airports also. We have to look at the larger picture. Those concerns can be responded to if you know that the law enforcement at the airport is effective, if you know that they have spent time researching that issue. Whereas the consequence of this whole issue of every Muslim or someone from one country background has to be looked at as I mentioned, it means that you’re isolating the whole community. It is fashionable today to be very critical of the Muslims. So maybe many of the people will feel very comfortable. .9 But look at it in an historical, larger, comprehensive context that you just are saying that all the Muslims respond, they tell you why everyone is innocent unless"
for,"You made that point. Without an educated TSA, this is going to lead to racist disaster. This is why the Israelis put young men and women, well-educated, college educated who are very sensitive and they do not sit and insult these people. But there’s a point we have not touched on, it is that we are in two wars in the Middle East, that we are killing Muslims, and one war is illegal, the Iraq war, and that’s just a fact. And a lot of this is where we’ve taken sides in the wars in the Middle East. .7 We need some sort of reaction in this country to defend ourselves. And a woman? Oh yeah, I saw their hands. .0 Well I’d go back to Israel. It’s a simple one. There’ve been no attacks on airplanes. They do profile, profile white, middle age Christian Americans and they tend to leave the Orthodox and they know who the Orthodox are. .9 Before they get on the airplane, they profile flight lists before they get on. And if you just take that one example, it works."
against,"Let me -- I did -- I used to get asked about the Israeli situation all the time. The Israelis do a very good job. But they have 20 flights a day. We have -- We have -- we have 20,000 flights a day. I mean, and I've talked to the Israelis about this. The scale of what they have to do is really just trivial compared to what we have to do. It's a different system. By the way, when they take you into secondary, you don't get a virtual strip search. You get a real strip search. I've been shown what they do. They are -- they are much, much more thorough and aggressive. But they can do it. If we did that in our airports, and we looked at that some years back, you'd be waiting in line for nine hours. So I think it's not practical in the context of our airport architecture."
for,"Can I mention something that we do have happening in our arguments today --John Donvan: Deroy Murdock. There's a very interesting article that I've seen on MSNBC.com about a man by the name of Tom Sawyer, no less, age 61. .8 He happens to have survived bladder cancer. And he flew from Detroit to Orlando. And as he was being patted down by the TSA, he said, “Look, I need to tell you that there is a -- I have a medical condition.” And the TSA agent didn't want to hear it. He proceeded to pat him down very hard. The -- basically a bag that collects urine burst, and this poor man was covered in his own urine and had to fly on a plane that way. And so my question to Michael Chertoff, who I guess you supervised the TSA when you were secretary of Homeland Security. What would you say to someone like him who's gone through this really humiliating experience? Why should we call it the status quo rather than using racial and religious profiling in our arguments?"
against,"That's completely unacceptable behavior for someone to do that. But the fact is you get a minority of people who are either belligerent or behave improperly. Doesn't mean that the right answer is to racially profile. Supposing the guy had been a Muslim from Pakistan? Same thing would have happened. Is it just that we couldn't care because he was a Muslim? .2 I mean, that's -- You know, part of the problem is people -- I really understand -- I travel a lot by air. I go through the same thing everybody else does. People are looking for a magic bullet. They like to know there's some way to distinguish the bad guy from me. The problem is, while we all know we are not terrorists ourselves, we don't know who the next guy in the seat is. And until we find a foolproof way to do it, or unless we have real knowledge about everybody who flies, real background checks on the hundred million people a year who fly, using racial profiling is a way of avoiding bad behavior by a TSO is not the right answer."
for,"Up here, which was that we're making assumptions, because, for example -- The person who did the Mumbai attack-- But what I would actually argue is that, for example, in the case of the Mumbai attacks, and this -- this man, David Headley, he was Muslim. He was from Pakistan. He had changed his name so that he could hide his identity. I mean, Bob can speak more to this. But obviously, in terrorist circles, there is something that they call false flag operations, where people try to hide their own identity. And we have to outsmart that. .5I mean, we have to be one step ahead of them in terms of how they're trying to hide their identity. And that's what I think David Headley was doing."
against,"There is something -- There was a question about -- there was a question about what the studies tell us. Is there a data set? There are three or four things, very briefly, I’ll mention. One was an advisory by the Department of Justice in 2003, which very categorically said that racial and religious profiling is not only wrong. It is counterproductive. I can mention to you many studies as my own background as a law enforcement officer, as a Punjabi in a Pashtun land in northwest frontier province. Whenever -- even in South Asia, there are studies. Whenever you try to look at the whole community, then you lose all the people who are the agents of change and who, within those societies and communities can stand up and challenge. So you lose completely that community. All the academic studies, especially, for instance, there is an association of police chiefs in the United States. .6 They have mentioned time after time that these traffic stops, always stopping the blacks or the Latinos, that has not proved to be effective. So I'll draw a lesson from all those studies also which there's almost a consensus, or overwhelming evidence."
for,Let's not -- let's just not -- let's just not make this parallel. 
against,"Well, I think what you should do is you look at behavior. Now, what do I mean by that? And it depends on whether you have the information. But we collect a lot of this, for example, from people coming from overseas. Who paid for the ticket? What's your travel history? What's your telephone number, for example, that you used as your contact number. If we have information that someone has studied at a radical school, if we see literature that they have that suggests that they may be extremists. All that is fair game. It's behavior. It is things that you are doing.  And that's not profiling. I mean, there's no question -- I think we have to be clear about this. There's no question that if somebody affirmatively trains to be a terrorist, the fact that the terrorist camp says Islam training camp doesn't immunize them from having us look at that. .7 That would be crazy. What racial and religious profiling is about is looking at someone's race or religion, assuming you can figure out what it is, and saying based on that, I'm going to single them out. And that is the proposition that was offered. And that's what we're arguing against. Can I answer that one? You all remember the infamous flying Imams from four years ago at Thanksgiving time. They boarded a plane to a U.S. airport in Minneapolis. .5 They called attention to themselves because they were standing in the heaviest traveled time of the year in a boarding area. They got down on the floor and started doing Muslim prayers very loudly. They were shouting out “Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!” very, very loudly. Frightened the passengers all around them because, let's face it, “Allahu Akbar,” I wrote about this for the “Wall Street Journal,” is the last thing that was -- that you hear on the flight data -- or the cockpit voice recorder of 93 as it's screamed into the ground. We associate that for good or ill with something bad in this country. So passengers hear that. Did that prevent them from being allowed to board that plane?  But they called attention to themselves. That was a way that people knew that they were Muslim. It wasn't just because of the Arab dress. Once they got on the plane, they weren't finished. They -- they were together in the boarding area. But now they're scattered in the front, center and back of the plane. .1This is the exact configuration of the 9/11 execution teams. They asked for seat belt extensions for obese people. None of these men were obese. They rolled them up tightly and put them under their seats. Now, remember, everyone's watching them now. And this is all behavior. What I would say to you is, sir, is that the fact that they yelled “Allahu Akbar” and were praying in the Muslim custom, although it's not customary to pray in an airport. And in fact every Muslim that I've ever spoken to says, “No. You can't just drop and pray in the middle of Times Square. There are dispensations for time, place and location.” Once they've -- Once they've identified themselves as Muslim, then you're not profiling any more. You're just being minimally observant. And you don't ignore it."
for,"But what was the religion that was being profiled there? It was Islam. I mean, we can't deny that. "
against,"It was their behavior that got -them in trouble, not their religion."
for,It was religious profiling.
against,"disagree.Asra Nomani: That's the sensible thing to do. And just to this argument that Hassan made earlier that it's unconstitutional, we have had a Supreme Court decision that has established that if there is pressing public necessity --"
for," But if there's pressing public necessity, then we do have to take considerations like racial and religious profiling into account and make that possible. We do it with our visa waiver program already. Those countries from which the terrorists have been identified as coming from, they don't -- they're not part of a visa waiver program, countries like Germany, Greece, England, they are part of it -- because we've identified as a nation that we --"
against,"Why do you think Osama bin Laden sent Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, and Moussaoui, he sent them in the second wave because they had Western passports and they anticipated that, that would now be scrutinized after 9/11. "
for,"and they're trying to outsmart our profiling. And so we again, as I said earlier, need to outsmart them. Well, they are profiled.  I mean, if I go to the tribal areas of Pakistan, you can count on it that I would -- Right, would be -- Well, no, any place we're at war with, same with Iraq. It happens. Yes, I'm profiled. .5 I mean, that's why American citizens oftentimes will hide their passport when they travel to countries like this, because they are profiled. I happen to think the United States is a force for good, so I would -- I certainly reject the premise of your question."
against,"Yeah, here's my problem. My problem is I have a lot of difficulty understanding how we're going to know they're Muslims. .6 You know, at the -- we don't carry our religion around, and we don't state our religion when we buy tickets, and your ability to guess who's a Muslim would have probably have failed if you'd come to face to face with Jose Padilla, or Danny Maldonado. I understand that -- the desire to believe there's some way of separating groups out like this but the difficulty is you’re way over inclusive in some respects, but more important frankly, and more troubling is, you're under inclusive because the guy who you really have to worry about is the guy who is not going to let you know he‘s a Muslim, and that’s the flaw in using religious or racial profiling, is it’s not an accurate -- there’s not an accurate tool to measure who meets that particular profile. I’m going to close with a story, a real story. I actually spoke to this man just yesterday because I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight. He worked for 26 years at American Airlines. He got a nickname, a moniker, called ""The Detective,"" because he was so, so good at picking out bad actors. He was a customer service agent at American Airlines on the morning of 9/11. And he boarded two of the Muslim hijackers that were probably the men who killed my brother. These men stood out to him. They were Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi. .8 And here’s what he said about them, ""They paid in $2,000, cash, paper tickets, they were in first-class dressed poorly, not just cheap shoes, the kind of shoes poor people would wear. I couldn’t understand what people dressed like that would be doing in a first class cabin.” And he didn’t know if they were Saudis. He thought they might be Pakistanis but all he knew was that this picture didn’t add up so he selected them for secondary screening. He said and by the way, Saudis sometimes have people who can’t speak English. These guys, neither one of them could speak English or understand his questions. Sometimes Saudis will have servants travel with them in first class but they’re usually nannies, they’re women, not beefy guys who looked like this. He selected them for secondary screening and he said “I normally walk them over surreptitiously and nod to the agents to let them know be sure you check these guys good.” He said “I didn’t do that that time” and it’s been rough for him. .9 I asked him one last question. I said to him is there -- “Was the fact that they were Arab looking have any effect on your actions that day” and he said “Yes. I didn’t walk them over that day because I didn’t want my colleague to think I was a racist and a bigot.” And that, to me, is what I believe will happen in U.S. airports and will happen in this country. It will have a reverse effect of people being afraid of being identified as racists and bigots because they call people out on the basis of -- -- their skin color or their religion.John Donvan: Debra Burlingame, your time is up. "
for,"Well thank you very much and thank you to my opponents and my colleagues for what I think has been an excellent and lively debate. I think the general position that we’ve heard from the other side is that since it’s impossible to catch everyone who might pose a threat to our country and our flying public and who want to kill us, therefore we shouldn’t even attempt to find those who might have those malicious intentions. .9 It is true that you might, in an effort to catch everyone who happens to be a Muslim, perhaps not catch someone like Jose Padilla who was of Hispanic background and converted to Islam or perhaps people who have gone through “Prislam” as I believe Debra put it who have gone to prison and been radicalized there and might be black and therefore they might slip through the profile. But because they might not go through the profile doesn’t mean that we ignore the fact that people from the Middle East who are Islamic, unfortunately they represent the profile of the people who threaten this country at this time. I think you certainly can check by looking at things like passports which definitely will give us a sense of where they come from maybe not on a domestic flight but certainly on international flights and people going through international airports. I also think that if al Qaeda gets smart and says “Well I guess they’re looking for people who like those who were 9/11 hijackers we probably should go to the trouble of finding women who are blonde haired, blue-eyed.” .7 Let al Qaeda go to the trouble of finding blonde-haired, blue-eyed women who agree with them and want to blow themselves up then it’s going to be a lot more difficult for them to fish around in that pool than to find more Muslim men who are 18 to 35. Let’s at least make things difficult for them. The last point I’d make is the consequences of this. I’m very sympathetic to the point Hassan has made about Muslim children asking their parents if they’re going through questioning at the airports, “Daddy, did you do something wrong? Daddy, are we criminals?” That is very tragic and very sad. But I think the other consequence we must remember is if somebody slips through and we havesomething like the plane flying over Detroit which was attacked; fortunately, the bomb did not go off. If we have something like that happen, we have much, much worse consequences than people feeling duly upset and saddened. We want to keep them alive no matter where they’re from."
against," I would just make you one big request which is not to ignore and always to remember the very idea of America. .1 I would highly encourage you to go and read the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth. Reading the First Amendment will not be that harmful also. So don't forget about the essence. What terrorists want. They actually want to scare you into making wrong choices. Terrorism starts influencing your policy choices. And terrorism plays fear on you, fear of the unknown, fear of the unknown attack. When will the next attack happen? I have heard senior intelligence and security people say, “We are certain the next attack is going to happen. We just don't know when.” Well, these kinds of generalizations at times are counterproductive. I would argue we are not saying on this side that there should be no profiling of any sort. We are saying, yes, based on behavior, based on information, based on intelligence, how do you collect intelligence? Do you think it's all about these iPhones and listening to telephones and wire tapping?  .0 It is about having access to those communities which are at risk. Communities which are also fighting extremists. Don't forget that within the Muslim world in the United States and all around the world, there are people among the Muslims, majority, mainstream, who are fighting extremists. Don't just lump all of them together by your one policy choice. Don't isolate them. Don't lose the hearts and minds. So yes, do profiling, but don't lump anyone together. That will be something exactly opposite to all what this great country stands for."
for,"Debra told a very moving story about a man who was among the last to see the hijackers. .1 What is it that he said? He said that “They looked like Arab terrorists if I'd ever seen them,” according to the media reports when he was interviewed. If that man could have participated in some type of religious and racial profiling, perhaps the tragedy that we knew on 9/11 could have been mitigated somewhat. And that is the motion. We're not talking about persecution. We're not talking about discrimination. I know every single one of you, no matter what your narrative has faced some sort of discrimination in your life. There is no need to add trauma to people who have already been traumatized. But to argue that we will create new extremists is, I think, -- is completely without basis because they have enough reason to hate us. .0 That same Saudi Koran that I read to you, that translation, it says “then when the sacred months have passed, then kill the nonbelievers wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them.” These are people who are not the majority inside of our Muslim community. It's not what speaks from my heart. It is not what speaks from my father's heart. It's not what speaks from Hassan's heart. But there is a minority inside of our global community today who believe this interpretation of Islam. And we have to figure out how to identify them so that we can keep our skies safe and so that we can actually live lives that -- in which we don't have to be in fear. I urge you to vote for the motion that airports should use religious and racial profiling. We need to be smarter than the enemy. I apologize for ending this on a bit of an academic note, but I would like to take a country that I'm not particularly fond of and I wrote a book about, and they're not fond of me either, and that's Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia had a very bad terrorism problem 2003, 2004. Princes were being killed. Car bombs were going off. And we got a new king in Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah. And he sat down with his intelligence chief, Hamid bin Naif . And he said profile. .4 Who are the people. Where are they coming from, what tribe, what sect, what religion. The first thing they sat down, and they eliminated immediately Saudi Shia who were an oppressed minority. But they were not blowing themselves up. They were not turning to suicide bombings, radical Islam. Since then, all attacks on Saudi Arabia have come from outside the country. They have whipped the problem. Of course, it's a home-grown problem. They knew about it. But what they did was they profiled. I would prefer if we had the opportunity and we had the intelligence to base all of our profiling on behavior, tickets, flight lists, the history of people, digital databases, credit checks. But right now, this country does not have that capacity to run an algorithm through every single flight that comes into this country. .8 Nor can it even keep track of the people that are in this country. And this forces the police and TSOs to fall back on a very primitive unattractive weapon. But it's the only weapon we have at this point until our intelligence gets better. "
