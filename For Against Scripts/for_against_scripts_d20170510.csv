for,"Thank you. Thank you for having me. I'm very excited to argue today for something I'm very passionate about, which is the power of video games for good. And I want to start with a personal story. Actually, you helped me by setting up the Peacemaker story. I came from Israel 12 years ago, and I lived in the United States since then. I came to Carnegie Mellon and I came after serving in the Israeli Army for five years. I was a captain in the Israeli Army, and the first project I took upon myself out of my passion for design and technology is to make a game about the Middle East. So, my Army experience certainly helped and inspired the choice. And together with a group of students at Carnegie Mellon we made a game that simulates the Middle East conflict in a very realistic way. We actually used real war footage in the game. And it was a lot about different perspectives because you could actually play either side, and it was also about our goal to generate empathy. The idea that if someone would play the other side you would understand better the situation. The game made quite a splash because it was 2007. The perception around video games was even more negative than today. And it was before Facebook, before mobile games, the picture of the gamer in the basement eating pizza, and we made the game about peace, you know, that you could actually reach a peaceful solution. And we got a lot of coverage in the media, anywhere you can think of. We got a lot community support and NGOs that embrace the game. And we had politicians who played it and lost in five minutes. And something that surprised us through the process was that we started hearing the same quote over and over again. And the quote was, ""I played your game for two hours, and now I understand the Middle East conflict better than watching the news for two years."" Okay? So, I repeat, ""I played your game for two hours, and I understand the Middle East conflict better than watching the news or reading newspapers for two years."" Kept hearing the same exact quote from different people, whether they're in Israel, the West Bank, or America. And we started to try to understand. That wasn't necessarily our goal. Our goal was about perspectives and understanding. So, we started to try to understand, how did this happen? And we did our own research. We did -- partnered with others and did research, with Carnegie Mellon and outside. And we started to understand that where the game succeeded, in which traditional media fails, is connecting the dots for people. When we watch those hours and hours about the Middle East on TV -- or about Iraq, for that matter, or about Afghanistan -- we are watching a stream of linear events. We're very passive. And those events are isolated, and they don't necessarily come together to a big picture. What's happened with Peacemaker was that you made the decisions. You are the leader, you are in the position of power. You take an action, you see the consequence. You start to understand the deep loops of cause and effect. But it's not only about what you do. It's also about the other stakeholders in the conflict. So, people didn't only get smarter. They actually got an understanding of a very complex issue through Peacemaker. That changed my career, made me invest much more in this, and eventually get to Games for Change, and see games that improve all kinds of things. And I hope we'll talk about them today. Which brings me to -- from this story to frame the debate, as we -- Daphne and I sit. This is not a debate that we want to do around all games make us smarter. We are great believers in the power of design and the purpose. It's not like the flier that you see here, each kid that is going to play ""Space Invaders"" is going to become Einstein. That's not our debate. We want to argue that video games are an incredible learning tool with tons of potential. This is what we're basically saying. I want to unpack the learning potential for a second. Number one, better understanding of complex issues and complex systems. This is what we did with Peacemaker at the time. Number two is make players -- especially young players -- better equipped for the 21st century playfield. And we're talking about 21st century skills, things like entrepreneurship, collaboration, problem-solving, system-thinking. Games are great in fostering some of those skills. Number three, making smarter decisions about our life. And here, Daphne and I will talk about things beyond education, because when you make smarter decisions about your life and health, you can actually prevent a medical condition or fight the medical condition, and maybe even live longer. We're not going to ignore risks. Daphne and I will be the first to admit that are risks -- especially if you play video games in excess. But we want to also talk about ways to address it, you know? We don't want to ignore it. We want to, you know, find better ways to deal with it. And what my teammate Daphne will do in her statement, coming after me, is to dive even deeper into her research and research by others and give you the evidence. You know, I made some broad claims here. And we'll get deeper into the evidence later. In summary, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote yes for this motion. I want you to vote yes, that games are a great learning tool with tons of potential. In that sense, they have the potential to make us smarter. Thank you.",
against,"Thank you very much, John. Thank you all for being here tonight. It's hard to talk about psychological damages from technology without sounding seriously behind the times. After all, when TV first came around, people thought it would spell the end of civilization. Even before TV, when movies, the radio, novels in the 18th century first happened, there were naysayers who predicted worst-possible scenario outcomes. But I do think that the Internet and related technologies are different. Video games talk back to you. They reward you. They punish you. They're much more lifelike, especially if you consider something out of virtual reality. And, for that reason, they're easier to confuse with life itself and easier to get lost in and hooked on than some older technologies, perhaps. We know quite a bit more now than we did when the term, ""Internet addiction,"" was first coined almost 20 years ago, now. We know that these technologies can operate on the same pathways in the brain as substances of abuse and some addictive behaviors like gambling. We know that some -- that, for some people, tolerance can set in, which is the need to play more and more of the same game to achieve the same kind of effect, or withdrawal which is this uncomfortable psychological, sometimes physical, state that a person feels when they try to log off. We know that, for some individuals, that their attachment to the virtual world can be so intense as to really interfere negatively in other crucial aspects in their life, socializing, relationships, academic performance, job performance, et cetera. Because of all this data over a couple of decades now, the American psychiatric association has included Internet Gaming Disorder as a condition for further research in its last addition of the DSM. The American Academy of Pediatrics also issued an advisory strictly curtailing and limiting the time that kids spend online. Now, there are many definitions for intelligence, the topic of our debate tonight. But, I think we can all agree that intimately linked technology -- to intelligence, intimately linked to cognition are activities and functions such as attention, reading, writing, memory. And in all these -- in all these spheres, technology has had an impact that's not necessarily positive. When it comes to attention, there are higher rates of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder being diagnosed. And a corollary to that is a huge increase in the number of prescriptions for stimulants that are being given by psychiatrists and mental health professionals. And people have connected that to the pervasiveness of some of the digital technologies that we're talking about. You might expect high rates of ADHD among kids and adolescents. But we see it in adults as well. I work in my practice with a lot of professionals, people that you would expect to be comfortable with dense, deep texts, lawyers, professors, et cetera. And they tell me that they have lost patience for complexity. And, indeed, it's hard to go from focusing for 20 seconds on a webpage to reading War and Peace. So, attention has been impacted. So, has writing. We write online and in our texting platforms in a way that's very different from the language that we learn to write. Somehow, we think that we can condense a complicated argument into a 140-character Tweet, for instance. The contractions we use, the bitmojis -- emojis is endlessly fascinating to linguists. However, they can interfere with language's purpose to communicate with precision and with nuance, specific states of mind and specific facts. Reading has been similarly transformed. Eye tracking experiments show that we very rarely actually read a webpage in its entirety. Instead, we take it in in a giant F shape where we look at the top horizontal band, another horizontal band slightly lower, and the left spine. Again, we don't read a webpage in its entirety. In fact, if you were reading an online transcript of this speech I'm giving, the chances are you would have logged off a while ago. So, our reading patterns are not consistent with deep immersion and online content. Memory has been similarly transformed. I work with medical students who constantly ask me without any hint of irony why is it that they have to memorize anything anymore when whatever nugget of information they're after, a treatment algorithm, complicated medication name, dosage range, it's never farther away than a click of a button on their cell phone. So, whether it's attention, memory, writing, reading, all these things had been transformed. Which is why when a statement such as the one we're debating tonight, that video games are actually making us more intelligent. For us to support statements like that, given this larger cognitive atmosphere and environment that we're functioning in, for us to support a statement like that, the quality of the research has to be beyond reproach because there's so much at stake and simply the studies aren't there yet. They're too small, too short-term, too non-representative of the totality of humanity currently online for this statement to be accurate. So, for that reason, I urge you to vote no on the motion. I also urge you to consider the opportunity cost. The activities that we are not spending time on as we spend hours upon hours playing video games, and ask yourself whether these activities are not also important for our intelligence and for being well-rounded, well-grounded human beings. I urge you to vote no on the motion. Thank you very much.",1.0
for,"I'm glad to see so many of you tonight. So, you heard, I'm not a gamer. Video games have actually earned my respect in the context of my work as a scientist. I'm studying brain plasticity and learning. That is, I'm studying how the brain adapts and reorganize in the face of changes in experience. For very long time, I've actually been working with people that are born deaf and looking at how the lack of addition changes the way that the brain develops. One of the main finding from that work is that there are deep changes in how attention works. Now it's -- in this context that a young undergraduate, Sean Green , and myself, made a chance discovery. What happened is that we had a number of computerized tests of attention in the lab and we noticed that Sean and his friends were really, really good at those tests. These are kind of computerized “Where's Waldo” tests. And we couldn't really understand it for a while. And, as it happens, we realized that Shawn and his friends were all part of the same video game club at the University of Rochester here in upstate New York. It was in year 2000. So, those guys were meeting three or four times a week to play first person or third person shooter game, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Team Fortress, Unreal Tournament, and we wondered, could it be the case that playing such mind-numbing games had such profound effects on something we all value, which is attention control, this ability that we have to focus on the task at hand and to ignore sources of distraction. So, this really set up 17 years of research -- 17 years of research I'm trying to summarize for you in three minutes. And so, because we have 17 years of research we can actually not cherry pick studies here and there, but rather look at all of them together. The first finding that I want to report is that when we look at those people that decide to play those action games versus people that don't play, we do see benefits in cognition. We do see benefits in attention control like Shawn and his friends show. These are moderate effect sizes that are quite significant. Now it's nice, but it's not really what we are after. What we are after, because I'm interested in brain plasticity in learning is asking can I take any of you here, like a young adult, force you to play an action video game and change your attentional control for the better? So, this is actually where randomized control studies come in and you're going to hear more I'm sure from my colleague, Wally Boot. Here in the case of this study, we have 17 years of study -- studies from our lab and lab of others so that's more than 2,000 participants. Some participants were asked to play those action video games. Other participants were asked to play control game, also entertainment games like social simulation games. And what we showed is that those individuals that are asked to play the action game, improved more in their cognition than those asked to play the control game. And there were change again in attention control for the better. Now, I know some of you in the audience are going to say, ""Oh, boy. Like, what kind of news are you giving us? What do I tell my kids if they come to me and say, 'Look, Mom and dad, Professor Bavelier said I can play as much as I want because it's good for my brains.'"" So, as good news for you -- those of you who are parents -- what you should tell your kid is to go and read the method section of our papers. Okay, granted, it's a little bit difficult. But really, learning with video games is not different than learning with any other media. That means small distributed practice. So, what we recommend to get the effects that we see is about 30 minutes per day, four to five days a week, for a period of about 10 to 12 weeks. And this way, you can see durable changes are still there, like a few months later. So, no reason for binging. And in fact, there is even data in the literature that suggests that massing practice with video games, like with any learning, is counterproductive. Now, I'd like to just close by making you realize, I just took a very, very deep dive into my area of research, but there are many other like researchers that are working on how we can leverage the power of video games for the better, with application -- either clinical application insights or educational application insights. There's new journals -- like ""Game for Health"" that have been created. There's a lot of American campuses that are creating new gaming departments, where the best and the brightest students are actually flocking. And we need that, because as Asi said, designing games for change -- for impact, is actually a difficult challenge. And so, in the sense that that Asi and I want tonight to put forward to you the motion that games have an amazing potential as learning tools. We shouldn't turn our backs on the problems, but we should certainly leverage the media for what it has to offer, in terms of being a facilitator of teaching and learning -- of preparation for future learning, some of my colleagues like to say. And that it's in this sense that video games will make us smarter. Thank you so much for your attention.",1.0
against,"Thank you. So, we like to think and often readily believe that the things we enjoy are good for us -- chocolate. Sure, I could believe that. Red wine, even better. And now, there's the popular notion that video games are good for us. They can improve our perceptual and cognitive abilities in fundamental and meaningful ways. Consumers spend millions of dollars each year on brain training video games. Why? Because they're ready to believe that the games will make them smarter, and companies are all too happy to capitalize on this belief. But maybe they're right. Maybe the games can make us smarter. Maybe the companies can make good on the promise of reversing age-related cognitive decline. But what does the evidence show? Are they right? In 2014, a group of over 70 scientists with expertise in learning, skill acquisition, and neuroscience, published a consensus statement, led by teams at Stanford and the Montaponc Institute. This consensus statement concluded that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded way to improve cognitive functioning or to reverse cognitive decline associated with aging. So, in that sense, video games do not make us smarter. This consensus is consistent with over a century of research on how we learn. Video game effects depend on the assumption of raw transfer of training. The training on one task -- in this case, a video game -- can improve your performance of other tasks that you were not trained on. This is consistent with a now outdated notion that Latin training can improve your performance of other subjects. However, the most consistent pattern in the scientific literature is that this simply isn't the case. Training improves your performance of the tasks that you were trained on, and perhaps very similar tasks, but benefits not generalized beyond that. And it's unclear why video games would be an exception to this general rule. Given the lack of compelling evidence for broad training benefits, it’s not surprising that the Federal Trade Commission has been investigating the claims of brain game companies. Lumosity, one of the biggest brain training video game companies in the world, and one of the most heavily marketed was recently fined 50 million dollars for deceptive advertising. The FTC did not find compelling evidence that their games could support their claims that their games could make you smarter and improve your cognition, to make you a better athlete. They didn't find evidence for that, or it can improve your performance at school or at work. Some of these companies, but not all, cite peer-reviewed studies to support their claims. The Stanford and the Mosspont teams did not find this evidence convincing, nor did the FTC. When viewing the websites of these companies, it's important to consider not just the number of studies they cite, but the quality of those studies as well and what can be concluded from certain study designs. So, what evidence do the video game proponents cite to support their claims? Some studies compared the cognitive abilities of gamers to non-gamers and conclude that video games make you smarter. Well, maybe, but that's not convincing evidence. It's like comparing basketball players to non-basketball players and concluding that basketball makes you taller. Taller people are more likely to play basketball just as people with very good perceptual and cognitive abilities may be drawn to the games that utilize those abilities. Gameplay doesn't necessarily cause these superior abilities, it's a consequence of them. To conclude that gameplay causes improved cognitive abilities, intervention studies that randomly assign people to either receive video game training or not are necessary. Recently, a number of colleagues and I conducted a comprehensive review of the evidence at interventions including interventions involving commercial and custom video games can improve cognition. What we found, in general, was that the evidence was inconsistent. But, more importantly, what we found was that studies often utilized inappropriate control groups, inappropriate reporting practices, and also inappropriate statistical approaches that all biased results in favor of finding video game effects. Many studies do not adequately control for placebo effects. A placebo effect is an improvement not due to the treatment itself but because one expects to improve after reviving some kind of treatment. Some of the studies that we looked at compared video game training to a group that did nothing. Doing nothing is unlikely to generate any expectation of improvement. It would be like being in a drug trial and being randomly assigned to a group that didn't receive a drug. Would you expect to improve? Most likely not. Other studies use control groups that are much better, for example, the control groups used in action video games. This literature looks at action video games versus an active control group -- a control group that does something. Typically, the control group that does something does Tetris training. What our research has shown is that people actually expect very little from Tetris training compared to fast-paced, attention demanding action video games. This is another case where expectations differ between the experimental and the control group and any difference there could equally be plausible -- possibly caused by a placebo effect when expectations match the outcomes. People, including myself, enjoy playing video games. Are there benefits beyond that? I'm going to ask for your vote. I'm going to ask you to vote, ""No."" I'm going to ask you to be skeptical of companies selling products to improve cognition. I'm going to ask you to be skeptical of effects that are so fundamentally different from how we know learning works. I'm going to ask you to be skeptical and demand better evidence and also better quality studies before concluding that video games can improve IQ or any other abilities. Just as we should be skeptical of get-rich-quick schemes, I also please urge you to ask -- I ask you to be skeptical of get-quick -- get-smart-quick schemes. Thank you.",1.0
for,"Well, so our research has been used by some of these companies as saying, “Look, video games are great for you.” So, there are two things already I need to correct you, because I think it's really important. We're here to have an intelligent debate. What I told you about is not all video games. In fact, in our training study, as Wally mentioned, we contrast those action video games to other commercially available video games. Sometimes, we've used Tetris, but sometimes we have used Restaurant Empire. Other times, we have used social stimulation games. We actually use a variety of them I am happy to say more. This already shows that different games will have a different impact. We're not expecting broadly speaking to see that all video games will have an impact. Then, I'm with Wally. I actually signed this consensus letter because there's been abuse using our research to advance an agenda that was not validated by research. I'm working now at interactive as one of the founders and scientific advisor when we're trying to do to put some clarity is to go for FDA approval. This is getting the bar really high so that we don't get into this issue of the FTC regulating the industry. We need to be clearly having done all of the registered randomized controlled trial before we can say -- -- this video game has an impact and here, its clinical efficacy. Sure.",2.0
against,"No, I completely agree with Daphne. We need these registered clinical trials. We need preregistration. We need higher standards before we conclude that video games make us smarter. And my point is that we aren't there yet. We don't have those registered clinical trials. We don't have pre-registration. We don't think -- I don't think we have control groups that do a good enough job of controlling for expectations and other confounds and demand characteristics, and all these other types of things. So, I completely agree.",2.0
for,"Right, so, this is important, because I want also to exclude myself from the brain games camp, because Peacemaker and, you know, other games I talk about today, they're not brain games in the sense that they train the brain. They're just really good learning tools. Right. I -- Yeah. I actually think it's a great thing that they can simulate life itself. So, in a sense, this is something that I want to introduce into the discussion -- games are different than most traditional media, by being anchored around systems, okay? Most traditional media is anchored around stories. Theater, film, books, et cetera. There are linear stories with a beginning, middle, and end. Games are systems with rules. So, what we did with our game ""Peacemaker"" and other projects is we took a system. We claimed that the Middle East -- as logic -- you know, at large, and that different stakeholders have different agendas, and we can make a simple model that will be simple enough to be convincing for players to understand the complexity. Now, I can do the same about the physics. I can take any system in the world -- and there are systems all around us -- and do the same simulation. Again, the power of design here is important because not everybody can do it.",2.0
against,"Right, I mean, again, the more lifelike games are, the easier it is to confuse them with reality. I think it's wonderful that there are certain applications that can be pro-peace, but I think a lot more people go online in general and go to video games in particular to play games that are more violent, more aggressive in nature. And there's intriguing evidence now that aggression and violence in video games can potentially lead to future offline aggression – There's some data about that. I would contest that games can be predominantly peaceful, and predominantly encourage the more positive aspects of society and of our personality. And the reason for that is our experience with the Internet in general. The anonymity of the experience, the lack of any structural hierarchy and accountability makes it the perfect medium for us to express less positive aspects of our personality, whether it's aggression, narcissism, impulsivity. Look at how easy it is for people to get radicalized online. People don't go online to become more moderate. They go online and end up consciously or unconsciously breaking down into a more extreme group. So, I want to believe that the Internet and video games can make for a more peaceful world, but our experience 20 years into the Internet's revolution does not support that. It supports the contrary.",2.0
for,"Much more. So much more. No, no, much more. I mean, the interesting thing is that 10 years ago, when I needed to fight that fight for video games for social cause, it was a very, very tough fight. You know, people -- when I -- we introduced the idea of peacemakers to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon so they could support us, it was not the idea, right? Completely crazy. Today, I mean, people that's really -- like me, that really make games and play games and look at the market, it's not true that most games are violent. It's just not true. I mean, with the expansion of mobile games and Facebook games, there are so many games that are about building environments. Look at Minecraft, one of the biggest successes in video games in recent history. It's a game about building blocks. It's a game about building creative worlds and environments. One of the other big successes of video games in history, the Sims or Sim City. These are games that have nothing to do with violence or have nothing to do with conflict or competition. So, I don't know if everybody would go and play Peacemaker, but I know that many people would go and play games that build environments.",2.0
against,"Well, I think we're talking about two things, games that teach specific skills, and I think that's consistent with what we know about how learning works. We can teach you specific things. We can gamify something. But, really, I think there is tension between what Asi is saying and what Daphne is saying, which is, can these things improve your cognitive abilities in a very general way so that you're just now smarter or you have better attention or you have other kind of advantages? And I think there's -- I would definitely say games, just like any other thing, like a good documentary, could teach you things, or a book, can teach you things. Games can teach you things. Does that improve your IQ? Does that improve your ability to solve novel problems? I think that's where we come down.",2.0
for,"So, I'll respond to that question, but before, I want to clarify something because I think it's really, really important given how much confusion there is out there. Different video games have different effects. Different use of technology have different effects. And these two come back to Elias' notion about different type of Internet use. We're not going to get the same effect of using, like, you know, Facebook versus doing search and reading Wikipedia. This -- like different effects -- we need to be very specific. Brain plasticity is something, like Wally was saying, is very specific. If there is one thing we know in learning is that it's indeed extremely hard to get transfer. I can take any of you here, force you to learn a task, you're going to be better at that task. The issue is, does it transfer to anything else other than that very task? And that's the challenge in the field that Wally and I are trying to address. There are right now four different types of intervention that seem to give more transfer -- not absolute transfer. Like, it's not -- I didn't tell you that all of cognition changed. I told you that some aspect of cognition changed. These four different activities are exercise that was mentioned by Elias earlier on, playing action video games that I mentioned, learning to play a musical instrument -- listening to music doesn't do it -- and mind-brain meditation techniques. These are the four that are the most promising that are being looked and studied really extensively to look at whether you don't just become better at playing action video games, but, if I ask you to actually now train as an upper endoscopic surgeon, that they are actually transferable skills. I'm picking that example because truly, in parallel of our work, there's a team at Bes Israel around 2004, 2005 that came across the fact that their young surgeons that where video game player -- especially action video game players were much better in surgery simulators than the most seasoned surgeons in the team. They were much better in the sense that they were performing the surgery faster and they didn't make more errors. That translates into less time in the operating room for the patients and actually a benefit for everybody.",2.0
against,"Actually, I'm not refuting individual success stories, absolutely not. I think what we're debating here is a much more general motion than that, which is that video games are making us more intelligent. I'm not focusing on a specific intervention. I agree with Daphne, especially when it comes to virtual reality and surgical training, et cetera. But video games as a family of activities certainly don't have the data and the science to support a blanket statement that they are making us more intelligent. To the contrary, there's a lot more data that suggests the opposite and not just in terms of impacting intelligence negatively -- but negatively -- but also in terms of feeding some personality traits that have nothing to do with intelligence but that aren't so positive.",2.0
for,"So, I have a quick story that I think relates to that. Sandra Day O'Connor, Supreme Court Justice, okay? Eighty-three years old. Many people don't know it, unfortunately, because part of my job is that more people will know the story, is that her first project after retiring from the Supreme Court was a video game project. It's called ""I-Civics"" and you can play those games online. Over seven years, the NGO that she started made 19 games to teach civic education. Fifty percent of US teachers in social studies and middle school level use I-Civics in their classroom. Now, is it -- does she think it's better than a textbook? She thinks it's more engaging than a textbook and that at least the same level of learning. The same if not stronger, and the engagement level is much stronger. The -- so in that sense if you ask me if our kids know more about the government -- by the way, when she started the old project she said, ""You know, my problem is that kids don't know the three branches of government, but they know the three judges of American Idol,"" right? And she wanted to change that. And I think that if they do know the three branches of government, in my book, they're smarter.",2.0
against,"No, I think, again, -- Well, I mean, I agree again. Games can teach specific skills, but the question here -- Well, they're teaching you ways of, I think, understanding specific problems. That's a specific problem. Does that help you solve other problems, which I think with a good measure of intelligence, not just can I solve this specific problem with a game kind of walk me through it, held my hand and took me through this, does that make me able to solve other problems is a classic way to think about intelligence and these games in no way -- I mean, we can look at the literature and look at classic measures of IQ and these types of measures, and there's no video game study out there that shows that a video game is even associated with game play not just kind of a pre-/post- intervention study. So, again, I find myself agreeing with Asi on some of these points. I think -- but the question I would like to ask is can these games have a more broad benefit and do you mind if I get back to another point in terms of you mentioned replication? Again, not all these studies replicate. I know that from personal kind of experience, but also there are studies in the literature to suggest that these aren't as robust effects as originally made out.",2.0
for,"So, there are -- I would actually be -- it would not defend that we're going to raise IQ as it's been defined in the literature now. I could see ourselves developing another IQ test that is actually showing sensitivity to digital literacy in sense video games. So, I'm putting back a bigger issue, which is that at the beginning of the 21st century, we knew that in order to enter the workforce, you need to have digital literacy. This is not something that we measure very well, in terms of our intelligence. It would be a very interesting test. I don't think anyone has put it together. I want to go back to books -- what we lose and what we gain -- because some of you may know, there are some writings by Plato about, surprisingly, writing itself. And so, in this Greek time, it was actually the oral culture that was dominant. It was what was cherished and revered. And there is a whole debate in Plato, a debate between Cedarus and Socrates -- where Socrates actually laments the fact that the writing system has arrived, that it's going to destroy that oral culture. ""Guess what? We're going to have to go and look at a book to know what the facts are."" And it was perfectly right. We certainly lost some aspects of memories that Elias was mentioning. The declarative memory of these people to be able to argue the -- like, precision of their use of vocabulary is something we have entirely lost over these centuries. We have gained other things. We have gained reading and writing. So, there's going to be a give and take, a very interesting give and take we can talk more about. But it's -- -- always, like, a trade off when you new technologies come in.",2.0
against,"I mean, it is -- the other thing that we're noticing is that not only are we in the digital sort of realm, but things within this revolution are moving so quickly. So, email already feels very antiquated. You know, I can't remember the last time I sent a close friend an email. It's all about texting. And I bring this up to say that things are moving at such a pace that it is hard for the science to keep up with this pace of development. And our brains did not necessarily develop in a way to be able to keep up with these technologies either. You know, I mentioned earlier how they operate on specific pathways in the brain involved in addiction, and maybe this is why they're so difficult to resist. You know, when you're driving, and you get a text message, and you feel absolutely compelled to check it -- even though you know this is not an emergency and you know texting and driving is not a good idea. It's because they're activating certain -- -- pathways. In my heart, I want to believe that. But I have to be driven by science and by evidence. And we are certainly not at a point where we can make a blanket statement about these video games increasing intelligence or empathy. And making premature statements to that effect can actually be dangerous because it makes this easier for companies to prey on vulnerable populations. And when you're talking about cognition, you're talking especially about a particularly vulnerable sub-population, which is the elderly and people facing the possibility of Alzheimer's, et cetera. And to be able to set -- to send this message out without having the necessary scientific backing, I think, is very counterproductive and is dangerous.",2.0
for,"So, you know, to look at it at eye level, it's almost like I think that our students today are in a time machine, right? They are going home and engaging in different activities that largely -- most of them are more engaging than what they go through in the classroom. There is a school in New York that I really recommend anyone here in the audience to read about called Quest to Learn. And Quest to Learn was designed by a collaboration between teachers and game designers. It's not a school that is only about kids playing games. It's a school that the whole system was designed like the most compelling video game. The idea that you always challenge, but not too much because otherwise it's frustrating. So, it always need to be one step ahead of you and in a way that is engaging, compelling, making you lean in. To me, if I wanted to see the future of education in 20, 25 years, that's the future of education, that the classroom activity is so engaging that kids would love to go to school.",2.0
against,"I would like to see video games as a supplement. I mean, I think this is an important issue. Action video games, especially, have been promoted to do a lot of things including curing dyslexia. There are some groups out there that want to push action video game training to improve reading ability. But I think that that's absolutely not the way to go. You want to improve reading ability by teaching reading, the skills that are necessary for reading. I think that there is certainly a way that we can supplement learning with these games that are targeted very directed skills or very directed kind of problem solving skills and mathematical abilities or these types of things. But it's very directed. We can't expect any kind of off-the-shelf action video game to improve reading ability.",2.0
for,"So, two response -- the first one is there is actually great research looking at how to do games for education. There's a whole field called that is getting, really, a revival by having re-understood that the problem was not to translate books to games but games as a media in and of itself. And so, there is a lot of development in some of these games that are extremely interesting for education. There is a colleague of mine, Diane Schwartz at the Stanford School of Education and is the dean there, that has been doing also a lot of research, looking at games for preparation for learning. There is a game that they have studied in depth for preschoolers, a math game which was where they could show that just education face to face corresponded to about one percent improvements in -- per hour of instruction. With a game, they had five percent of improvement by hours of instruction. This is a kind of thing that Asi is looking at. This is not going to come from any games. I perfectly understand that. What -- the reason I am studying -- What is -- sorry? What is smarter? What is smarter? Learning, being able to learn, being able to acquire a lot of information. It's actually interesting. If you go back to the field of IQ, people that have very high IQ are good learners. But you have many people that are very good learners that don't have high IQ and those people are very successful in what they do. So, for us, really, tonight, what we're defending is that, to the extent that you can help people learn better and faster, this is how this will make us smarter.",2.0
against,"I would love to see more research being conducted into this question. I think for something that has so radically and drastically changed every aspect of life, every aspect of cognition, the research is lightyears behind. And, as a culture, as a society, we have to insist on more, on more data, on more science. I would love to see us going in a more evidence-based direction.",2.0
for,"I'm happy to start. So, it's an excellent question. I think that there is this misconception that games are going to replace a whole educational system. This is not at all what this is about. And, actually, there's very good research showing that games are experience. They're experience that are preparation for learning. You need more. After that you actually need explanation and you can get to deeper explanation if your learner has a better understanding of the underlying domain and mechanisms that are in a domain. So, that's being shown actually in physics. That's being shown in history teaching. So, there's good research. You need that explanation. The Department of Defense has known that for a long time, they pioneered in learning through simulation and they always do simulation and debriefing and the learning is happening in combination with the two, not just with video games on their own.",2.0
against,"No, I think games can provide an engaging way that people can explore a problem and, again, this is teaching very specific skills. I have a colleague, Valerie Shue , who does this game called ""Newton's Playground,"" where it teaches you physics skills by allowing you to interact with this virtual reality environment and I think that's a game that's engaging and they're not just reacting. They're exploring a space and, again, that's teaching very specific skills that then are related to physics, but I don't fundamentally agree with that notion.",2.0
for,"To me, the answer to your question is almost the opposite, because in my mind most of the learning experiences that our kids have today in school are passive or reactive. They listen to lectures. They read linear textbooks. They have tests that are a lot of the times are about wrong and right. There's like a right answer and a wrong answer. Well, in my mind most of the true learning happens when you understand that issues are a bit more complex than that. There are trade-offs. There's resource management. There's tough choices to make, and I think that good learning games are about tough choices.",2.0
against,"Yeah. I agree with your concern. I think I'd like to make an analogy with therapy because in therapy there's now a big movement to try to kind of displace the therapist and have people go through therapy programs either through, you know, software or remotely and study after study has shown that patients just don't engage nearly as much when there isn't this active component to the treatment. So, I share your concern.",2.0
for,"Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. You know there -- was in the Guardian. The -- I think it was the couple of days ago -- Harari , the -- He wrote a story about a useless class that is going to be engaged with virtual reality in video games because they won't have any other thing to do. I'm not crazy about a future like this. I'm more interested in a future where rather than isolation, it's -- it looks more augmented reality --",2.0
against,"I mean, I think our automatic -- -- reflex is often to, you know, upgrade to the next operating system and the newest smartphone, et cetera. I think -- in order to avoid going in that direction more and more, we have to be more conscious of how we interact with technology and try more consciously to achieve some kind of balance.",2.0
for,"Yeah. So, actually -- as you probably knew, the MoMA recently decided to curate video games as piece of arts. And so, if you go to the MoMA, there is a whole exhibit. I think there is in the Smithsonian also, that recently did a retrospective on the history of video games. This video game as a form of art that is being recognized. So, if you think that going to the museum, going to the Met, looking at the pyramids, looking at Picasso makes you smarter, video games have exactly that same potential. So, yeah, thanks for asking. There's two different levels. One is, as Elias was saying, research is very, very slow. I presented for you 17 years of research. It took 17 years to have those guys acknowledge, yes, that research is partially solid, right? They wouldn't have done that -- like, we published a paper in ""Nature"" in 2003, and we didn't have -- I would not have given a Ted Talk in 2003. We all know that research has to be replicated, that it's really a slow process. So, right now, there's an experience on nature that's -- actually, the U.S. has accepted to do which is to put very, very young kids on tablets. This is not just video games. This is all kinds of different technology. We have no idea, none, what are the impacts on the developmental trajectory of those children. We have decided it was okay. Like, this is a question. We need funding. We need big funding. We need groups of researchers coming together to accelerate that research because it's a huge worry for people like Elias, Wally, and I and people that are in science. Now, with the video games we have been studying, they all happen to have violence. So, we actually didn't run training studies in children. But we go in schools, and that's actually something important for parents out here. And we test -- we use our tests on these school children and we ask the parents, ""What are the video game habits of the kids?"" But we also asked the kid, ""What are your video game habits?"" And guess what? They don't line up. So, one recommendation for those of you parents with young children is talk to your children. Even play with them. You'll see whether they play at your friend's house because you'll see their level. And begin to address also the type of problems that Elias was mentioning like, you know, too much playing can be debilitating. There is really a need for education. One that's worthy is a great program right now in Geneva which is being launched because a number of us have advocated for giving digital literacy class in schools from very early on and actually getting the kids to understand what are all this different technology, what they do to their brain and behavior, and what are danger of it? And I think we really need that in school.",2.0
against,"Well, yeah, I mean, we're kind of living that experiment right now. We don't know. But I'd like to say time is a zero-sum game. If you're using that time for a video game, you're not using it for something else. So, there are going to be costs that, if you think, for example, that action video games might improve -- or any type of video game might improve reading ability or might improve working memory so that people with ADHD, children with ADHD can concentrate better in schools and they're playing those video games, they're not doing other things that could potentially be more beneficial for them.",2.0
for,"Yeah, so -- -- there is evidence that one of the gateways to brain plasticity and learning is this type of attention control we have been actually studying not only for obvious reasons. Right now, it is the choice of paying attention to me and learn from me. But you could pay attention to your neighbor and whatever they are doing and then you wouldn't actually learn from me, right? But, also, because attention control is linked to the release of a variety of neurotransmitters that have been shown in animal studies to facilitate learning and brain plasticity. Now, that's one answer. The answer about video game is as I told you, not all video game boost attentional control, that's for sure. And it's even more complicated than that. The same video game may boost the attentional control of Jim, but will not boost the attentional control of Joe that actually has ADD/ADHD. So, we know from our work that those video games that boost attentional control in normal healthy individuals don't work in ADD/ADHD individuals, and that's actually why we are working on interactive. We know why. People that have ADD/ADHD get into those games and they don't play in a proactive fashion. They always play in a reactive fashion. They spray bullets all over. They're just having fun, but they don't plan ahead. So, you need to design a game that's actually forces the player to plan ahead. It's actually doable, but again, it comes back to design. There's nothing magical about video games going to be a specific problem and specific design solution given what you want them to learn. No, I haven't changed my position. I do see a tension between, you know, this side -- our side trying to claim that, you know, there are strong case studies and I could name many more that some of them, by the way, go to clinical trial and done clinical trial so I don't think it's accurate that they -- that there's none. But this would be almost like pioneering examples. You know, these would be exemplars and I think that we need to understand the context. The context is it's a young medium -- very young medium. Movies have developed for decades. TV same thing, and not to mention books. We're talking about the very young medium in terms of research, but also in terms of design and -- but to me, the second we can start to identify those very, very strong pioneering examples, some of them like this Sandra Day O'Connor story, are in the real world. To me that's -- that shows a promise, because with evolution we just -- we can just become more sophisticated.",2.0
against,"I want to be excited about the promise. The evidence so far, 20 years into the digital revolution, is not very encouraging and I hate to say that.",2.0
for,"So, I'd like to go back to a personal story. I'm the mom of three children. Actually, they are young adults now and when they were developing in adolescence, I really had the prototypical gender stereotype at home with my son playing action video games and strategy games and my two daughters being much more into texting, into new technologies like, you know, social media and a lot of media multi-tasking, meaning that you check your Facebook page, you do your Instagram, you text at same time, and you do your math homework. Believe it or not, I've always fought only my girls based on what I know. First, because we shouldn't mix old technologies. There is definitely real research coming out suggesting that multi-media tasking, switching between different media, which by the way Steve Jobs sold to us beautifully as you're going to be more productive, has -- is linked to deficit in attention and attentional control. The other reason why I also been fighting my girls is that and wondering like, you know, how can I do better is that there is this really big offer for boys and video games that are potential enhancers of things like spatial cognition, which is very good for science and technology and when you look at the video games that girls are attracted to, there are very few games that have those kinds of cognitive benefits. They are much more on the social side. We are glad they are social games, but we would love to see a better ecosystem of games that are preparation for learning in all different domains for all different genders, for all different background and ethnicity. We are really pushing here and asking you to vote yes for the motion that, “Video Games Will Make Us Smarter,” in the sense that video games really have amazing learning power. We need to produce those video games. Thank you very much.",3.0
against,"So, I'd like to make the case that the evidence simply isn't there yet. We don't have the studies with the right control groups, with the right methods, with the right statistical approaches, to show us that action video games or any other types of video games can really make us smarter or improve general cognitive abilities. These effects don't always replicate. I'd like to kind of make that point again. And also, that when you look at meta analyses, kind of large -- kind of overviews of studies, oftentimes, when you correct for publication bias and other types of methodological flaws, these are fairly small effects that we're seeing. So, those are one thing -- that's one thing I want to make kind of clear. But also, I'd like to talk a little bit more about opportunity cost, which I think is really, really important. If we think about, for example, your aging parent, or grandparent, or just an aging friend trying to improve cognitive ability, trying to improve their cognition, there's going to be an opportunity cost. They're going to be playing games. And if these games aren't improving their cognition, then they're not doing other things. They're not spending times with their -- time with their children or grandchildren. They're not engaging with their community. I think there are costs there. So -- and they're not doing other things that might be more better for their cognition -- might be better for their cognition, such as aerobic exercise or any other of these types of things I think have a lot more evidence for them. Aerobic exercise, you can go all the way from the mouse model all the way to the human model. Intervention studies for the animal models. You can open up the brain. You can see neuroplasticity. You can see new capillary beds and all these other types of things. We're not there yet for action video games or any other type of video games where we have that level of evidence that can trace, ""What is the active ingredient that's causing all these changes, that's causing such unbelievable effects?"" So, I ask that you consider it both a general weakness, I think, of the evidence in the video game literature right now, but also the consequences if we recommend these things too soon, if we recommend these prematurely for interventions for reading, cognitive aging, and other types of issues. Thank you.",3.0
for,"Thank you. So, as you probably saw through the debate, in my personal view, there is an answer to the question, will video games make us smarter? And I would even go beyond that from the cases that I've seen, both in practice and research. Games could do other things as well if they're well-designed and designed for a purpose. They could make us smarter. In some cases, they could even make us healthier. They can help us learn about the world and broaden our horizons. Again, well-designed and for a purpose. Not every game. And as you saw, Daphne and I will be the last ones to say that there are no negative outcomes, and we don't need to address them. And this is my main point, if there's one takeaway that I want you to go home with -- is that point of, how do we do a better job as parents, educators, players to understand this medium? Because what is a fact that I'm sure you won't to be arguing about is that it is a super powerful industry. It's about to cross the threshold of $100 billion worldwide, which means that it's bigger than the music industry and the film industry combined. Time of play on a weekly basis, worldwide, 7 billion hours. Okay? So, to my colleagues, I would say, rather than fight it, fight this amazing phenomenon, join it in the sense -- -- that your expertise -- but it's serious -- your expertise and our expertise could help all the people in the audience and all the people that we'll interact with understand how to deal with it better, rather than banning it or -- I mean, it's not going to go away. It's just going to grow stronger. So, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to vote yes for the motion. I want to you say with us that video games will make us smarter, but also that we need to be smarter about video games. Thank you.",3.0
against,"The bestselling video games of 2016 have titles like Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, and Infinite Warfare. It's hard to imagine how playing these games hours upon hours has raised our average IQ. On the other hand, these games, I think, like the Internet at large can nurture some rather negative personality elements, aggression, narcissism, impulsivity being some examples. There's evidence about violent video games leading to downstream offline future violence. And, for evidence on how online narcissism and impulsivity can lead to offline narcissism and impulsivity, you can find examples from both sides of the aisles from the last election. It's not possible to turn the clock back on technology. This is not something that is feasible nor advisable. Yet, some of us are trying to achieve some kind of balance between our online and our offline lives. But, in trying to achieve that balance, we're faced by two formidable obstacles. The first obstacle we can do nothing about and has to do with how our brains are wired. And they're not wired necessarily in a way that makes us able to resist these technologies and to take them in small doses only. But the other obstacle is huge industry interests and huge marketing campaigns that are trying to convince us that these technologies are actually making us smarter, they're good for us, we should embrace them even more. I'd like to end by bringing up a case of a patient I saw a couple weeks ago. I'll call him Jeff, a 21-year old who achieved one of the highest possible schools on a shoot-them-up game. However, he was so consumed by this game that he was failing three of his classes. I think that the least helpful intervention I can make, the least compassionate statement, maybe, is to tell him that, ""I know you're failing, but your processing speed is off the charts."" I think it would be the wrong message to send him and I think it would be the wrong message to send the culture at large. So, I urge you to vote, ""No,"" on the motion.
