Being brave enough to not pull punches and say when the administration's getting it wrong, but also having the courage to say when it's getting it right. That's been courage I've had to use rarely recently, but that's very important, that --",
for,"I think it was an accident. My Russian friends say it was fate. When I was young, before most of you were born, I was in Birmingham, England, finishing a year of study. I had left 30 days and 300 books. I intended, because I read Hemingway, to go to Spain and watch the bulls run, but I was walking in the working-class district of Birmingham, and I saw a sign, ""30 days in the Soviet Union for $300."" I was no dummy. I got on the ship. I saw five Soviet cities awakening from Stalin's terror and still isolated behind the Iron Curtain. I was enthralled, and that became my fate.",

against,I disagree with the statement that it is not fit for purpose.,
against,"So, the people who put together the NATO alliance weren’t, you know, starry-eyed college professors arguing in a faculty lounge. They were the people who had fought World War II and were really worried that unless the countries of Europe and the United States banded together, we would not be able to anticipate threats as they arose, and the cost for each of us of defending our societies could be overwhelming. And so, the cost-sharing of the NATO allies, and the burden-sharing of the NATO allies, both helped us prevent the Soviet Union and Russia and other countries from becoming threats to us, but it also created the basis for the historic rapprochement between France and Germany, which I think would not have happened if the United States, a stronger, broader-shoulder power than Britain, France, or Germany, hadn’t been a stabilizer in the equation. The argument that the United States spends too much on NATO? That’s true if you look at the entirety of the defense budget, but we don’t use the entirety of the defense budget for the defense of Europe. What we contribute to the defense of Europe is proportional compared to what Europeans contribute for their own defense.",
against,"John, I’m a yes, and I respectfully disagree almost completely with Kori. I think that when NATO was set up, the deal with the Soviet threat -- it made eminently good sense to create that institution. I think that institution did a fine job as long as the Soviet Union was there. The Soviet Union, however, disappeared. There’s no longer any meaningful threat in Europe, and therefore, I think it’s time for the United States to go home for two really important reasons to draw down our forces in Europe and leave security in Europe to the Europeans. The first is China. The United States should be pivoting to Asia, because to the extent that we have a threat in the international system we have to deal with, it is China. It’s not Russia; it’s not Germany; it’s not any European country, so there’s no good security imperative for being there. And there is a good security imperative for pivoting to Asia. But furthermore, we ought to spend some of that money we spend on Europe in fixing the subways here in New York. Your subway system is absolutely terrible. Your schools are in terrible shape. So, there’s all sorts of reasons for the United States not to spend money defending other people who are perfectly capable of defending themselves. Now, you might say the Europeans are not capable of defending themselves against the Russians. I think you’re wrong. The Europeans without the Americans have a gross national product that's 10 times the size of Russia, a population that's almost four times as big. And they spend five times as much money on defense.",
for,"Yeah. I mean, I think NATO obviously -- it should be obvious; it still serves a purpose. If you go around and you travel to Europe, you talk to the foreign policy crowds in all the European countries -- whether it be in the west or the east; you don't even have to go to the Baltic Republics -- you won't find anyone saying, ""Oh, I wish NATO were dead."" They believe that Russia is a threat, and I think they have the grounds to know. I would also suggest that it's rather important for the United States just to stay in Europe for the Europeans. I mean, there's a wonderful book out there -- Luigi Barzini's ""Europeans."" And if -- those of you who can remember him -- the last chapter in that book is ""The Americans."" I think we should know enough from history that Europe is much -- in much, much better shape. The likelihood of turmoil, tumult, and carnage is vastly left -- less if the Americans stay. In fact, I would say it's non-existent if the Americans stay. And I think it's delusional to believe that the Europeans couldn't misfire again. I don't think, yet, the welfare state has enfeebled their passions, creativity, and dynamism. In the past, that has led to bloodshed. We shouldn't want to tempt fate. And I don't think that, really, the amount of money that we spend in Europe on NATO is going to make a hoot's worth on difference on the subway system in this city. We're talking, really, about small potatoes here.",
for,"John, I declare no. NATO is fit for purpose. NATO is one of America's greatest assets. Consider our two strategic rivals: Russia and China. And ask yourselves, how many willing partners do they have -- countries that they haven't bought off or strong-armed in some way? Countries that actually want to work with them, want their militaries to develop together, to train together, to cooperate and defend one another? Countries that believe that an attack on one is an attack against all. The answer is no. Yet, for seven decades, the United States has enjoyed the partnership of an alliance that today is 29 countries strong. Some of these countries are large, some are small. They've helped keep the peace in Europe. They're working with American soldiers today on the ground in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, and they're working with the U.S. military on confronting the challenges of the future. Now, can working with partners prove time-consuming and frustrating? Absolutely. NATO has always had its share of its challenges -- adapting and responding to new threats. Today's no different, which is why the alliance needs reforms to make itself faster and more agile, and why the Europeans do need to spend more on their defense. But that's a far cry from saying that NATO is no longer fit for purpose and needs to be retired. Ask yourselves: would the U.S. be better able to protect its interest and help solve the challenges of the future without willing and capable allies standing by its side? Think about it: if NATO did not exist today, we would be racing to invent it.",
for,"Well, I live on the Upper East -- West Side, around the corner. But I hail from Kentucky, so I don't have any liberal illusions. And I may be the only person who up here who actually rides the New York subway every day. But the question is different. Looming over this debate is something that hasn't yet been mentioned -- the disintegration of what, for some reason, has been called for a generation the U.S.-led post-Cold War ""liberal world order."" What a misnomer. It's not post-Cold War; we're in a new Cold War. It's been only variously liberal. It hasn't been worldwide. Russia has been excluded. And the order that's been brought has meant a lot of wars. So, NATO -- NATO lost its status purpose with the Soviet Union. It very quickly found another -- expanding from Germany all the way to -- literally on Russia's borders. What's the result, then? They tell us it brought security. Where's the security? What's it's brought instead is a new and more dangerous cold war because this cold war has its epicenter not in faraway Berlin, but right on Russia's borders. Along the way, it's generated three American-Russian proxy wars, Georgia, Ukraine, Syria with another one brewing in the Baltic area. I don't know what the real purpose of NATO should be. Maybe I could be convinced it should become an anti-terrorist organization, because I think that's the number one threat to all of us.",
for,But I --,
for,"Well, NATO's primary mission is to help secure the piece in Europe, and that was a success of the Cold War, and I would argue it's -- has been a sustained success in the post-Cold War era. However, when I worked in the Pentagon, we saw Europeans, and therefore NATO, as our foundational partners militarily. Whenever the United States was faced with a problem in the world, the first folks we would call would be our NATO allies. And NATO, as an organization -- it's like a set of muscles, ready and able and capable of acting with the United States in partnership on some of the world's toughest problems. And no other country in the world, none of our chief rivals, certainly, enjoys that capability.",
against,"Yeah, I just want to make two points. One is that when you talk about NATO from a favorable point of view, it's all part of a story where the United States has a responsibility to keep piece in virtually every area of the world. And, furthermore, it's important to have these European allies, because they can help us in all these crazy escapades that we engage in where we get our nose bloody. Libya -- look at Libya. The Europeans were really wonderful in helping us destabilize Libya and create all sorts of problems not only in Libya, but with regard to refugees inside of Europe. Furthermore, NATO expansion, as Steve was alluding to. NATO expansion, which was all designed just to keep NATO alive, has failed miserably. It's turned Eastern Europe into a real mess, and we're more -- now more deeply involved in Eastern Europe than ever when we should be either pivoting to Asia or spending the money here in the United States.",
for,"Well, one, I think we can do both. We historically have done both. Whether we choose to bear the burden is a different issue. I mean, the United States is a unique country. It has born an unusual burden since World War II. I would argue it's born -- the fruit is enormous. Now, I mean, China is a huge issue coming at us. The growing militarization of Chinese politics is a big problem. Their muscle is growing every single day. We need to maintain the alliances in Asia. I think you can check the Chinese, but it's going to be a risky process. We're going to have to stand firm on Taiwan.",
for,"Well, we’ve got to do that when we get to the Russia threat, and I don’t think there’s any. But I’d like to quarrel a little with what I read in the paper every day, though I -- John Mearsheimer can probably do better. I read every day that NATO is “the greatest military alliance in the history of the world.” You all have seen this, right? Well, first of all, NATO hasn’t fought a war as an alliance yet, so we’re really not sure about that. Secondly, when NATO does fight wars, it’s a handful of willing partners with the United States; the coalition; the willing. But look at the wars; John mentioned them. What have we got? Serbia ended up to be a disaster. Everybody in this room, not just those with liberal illusions, would agree Iraq was a disaster. Libya; we’ve been in Afghanistan longer than any other war. Where is this greatest military alliance in the world? Where’s the security it’s brought? This is the essential question. We have a history. Doesn’t matter what our ideologies are, or our political affiliations are. The only thing that’s admissible is historical evidence, and we have 25 years of historical evidence, and what we have to show for it is one of the worst crises in the history of the world before us today.",
against,"Sure. Well, two things. Having friends to fight alongside you doesn’t guarantee that you’re going to fight the right wars or have the right strategies. It means you don’t have to do it all by yourself. And so, the -- part of the answer to the China rising is it’s going to be a lot easier to manage a rising China if, as is now already happening, Britain and France are helping us police freedom of navigation. The Japanese are helping us do that. The Dutch are helping us do that. So, it matters to have allied forces than on our own. On the question of Russia and wars that provoked, it seems to be likelier that we would have more wars, skirmishes with Russia in places like Georgia, if you didn’t have the NATO alliances to rule Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries out of bounds.",
for,"I want to be clear on one thing you said, because it flabbergasts me. I think you probably didn’t really mean it. If friends get us into wars, they’re really friends?",
against,I didn’t say friends --,
for,I thought that was --,
against,listen to words.,
for,What did you say?,
against,What I said was friends fighting alongside you doesn’t prevent you either making bad choices about war or picking bad strategies for wars.,
for,choices? You admit they’re bad choices? Okay.,
for,"Yeah, I’m just saying I’m actually sort of astonished, and I’m proud, I mean, the Europeans have lasted as long as they have in Afghanistan. I have to give them credit.",
against,not affect that way in --,
for,"Let’s be frank. I mean, the welfare states in Europe have enfeebled the militaries in Europe. The welfare state ate the Royal Navy. That they were able, actually, to come out and deploy the forces they did I think is quite commendable. I wish they’d stayed longer; I wish they’d spend more money. But I would just repeat a little story that was told me to by the British deputy commander of ICEF when I was Afghanistan one time, and I asked him about the various European contributions. And he said, you know, “Some of them are terribly impressive on the battlefield, but then again, you know, those like the French, and the French commander comes to me once every two weeks, and he says the thing that makes the American and the British commanders just start to go pitty-patter, and that is, ‘Who do you want us to kill?’”",
for,That is the sign of a good ally.,
against,"I just want to pick up on Reuel’s point that the European militaries are feeble militaries. These are tiny militaries, and the reason they want us to be in Europe to protect them is so that they don’t have to pay money for defense, and Uncle Sucker pays the money to protect them. And the idea that the Europeans are going to help us contain China going to help us contain China is not a serious argument. These countries have no power projection capability. They're, in fact, going to trade with the Chinese. And they'll be -- if anything -- a thorn in our side. If we weren't in Europe protecting them, they'd have to spend more money on themselves, and we'd be free to pivot to Asia, and we'd be free to fix the New York subways.",
for,"Well, look, I --",
for,"We are certainly in Europe to help protect Europe, but the Europeans are our partners as we project our power in the world. Now, we can have a debate of the right or wrong way to project U.S. power, and whether the right decisions have been made. But the U.S. has never gotten into a fight because the NATO allies have dragged us into that fight.",
for,"And I want to pick up something else that Reuel mentioned which was that when you go to Europe, when you go to the Baltics, when you go throughout western Europe -- France, Germany -- you hear this demand for the United States. I mean, think of the drama we had over the summer when President Trump went to the NATO summit and talked about whether or not the U.S. would stay in the alliance. And there's panic throughout the European continent. They're worried that the United States is going to go away; that U.S. leadership is going to be diminished. And think of the reason for that. They're asking for us. They want our help. They want us to be there with them. And that's a very, very unique position for a country to be in. Russia and China do not have those kinds of problems. And this is an asset for us that we can squander with the wrong decisions and the wrong kind of leadership.",
for,"Well, historically, that's been true. I mean, most of us or many of us in this room had ancestors who came from the European continent. So, that's undeniable. On the other hand, President Trump seems to have so unnerved them that a lot of Europeans -- including European leaders -- are talking about going their own way. So, I'm not sure how tied to us they feel. I find it flabbergasting and almost -- and I don't mean to be rude to anybody -- but fairytale, cartoon-like to say that Europe needs us to defend them from some threat. This ancient civilization, richer than we are -- capable politically of not doing absolutely ludicrous things as we have done. Can't manage and safeguard its own -- same -- its own fortunes without Derek worrying every day about he's going to protect them. To me, it's this old American arrogance, the indispensable nation. I mean, can it really be so today? And by the way -- we'll come to it later -- what's the threat to Europe? Please don't tell me Russia's a threat to Europe.",
for,"Yeah. I just have to say -- I mean, whatever you think of America's various adventures since World War II, there's simply no comparison with the ludicrous, bloody adventures of Europe in the 20th century. And the notion that somehow the Europeans are all cured and all adults now, and will behave, and do the right thing -- I just beg to differ with that. I think that is a historical mistake. And for what it costs us to stay in Europe, it is a cheap endeavor.",
for,"Yeah. And you could write a book about it. And in fact, I just have. But let me just wrap it up, and I don't need 90 seconds. It's what they used to call a no-brainer. Putin's Russia represents absolutely no threat to the United States except those threats we ourselves have provoked, mainly through NATO expansion. Second, Putin himself, contrary to the newspapers, has not been mainly an aggressive leader -- you would think that's his middle name -- but a reactive leader, and that's where he's seen mainly in Russia's wealth. Third, Russia today, like it or not, is again a very great world power, certainly militarily and diplomatically. Herein lies the tragedy, and on this I'll stop. Putin's Russia, anyone's Russia, should be America's number one national security partner in the world. Washington squandered that opportunity after 1991, and it's continued to squander it today by inventing or provoking threats residing in Russia which do not exist.",
against,"I agree that the Russia threat is overblown, but not because the Russians pose no threat to us or desire to pose no threat to us. I think Russia is largely a threat to us through its weakness, rather than through its strength, and through its own choices, rather than through our choices. The Russian government under Vladimir Putin defines its security has having its neighbors be insecure: the invasion of Ukraine, the invasion of Crimea, the invasion of Georgia. They have frozen conflicts in Akazia, Nagona Carabagh -- the military exercises that they are holding, simulating nuclear weapons use in the Baltic States. What Russia as a state appears to want is other countries to fail, and that will make it feel safe. That's why I think Russia is a threat to us. Second, they're a threat to us because they are still a large nuclear weapons armed state, and the likelihood of miscalculation or war breaking out and escalating to nuclear use, I think we are not worried enough about that as a general problem in international relations. The question is whether or not they're a strategic threat to the United States, a military threat in Europe? And the answer there is almost certainly, ""No."" First of all, they don't have the capability to conquer any meaningful territory in Eastern Europe. The idea that this is the second coming of the Wehrmacht, or the second coming of the Soviet Union is a laughable argument. And not only do they not have the capability, they have no interest because they understand full well what happens when you try and conquer other countries. They occupied Eastern Europe for a long time, and they were just glad to get out of town. They don't want to go back in there. You say, ""What about Ukraine?"" I agree completely with Steve, and I've written about this. The Ukraine crisis is a result of our making. It's the result of NATO expansion. It's the result of the fact that we tried to make Ukraine part of the west, and the Russians found that intolerable, which is completely understandable, from their point of view. To the extent that they are a threat, it's because they have thousands of nuclear weapons, and that should scare the living bejesus out of all of us, but the fact that we're provoking them in Eastern Europe and in other places just makes it possible that those nuclear weapons will be used, and that's will be used, and that’s something we want to avoid at all costs.",
for,"No. I mean, I have a bit of a split decision on this one. First, I mean, I think the threat is easily manageable, particularly if we maintain NATO. I notice that a few individuals up here probably don’t want to maintain NATO, and they’re oddly the ones who believe that Russia isn’t a threat. I think if NATO goes down, then Russia’s problems loom large. I will just say this: I mean, if you have an individual, a dictator, who is sending military intelligence agents out into small cities in Great Britain and letting loose nerve agents, that’s a problem. If you have a Russian -- If you have a Russian dictator that is helping in the slaughter of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Syrians, that is a problem. Your time is up. Finally, to speak in an opening round on this resolution, The Russia Threat Is Overblown, Derek Chollet. Do you declare yes or no?",
for,"No, and that's because Vladimir Putin's Russia has a clear set of strategic goals; to divide the U.S. from Europe; to undermine NATO; to weaken the European Union; to project Russian power in the Middle East; to support liberal and nationalist politics; and to weaken the United States and our democratic partners around the world, undermining the very foundations of our democracies by spreading disinformation and fomenting dissent. Now, in some of these goals Russia is succeeding. On others, it’s not, but it would be strategic malpractice for us not to take this seriously and simply dismiss this threat as overblown. And although the U.S.-Russia relationship is not inevitably one of confrontation, and there have been recent examples where the two sides were able to come together and achieve common aims, we do need to be clear-eyed about the Russian threat. That said, I agree with some of my colleagues here. I do not believe that Russia is the greatest challenge to the United States in the 21st century. Russia is not 10 feet tall. Its economic and demographic woes are profound, and many of its actions around the world have boomeranged back against it. But Russia's weakness doesn't diminish the threat. In many ways, Russia's weakness makes the threat worse, causing Moscow to take greater risks and seek new nefarious ways that it can achieve its aims. So, we can't put our heads in the sand and dismiss Russia's intentions as benign. We need to take this threat seriously.",
against,"The fact is the United States foolishly pushed the Russians into the arms of the Chinese. The United States has a deep-seated interest in getting Russia to help the United States contain China in Asia. The Russians are perfectly willing to do that because China is a greater to them to the United -- than the United States is, because of geographic proximity. But because of our foolish policies, as a result of the Ukraine crisis, we've pushed the Russians into the arms of the Chinese. If these American policymakers today had been running foreign policy in the late 30s and early 40s, instead of allying with the Soviet Union to fight Nazi Germany, they would have had the Americans declare war against both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. That shows you what dunderheads they are.",
against,"I don't see a whole lot of evidence for that, to be honest, because we have tried very, very hard -- the United States government -- to bring Russia into cooperation, to include them in things -- the NATO-Russia Council -- to create opportunities. I mean, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin working together on all sorts of things. The problem is that that's actually not what the Russians want. What the Russians want is a confrontation with us that solidifies Putin's sense of domestic control and that makes Russia feel powerful in the world, when they cannot, by dint of a foreign policy that doesn't include the invasion of Ukraine or bombing hospitals in Syria -- to feel powerful. They don't want to be powerful on Western terms. They want to be powerful as an antagonist to us.",
for,"Well, it depends on how you formulate it. I mean, for historical and political reasons, it's not entirely due to bad American policy. Unique alliances are emerging in the world today. Russia-China-Iran. It's a new reality. To call that a dalliance is kind of to disregard decades of history. China's moment in the sun is coming. Russia has to decide where it's going to be in this order. The old order is falling apart; a new one is emerging, whether we like it or not. We don't dismiss it as a kind of capricious anti-American move on Russia. It's driven by powerful factors. Crimea is usually given as Putin's original sin, the invasion of Crimea. The advantage -- and I don't mean to be rude -- that I have over people who wave this Russian aggression flag is I've actually studied Putin for almost 20 years. And I don't think you can find the word Crimea in any of his talks, or interests, or foreign policy priorities until the United States abetted the overthrow of the legitimately elected -- whatever a it might have been -- president of Ukraine in February 2014. John wrote about this Foreign Affairs back in 2014, I think, John. And then Putin had to make a choice. Crimea is what it is, vital to Russia. It was part of Ukraine accidentally -- territory. Russia didn't care until what happened in Kiev.",
for,"So, there's a history to these provocations. A lot of the stuff that's been said here that Russia -- please, let's don't do John McCain's gas station. I mean, you know better than that. If you don't, Russia is either the seventh or eighth largest economy in the world today. The IMF and the World Bank think that Russia is really doing well -- they issued reports two days ago. Despite the American sanctions. We can't get to space without American rockets.",
for,"So, let's don't go to this nonsense about a gas station. This is –",
for,-- .,
for,"No. I don't find it persuasive. I mean, I do think there -- just on the issue of why dictatorships hang together. There is a reason why China, and Russia, and Iran have made an alliance. They run oppressive societies and they have the common denominator that they all really don't like the United States terribly much. So, the notion that somehow the Americans are going to anesthetize their democratic identity or their democratic mission is just preposterous. We're not going to do it. They know we're not going to do it. And what is striking to me is when I listen to Putin, I mean, I understand why the supreme leader of Iran likes him. He sounds like him. It's the same type of lexicon that they use to describe the common enemy. So, the -- I think it's just misplaced to talk about this realist potential of somehow we're going to build an alliance with the Russians. It's not going to happen because they don't want it to happen. If you were to actually have a thriving democratic society develop -- I know that seems like a million miles off -- in Ukraine, it could kill Putin. I mean, they have to squash it, grind it into the dust. They have to have a subservient society in Ukraine because, if they have an independent one, it's the most lethal dagger aimed at the political system that Putin has built up since the -- since he came into power.",
against,But does it also matter --,
against,-- what the Ukrainian's want?,
for,"Yeah, the -- I mean, that's -- what's striking to me is how it becomes America's fault that the people of Central and Eastern Europe want the United States closer to them and want to be protected from Russia. I don't understand how that becomes America's fault. When we would sit in meetings with counterparts from the Baltics or the Pols, they would talk about their great concerns about Russia and be thankful for everything the United States is doing, but then also go out of their way to remind us that the several thousand troops the U.S. may be rotating through the Baltics is just a small fraction of the Russian divisions that are lined up on their border. And after Ukraine, what they all thought is, ""This could be coming to a theater near us soon,"" because what Putin wants around his border are countries that essentially can exist under his thumb. And the Ukraine crisis did not start because of NATO. That -- NATO was not about that at all. The people were in the Maidan . Thousands of Ukrainians are in the Maidan because they wanted to be closer to Europe. They wanted to be closer to the European Union, and that went against Putin's objective, which was to create his own sort of rival institution closer to himself. The Ukrainian undemocratic president wanted to go that way. Unfortunately, the people of Ukraine wanted to go a different way.",
against,"Yeah, I just want to say that the United States has the Monroe Doctrine, and the Monroe Doctrine says that no distant great power, i.e. a great power from Europe or East Asia, is allowed to move military forces into the Western Hemisphere and form a military alliance with a country in our hemisphere. It makes eminently good sense for the United States. Russia, being a great power, has its own version of the Monroe Doctrine. The Russians recoil at the idea that NATO is going to march up to their border. They recoil at the idea that Ukraine and Georgia are going to be part of NATO. The Russians opposed NATO expansion vigorously from the mid-1990s forward because they viewed it much the way we think about the Monroe Doctrine, and it was our moving of NATO to the border, and saying that Ukraine and Georgia would become part of NATO, that led to the Georgia war in 2008 and led to the war over Ukraine in 2014.",
for,That's why thousands of Ukrainians are in the Maidan in Kiev in 2014.,
for,"Yeah, I just want to say, I mean, the -- I give the KGB some credit here, and their success of the SVR. I mean, for god's sakes, they penetrated the entire western security establishment. They are well aware that NATO has no offensive doctrine against Russia or the Soviet Union. They know it backwards and forwards. That's why they don't waste any time planning to have a defensive strategy with their units, because we -- they know we're not going anywhere. This pity the poor Russians, their scared of big bad America, it just makes no sense.",
against,"Well, I think -- I agree that we are more worried about the Russians and building them into a bigger threat than they actually are. But that is a natural reaction to Russia's bad behavior. There's a reason, as Derek said, that people are worried about Russia, because they -- making countries feel incredibly anxious.",
for,More than two.,
against,"Because, if they will do it in Britain, would they not do it here, given the -- what the Russians are doing, it looks to me, is that they know -- I agree with John that the Russians couldn't win a conventional war in Europe. The Polish military, the German military, the French military are strong enough to banded together with our help and defend themselves against Russia. What the Russians are doing is fighting a symmetric strategies, picking away at areas of unprotected western dominance. Social media; poisonings; the kinds of things that make them feel intimidating, and that's why there's this strong Russophobia building, because people rightly assess that Vladimir Putin's Russia is a malign actor in the world.",
for,"I'm a yes, but I am a “yes, but,” and I'll explain. Iran provides material and political support to those who are trying to destabilize the Middle East. Iran supports terrorists. Iran’s forces have been responsible for the deaths of thousands in places like Syria. Iran's proxies have killed American civilians and our troops. Iran represses its people at home while impoverishing them to achieve its aims abroad, and Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons. So, of course it's time to take a hard line against Iran. To me, the challenge is how best to do so. That begins by forging the strongest possible international consensus against Iran's behavior, not just among our partners in the Middle East but in Europe, Russia, and increasingly in Asia. Iran must know that its actions have consequences, whether in form of economic pressure, political isolation, or even military response. In other words, the best way to take a hard line is to present a united front, and that's what the Iran nuclear deal did. It was a smart, hardline policy in which the United States built leverage and brought the world together to bring unprecedented pressure on the Iranian regime to get concessions. The Iran nuclear deal did not solve all of our problems with Iran, but it did put the brakes on the most urgent and serious ones. So, taking a hard line needs to be more than a slogan. It needs to be a means to an end. It's not just about talking tough and beating your chest; it's about pursuing smart policies that get you closer to your goals.",
for,"That’s a no. You know, Derek, I mean, I kind of give him the credit that he's made at least a semi-persuasive case. I mean, I don't think it's off the charts like some of the things that have been said about Russia.",
for,I'll take it. I'll take it!,
for,"No, you should. But my feeling is that the United States -- or Trump, as we like to call the United States today -- having left the nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions, I ask myself what would a harder line result in? And I think it would result in results that we wouldn’t like, and that's why I think no. These results -- it's likely to create instability inside Iran because there's political conflict there. That is likely to spread to Iraq and Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, and I don't see that is good for anybody. Secondly, it certainly would, at least theoretically, risk war, depending on how hard this hard line is. And that could involve the United States, Israel, and possibly Russia. Thirdly, given their financial profitable urges, it's probably going to continue to alienate our European allies, who are vested economically -- rather than ideologically -- in Iraq. It will then increase -- and you may think this is a good or bad thing -- Russia's military and energy producing role in the world, because --",
against,"It is time to take a harder line on Iran. They are the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world. They are destabilizing neighboring governments. They're arming Hezbollah and Hamas. They are keeping Bashar Al-Assad in power and doing a lot of the murderous work of that horrible war. And they are occasionally interdicting shipping in the Straits of Hormuz, through which an enormous amount of the world's oil transits. So, yes. We should take a harder line. I agree with both Stephen and Derek that withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear agreement made that harder because it makes it harder for us to get the support of countries that we need to take a harder line. The basic problem in American policy for the last two administrations toward Iran has been that both the Trump administration and the Obama administration had an unbelievable policy. Namely, ""Either you stop your nuclear weapons program, or we will destroy it."" And I don't think that's credible out of either of the two governments. We need a wider range of tools to manage the Iran problem. At its core, the Iran problem is that the domestic legitimacy and the foreign policy of Iran have the same root, which is they view themselves as a revolutionary power. So, taking a soft line on Iran doesn't result on Iran stopping doing these things.",
against,"I say no. I take this resolution as a question dealing with President Trump's decision in May of this year to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran. And I think that that was a fundamental mistake. Look, the question is, if you have a country – -- you have a country like Iran that is thinking about getting nuclear weapons, what's the best way to prevent that from happening? And there are basically two ways you can do it or at least think about doing it. One is you can threaten that country. Or two, you can try to cooperate with it as much as possible -- work out some sort of rapprochement -- and remove the incentive for that country to get nuclear weapons. The question you want to ask yourselves is ""Why do countries want nuclear weapons?"" They want nuclear weapons because they understand they are the ultimate deterrent. And if you are threatened, you really want to have nuclear weapons. Why does Israel have nuclear weapons? Because its leaders think they live in a dangerous neighborhood where they want to have the ultimate deterrent in their back pocket. Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. So, there's going to be a very powerful incentive for the Iranians to think the same way. Now, the hawks believe that you can get really tough with the Iranians, and you can beat them into giving up nuclear weapons forever. I don't think that's going to happen. First of all, it's just going to reinforce the hardliners inside Iran. And second of all, nationalism is a very powerful force. And the idea that you could push the Iranians around -- I think -- is a misguided thought.",
against,"Yes, I think there are dangerous unintended consequences for confronting Iran's destabilizing and dangerous behavior, but there are also dangerous unintended consequences of not confronting it. It's not -- it's not a 90/10 decision that you're making, allowing Iran to continue to destabilize regional governments, to interdict the free commerce through the straights of , to be -- to continue to be a state sponsor of terror. Recall that the Iranian government tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C. So not confronting those things –",

for,"Well, look. This is the land of no good options, right? When I was at the Pentagon during the negotiations of the Iran Nuclear Deal, I had nothing to do with the negotiations. What the Pentagon's role in this was, ""What do we do when the negotiations or if the negotiations fail?"" and all we're left with is the military option. Now, we have options. The United States military has shown over the years that it can do all sorts of things: overthrow governments, put a lot of firepower on particular targets, but those are not particularly palatable options. So, when we look at the Iran Nuclear Program as a challenge, we have to think, ""All right, how do we try to solve this problem?"" We have a series of tools we could use. We have military tools. We have diplomatic tools. We have economic tools. How do we try to change their behavior? So, I would argue we were in a better position where we had isolated the nuclear problem -- Reuel's right, temporarily, 10-15 years -- so we could work on the other aspects of Iran's behavior that pose such a threat to the United States. The problem now, that we pulled out of the nuclear deal -- when you go to Europe, when you go out to the Middle East, what they're talking about is American policy, not Iran's policy. And I don't believe that Iran has actually benefited that much from the nuclear deal. I mean, the Iranian people were on the streets, and they actually thought the nuclear deal was a bad deal for them. So, the idea that now we're going to engage in some sort of negotiation to get a better deal from our perspective, a worse deal for Iran, to me, is fantasy.",
against,"Yeah, I want to respond to a point that Kori made and tie that into a point that Reuel made. You're critical of the Iranians for destabilizing regimes in the region. Is there any country that’s destabilized more regimes than the United States of America? I mean, the hypocrisy here is really, with all due respect, stunning. We make a business of destabilizing regimes. And this brings us to the matter of Syria. I’m sorry, it was not the Russians and the Iranians who started that humanitarian disaster. It was, in good part, the United States, the Turks, the Qataris, and the Saudis who funded and trained the insurgents and tried to bring down Assad and failed and created a humanitarian disaster of the first order. The United States has blood all over its hands in Syria. And it was the Russians and the Iranians who came in later who were trying to put Assad back in power, and as distasteful as that outcome is, it’s the only possible way we’re going to stop the bloodshed in Syria.",

I mean, people tend to now somehow scorn the Arab Spring. I prefer to call it the great Arab revolt. But you tend to forget that they were trying to overthrow just hideous regimes, and that hideous regime decided that the only way they could control the situation -- because they represented the , which are less than 10 percent of the population -- was just start slaughtering the Sunnis. And of course, we stood by and watched it, and I don’t think that was the high watermark of the Obama administration. So -- and the Iranians are out there; they’re out to recast the Middle East, and what they know and a lot of people tend to forget is that the classical Middle East -- that is, from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan -- it’s basically a 50-50 split between Shiites and Sunnis. And so, the Iranians have learned that they can adopt a very aggressive sectarian approach and that they can get a lot of traction.",

Not only Reuel, but many Americans feel that they know which are hideous regimes, and which aren’t, and hideous regimes are the ones we don’t support, and the others are hideous. This thing with Syria to me has always been both bafflement and involved a key question, because we have an empirical moment when a decision was made by President Obama. In 2015, President Putin of Russia said to Obama, “We need to form an alliance in Syria against the Islamic State,” and Obama was much inclined to do so. And in fact, my reading is he did agree, and then he walked away from it, and Putin then intervened on his own, I think in September. But what Putin said to Obama -- and you know, you could run down Putin all you want, but first you need to read him. He doesn’t talk about the United States the way Khomeini does. You just haven’t read Putin; you’re just making that up. I mean, it seems right to you, but it’s not true. Here’s the point. What Putin said to Obama, and Obama thought about it and decided against, is we have a choice; 2015. It’s either going to be the Islamic State in Damascus -- and remember, the Islamic State then was whack, whack, whack, whack -- or it’s going to be Assad. There’s no alternative. Give me an alternative. So, either we keep Assad in Damascus, or we let the Islamic State take it. Obama decided ; Israel agreed with Putin.",

But it's not because of purposeful behavior on their part -- the kind of story you're hearing from the people who disagree with me up here. It's largely as a result of the foolish policies of the United States. Just take Iraq, for example. You know they fought a war, along war -- eight years -- in the 1980s with Iraq. And now they have tremendous influence in Iraq. Why? Because the United States toppled Saddam Hussein and left Iraq wide open for them. They make the same argument with regard to Syria.",

We have a new Cold War that’s fraught with new Cuban missile-type crises. What we learned from President Kennedy in 1962 is that to avoid nuclear war in such a crisis we have to trust our president fully. Trump can’t have a phone call with Putin today without John Brennan, the former director of the CIA, yelling that it’s treason and three New York Times columnist echoing. So, if there’s a new Cuban missile crisis type situation -- we almost had one last week in Syria; maybe it’s going to be that, or in Ukraine, or -- I mean, add it up; in the north Baltics, where NATO is building up. And suddenly, we’re at this moment, and we have to trust Trump as we have every president since Eisenhower to avoid a nuclear war with Moscow. He can’t do it. This Russia-gate thing, which I do not believe, by the way, has crippled him. And I’m afraid that if the Democrats take the House that they will go all out on this impeachment, and if there’s a Cuban type of crisis, we will be in such grave danger, not because of Trump, but because he won’t be free to do what every president since Eisenhower has done.",

It is the only way that you are going to keep the peace. You are sometimes going to get involved in wars that may be distasteful, frustrating, and all the rest. That is part of the process.
