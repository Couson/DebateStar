for,"I suspect he's forgotten about that one comment, but you know, if you ask me, is an incumbent going to come in again on balance, I think that's a good bet. Well, I guess, if I were going to title my book on the environment now, I probably would title it, ""The River Runs Black."" I might title it, ""The River Doesn't Run Anymore,"" because China has lost more than half of its 50,000 odd rivers over the past few decades. But I will say that I think, for the first time maybe, the Chinese leadership has the understanding and the capacity and the will to make a difference. So I am, for the first time in all those decades, pretty optimistic.",nan
against,"Well, a cool war is when you have a geopolitical struggle as does exist between the U.S. and China, but at the same time, you have deep cooperation and mutual dependence on the economic front. So when you've got both of those things happening at the same time, you need to be somewhere in the middle between hot and cold, and I settled on cool. Yeah, it's a bit like frenemies or imagine a relationship you just can't get out of. Not too much. As you just mentioned, she teaches Chinese five days a week. I use it in my research and when I meet my Chinese colleagues. So by the time we come home, I think that's the last language we really want to speak. But I must say that, when we did use it, it's when we didn't want our two boys to understand us. And then the younger son started studying Chinese, and now he understands us.",nan
for,"I'm a no. I think China's making China great again. I think that's very clear, certainly in terms of the relative stability that we have under Xi Jinping, the comparative happiness of the average Chinese in support for their government, which I think is higher than the average American for the American government these days. But Trump himself is not making China great again. The Chinese really want stability. And there's no question it's true that, because the Americans are leaving the Transpacific Partnership and the Americans are leaving the Paris Climate Accord, that creates some space for China, but China would much rather have stability and also have more time to keep their head low, just keep building, focus on stability, spend the money with one belt, one road, all the rest. With the concerns around North Korea, with all the allies wondering what's going to happen in their future, they're thinking about alternatives, hence Japan and India increasingly together, hence concerns that the North Koreans are going to blow things up, driving South Korea into focusing on more security, Japan, too. None of that is good for China. I am also a no, but for very different reasons. I think that this is a popular notion that is fundamentally flawed. President Trump may be crippling U.S. prestige an influence globally, maybe diminishing U.S. greatness, but this doesn't make China great. Greatness is not a zero-sum game. There's not a definable quality or quantity of greatness that can shift from one country to another. It’s not like U.S. greatness goes down and Chinese greatness goes up. Greatness has to be earned. As Winston Churchill said, the price of greatness is responsibility. And that means that China needs to be able to look beyond its narrow self-interest to embrace and address the needs of others. It needs to be ready to step up to the plate, to forge an international agreement when you’re faced with a global threat or a global challenge. Thus far we haven’t seen China do much of this. So President Trump can’t make China great again. Only China can make it great again. And thus far China hasn’t done that.",nan
against,"I declare yes. When you walk away from global leadership in a very open and public way, i.e., you tell people I’m not interested in leading you, I want to make my own country great again, you create a huge vacuum, and there’s pressure on somebody else to step into that vacuum, especially if like China that entity would benefit from stability. So that means there’s a stability gap. China is obligated, whether they would like to or not, to step into that gap. And we see that with the way that Xi Jinping has been taking global leadership on a range of issues, or at least presenting himself as taking global leadership. Second, and even more concretely, when it comes to our historic allies in Asia, in the Pacific who rely on us for security, our current president has, unfortunately, sent a message to them that our guarantees of security are not as strong as they have been in the past. And they hear that loud and clear, and they, too, are obligated to react to that. And so they have to look, inevitably, at closer relations with China -- perhaps economically -- in order to try to assure their stability that way. So a gap will be a filled. I’m also a no. Trump could help for the reasons that Noah just indicated. I agree with him there. But it’s up to China to make itself great again, as Ian said. This is a long-term project for the Chinese, a 200-year project, really, or since the 1870s is when they began their effort to rejuvenate themselves after a couple hundred bad years. They’re called the centuries of shame and humiliation. But greatness, I would just note, is measured not just by capabilities but by attraction and whether others seek to emulate you. This is Joseph Nye’s concept of soft power, of course. So I would like at China and ask, is China a model for others? And I find that it is not a model for others. It is a sui generis country, very much out for itself. The question is, if you’re going to be a great power, you have to be magnanimous, amongst other things. And it’s an open question whether China can be magnanimous. Yeah, I mean, sometimes Shakespeare put it best. This is one of those examples: Some are born great, some achieve greatness, some have greatness thrust upon them. It’s not true that global greatness is totally an internal product. It involves, unquestionably, internal action. You need to be stable. You need to at least appear to be magnanimous. You need to not pretend not to be. But under circumstances where the world is looking for stability, where the region as well is looking for stability, there will be an impulse from outside to demand some forms of leadership. And China may find itself with little choice but to adopt a position that we associate with greatness with a great power simply because of our self-conscious attempt to absent ourselves from that space. So I’m not disagreeing that a country, to be great, must do things on its own, but I’m making the point that greatness is not only what you do. It’s also what happens around you.",nan
for,"It’s too early to have greatness thrust upon China. America remains the world’s only super power. China is not close. Economically, certainly they have cash and they’re spending it, and they can direct it. But in terms of the diplomatic capabilities, you watch them in the G-20 when they're kind of sitting by themselves, and everyone else knows each other -- they're not even close. You talk about their military capabilities -- they're just a regional power. You talk about the technological capabilities, they're investing. They will get there over the long-term, I believe, but they are not there yet. Anyone that saw Xi Jinping giving the big keynote at Davos this last year, where he was the one saying, ""We support free trade and globalization,"" the people in the audience were, like, ""Well, that's new."" But it doesn't in any way reflect the China we know, that doesn't have rule of law, that doesn't actually have an independent judiciary, and it doesn't actually practice what they preach. So, this is a very serious problem, and I would argue that, yes, Shakespeare is correct -- if you're actually the man with the plan and just waiting, and there it is. This is far too early for China to have great expectations.",nan
against,"Well, I don't disagree that it's too soon, as Ian says. But sometimes, a country is not completely prepared for the stance that it's nevertheless obligated to take on. Arguably, World War I was too soon for the United States to have to get involved in Europe to try to resolve the war towards its end. But there was little choice but to do so. And so, I think, you know, great powers say this can be achieved slowly, and it can be achieved step by step. Was the United States a great power after World War I? I mean, in some sense, we as Americans imagine that the answer must be yes. But globally, arguably, that wasn't yet true. Maybe we -- they were a regional power. Our economy was not well developed. Were a world leader with respect to humanitarianism at the time? No. Were we anywhere close to Britain? No. But we were on a trajectory that led us into a position of greatness -- again, not entirely of our own choosing, although partly of our own choosing. And so, to Liz's point, I agree that it will be issue-by-issue. I agree that China will not follow our playbook for what a great country is. They will follow their own playbook for what that is. And they will do it on a slower, and I think more openly self-interested basis. Well, vacuums can perhaps offer opportunities for them to be filled. ""Nature abhors vacuums,"" I think it's said. China is filling the vacuum in Southeast Asia. But again, I come back to my point about greatness. Greatness, to me, has to do with influence. It's not just based on a country's capabilities. And Ian has already indicated where China is a what I used to call a partial power in one of my books. It's not there yet except in the economic side. It's a work-in-progress and it's going to be some time before they reach that. But my real point is, are others gravitating towards China because they wish to emulate China or they simply wish to benefit from China's economic largess? Okay, that's different. Nobody seems to be queuing up to model their political systems on China's political systems. As Liz just said, diplomatically, the Chinese are not in the middle of any crisis voluntarily. They're thrust into it as we see with North Korea right now. But if you're a great power, you get in the middle of difficult situations, you forge coalitions, you bring others together, you lead. China puts its head in the sand and hides whenever there's a crisis.",nan
for,"Well, yeah, I mean, I think that Noah's point, that greatness is being thrust upon China and Southeast Asia, to the extent that it's happening anywhere, it probably is happening there. But in Japan, which is, you know, arguably strategically more important than Southeast Asia, actually Abe's first trip after Trump was elected, he was the first guy to come in and see him even before he was president. And this was because Abe was concerned that if the Americans were slipping, they needed to double down and make sure that they had a strong security relationship with the U.S., even after the Americans pulled out of CPB. I think that, despite all the problems between Trump and South Korea, the North Korean conflict has driven South Korea much more towards the United States than Trump has driven South Korea towards Beijing, and that's going to be a problem for South Korea economically but also for the Chinese. I see Germany now worried that the United States isn't doing as much coordination on global trade between the Americans and the Europeans. So, the Germans are now trying to lead, along with other Europeans, a CFIUS style policy that will actually make it harder for the Chinese to invest in Europe. Again, on all of these points, I would say that in 10 years' time, China might be capable of breaking through this and forcing countries towards them. I think now it's more likely to hurt them. Final point here, this meeting between Abe and Modi, the Indians have not wanted to play geopolitics at all, but now they see that China, because of the vacuum, is playing a bigger role in the region, and certainly in Southeast Asia. Now the Indians are saying, ""We need to spend money, coordinate with the Japanese,"" and we need to show that China's not the only ballgame. All of that stuff is ultimately causing a bunch of bumps in the road that the Chinese really are in no stage in their development to handle right now. Yeah, I would just say it's probably not fair to say that China's having greatness thrust upon it. The truth is that Xi Jinping walked in the door and said, ""I am committed to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" right? And he has done everything but step up and say, as Ian said in Davos, right? We are a leader in globalization, you know, stood by Angela Merkel and said, you know, ""We are the leader on climate change,"" without actually backing that up with significant action. So, I think the -- he's put himself out there as a leader, but he hasn't actually led. Well, he's just lucky that Trump's leaving the stage to him, then. But he's not leaving the stage to him because he's not prepared to do anything. I declare, ""Yes, game on."" I think trade is a competitive game and, frankly, we should play hardball with every country. We want U.S. companies to win. But we also understand that, as long as the field is basically open and fair, that everybody's generally playing by the same rules that U.S. companies are sometimes, perhaps even often, going to lose. The problem with China is that it's constructed its own set of rules and its own game. And in this game, there is rampant intellectual property theft from U.S. companies. China forces technology transfer from U.S. companies as a price of doing business in China. It massively distorts trade through subsidies and it restricts or blocks U.S. companies and others from investing in core sectors of the Chinese economy. And China joined the WTO in 2001. It's been more than 15 years that the United States and the rest of the world has waited for China to learn the rules of the game. But if China's not going to play fair, then we have to play hardball.",nan
against,"I declare no. The time to play hardball -- and of course, there are times for that -- it requires two conditions. One, you have to be very confident that you know what you’re doing and that the people in charge on your side know what they’re doing. Because if you go too far, you could escalate to difficult circumstances. The second requirement is you have to have leverage. I don’t think we qualify under either of these circumstances at present with respect to China. I don’t frankly trust the Trump administration to escalate tensions with China over questions of trade. Trump knows that will play well to his base. His instincts are towards protectionism. In the long run, in my view, a closer trade relationship with China is a valuable thing for the United States for reasons that I’ll get to in just a moment. And risking that, I think is real under the conditions of Trump’s presidency. Second, we need leverage. And there, of course we have leverage at the trade level, at the economic level, but we have less leverage with respect to geopolitics. Right now the U.S. really needs China’s help on a wide range of security issues, North Korea most significantly amongst them. And I really think that’s a substantial lack of leverage. I am also a no for some of the reasons that Noah just indicated, mainly the one about escalation. That would result in what’s known as mutual assured destruction in the Cold War, in nuclear terms. This would result in mutual assured economic destruction. We are so interdependent economically, and we depend on and need various Chinese goods in our country, and they to a lesser extent ours in their country. So -- and we believe in open borders and open trade. At least we did until the Trump administration. Where I would play hardball, though, is on investment. It may be a fine distinction, so I’m not -- I don’t think we should play hardball on trade because of the escalation, but for reasons Liz has indicated, China’s market is closed -- relatively -- overwhelmingly, I’ll say, closed to American investors. Here we are 30 years on, and if you look at the American Chamber of Commerce quarterly surveys in Beijing, 81 percent of American companies say they feel unwelcome in China.",nan
for,"Yes. This is the one that’s toughest for me of the four. I’m kind of on the fence, but if you make me I’ll say yes. One reason is because on North Korea, the Chinese were not going to move until the Americans really pushed. Yes, even Trump with the potential of being a little unhinged, it got them to much harder sanctions than they otherwise would have supported. The U.S. economy is much bigger than China’s economy today. That will not be true in five or 10 years’ time. There is more leverage in that. If there were a trade war, we would win it, though both would take damage. That would be much more challenging in five or 10 years’ time. Finally, Bannon, Gorka, others are gone. So the people that are most likely to do something that would truly cause conformation aren’t making the decisions. Trump may say stuff, but people like Lighthizer, frankly, Wilbur Ross, Mattis, others that are managing the China relationship are adults, and so ultimately, I do think we’re going to have to be a little tougher on the Chinese.",nan
against,"Fortunately, I think it’s not yet the case. I think, though, that notwithstanding the presence of the grownups that Ian mentioned, there is still one other person he didn’t mention, and that is the person who’s going to make the decision ultimately. And, you know, I think that it’s entirely possible that the view that Steve Bannon expressed there is still believed in some form by relevant decision-makers in the White House, primarily the president. So, you know, that’s a description of where we could end up. That’s Bannon playing the political game of describing something as the case, In hopes of making it the case.",nan
for,"Yeah. I mean, I think that's what we've argued for 15 years -- that we should be a model for China, and that they will learn from us and gradually we're going to see the Chinese economy evolve into one that looks like ours. But that's not what's happened, right? You look back to, you know, 2012, Chinese -- six Chinese solar companies dominated the global market. Why? Because they had huge subsidies from the Chinese government. If they didn't have those companies -- those subsidies, they would have been bankrupt, right? They completely flooded our markets with their products. You know, we do have leverage. I mean, U.S. exports to China equal about two-thirds of 1 percent of our GDP. In contrast, Chinese exports to the U.S. equal about 4 percent of their GDP. You know, we have a lot of leverage with China right now. We can do things, and we should do things. Well, I don't know why we have temporary leverage. I do think, to the other point that you were making, about the attack on the United States, in terms of, you know, our technology and our future, that it is a significant issue already, and it will only grow. I mean, they've made huge inroads into our semiconductor industry. They're pouring $100 billion to go in and acquire firms from the U.S. -- and I think, as Ian mentioned, from Germany. There's an enormous amount of concern in Europe as well. So, I think that it's not just about the U.S.; it's about a lot of countries standing up and saying, ""This is how we do business. And China, you're too big at this point"" -- the second or the first largest economy in the world, depending on how you evaluate it. ""You have to play by the rules that everybody else is playing by, or you're going to suffer the consequences."" And I think reciprocity, right, saying, ""Our market -- your market is closed in these areas. Well, maybe we're not going to let you invest either"" is the way to go.",nan
against,"Well, just to finish my point about reciprocity on investment, there is where we have leverage. And Liz just made the point -- or maybe it was you, John -- that China is trying to become an innovative power, to, you know, add value and get out of the middle income trap and become a fully developed economy. Well, what it's trying to do is acquire certain niche technologies in some very specifically designated fields, both in Europe and here in the United States. We can vet that and we can prevent that, and we need to strengthen our U.S. government -- it's called the CFUIS Process, I think it was raised -- not just over national security concerns, but over technology and our comparative advantages. And we can leverage that against China for access for -- for American companies in China.",nan
for,"And here, I just -- I really quite disagree. I don't believe the Americans are going cap-in-hand on geopolitical cooperation. The United States has vastly more geopolitical power and influence than the Chinese do. As I already mentioned, it's driving the Japanese and the South Koreans to work much more closely, and the Chinese are deeply unhappy about it. Look, the fact is that America's North Korea policy is perhaps one of the best emblematic policies of America First. It's certainly not South Korea First. It's certainly not Japan First. It's kind of a ""Hey, we're going to make this a problem before it comes to the American shores."" In other words, North Korea is far away. And if there's anything that really blows up there, China's going to have to deal with it much more than the United States. We actually have more leverage. Another point that's gotten more controversial is -- to what extent, as Bush would say, is Trump actually the decider? I mean, he's the queen, right, in the sense that -- -- we must show deference and put him on television and have him -- all of that. But in terms -- he's wanted -- he's been saying, ""I want tariffs, where are my tariffs?"" They're not giving him tariffs. It's insubordination, right? I mean, in -- on many of these cases, it does seem, on national security issues and big international trade issues, that Trump does seem to recognize that actually the generals know a lot more than him -- even though he says a lot of stuff, that actually implementation of policy is a bit more mature than the headlines in the mainstream media might lead us to believe. So I'm a little less worried about that. I'll let Ian get his applause, but I think it's a mistake to look at this issue linkage all the time. I think you end up in a very slippery slope. There will always be something that can Trump something else. I think China has its own reasons for wanting to make progress on the North Korea issue increasingly. I know we're going to have a discussion about North Korea and I don't want to go too far down that path, but the Chinese leadership is under enormous pressure domestically to take a tougher line. So I think we shouldn't be so concerned about the North Korea going to China about North Korea cap-in-hand. We're not doing that. China has its own reasons for taking action. I don't think we should be linking the two issues. We should be pushing back on the trade issue and pushing back hard.",nan
against,"I would vet every merger and acquisition attempt by a Chinese company towards and to American technology companies. That is hardball. I would look very toughly at any investments by China in our energy sector, near national security locations around the country, and I would just sort of hold back the approval process, you know, the way the Chinese do with us all the time. They just keep you hanging and you never get your approval unless you're President or Ivanka Trump, and then you get 60 patents overnight. So, you know, we just have to play the game the way they play -- they've been playing it with us. That doesn't mean -- so here we have an internal disagreement because you're taking -- you are arguing for hardball but only on investment, not on trade. But I want to, you know, just respond to that by saying, you know, ""That is not in fact how investment in the United States has historically worked and has meant to work."" And that's not because we're so open-minded and we're trying to improve the wealth of people over the world. It's that we’ve actually believed that it is in our national interest to attract capital from abroad, right? That has always been one of our goals and it remains one of our goals. It's one of the commitments to free trade. So I agree that you can situationally deploy something like that to try to get something in return. I don't dispute that. So-called greenfield investment is fine. Let them build factories. China employs 94,000 Americans right now, according to the Rhodium Group. That's great, or maybe it's up to 120. That sort of investment is not what I'm talking about. It's the targeted technology acquisition to fulfill their maiden China 2025 program. That's where we and the Germans and the British and the Japanese, the global leaders -- they're after us and we've got to be awake, first of all, and put up barriers to prevent that acquisition.",nan
for,"Look, I do agree with Xi Jinping, that everyone is a loser in a trade war because, ultimately, there is a mutually assured economic destruction between the two countries. But I don't think playing hardball with the Chinese on trade leads you to a trade war. And, in that regard, it's not mutually assured economic destruction. With nukes, mutually assured destruction, you hit someone with a nuke, it's really hard to imagine that doesn't continue to escalate. On trade, we hit the Chinese with a tariff, they hit us back usually with a tariff that is calculated very clearly to cause exactly the same amount of economic damage, but with a bunch of stuff that doesn't bother them as much. I think they have to see that we're serious, especially because, as Liz said, multinational corporations based in the U.S. that are worth the most, the IT firms -- look at China today and say, ""They don't think they have a future. Facebook can't get in."" Even though Mark Zuckerberg learned Chinese, said that he would give a symbolic Chinese name to his child and Xi Jinping said, ""That's nice. I'm not letting you in."" Google, same problem. Apple's fine for now, but down the road I think experiencing it. These companies will not coordinate because they're competitors with each other. It's not like China. The United States government is going to have to actually provide a little bit of strategic engagement here.",nan
against,"I’m going to say no. I don’t think that, in the end, there’s a picture of Chinese national interests in which steps would be taken that would put North Korea in a situation where it was actually vulnerable to regime collapse. Now, containment is a -- it’s a tricky word. And so if the resolution were to be interpreted to say, well, to hold North Korea back from using nuclear weapons I would be inclined to say yes. But containment suggests something other than that. Containment suggests non-expansion. And I think for the moment, the risk to China of South Korea and North Korea potentially unifying in a way that leaves a hostile power on its border is so great that China will have to keep North Korea in place. And to keep North Korea in place at this point seems to require accepting its nuclear program at least as strongly as it presently is. So I don’t see a containment strategy in that sense. I’m tempted to leave my marker like that because I’m ambivalent to answer. I was going to be a no, but I’m actually going to change my vote and be a little provocative and vote yes. The problem -- This is -- we all know this is a real conundrum. There are no good resolutions or solutions, or they would have been used and discovered already on North Korea. But what we haven’t talked about with the Chinese, as far as I know, is a post-unification scenario. If we can persuade the Chinese about a unified Korean Peninsula with essentially a South Korea regime that does not have American forces on it and does not necessarily have an American alliance with it, that would alleviate their neuralgic national security concerns considerably. They can’t stand the North Korea regime. They’ve had problems with the North Korean regime since June 1950, when the North attacked the South and they didn’t know. It’s been 50 years of hell for the Chinese with North Korea. They don’t like the regime. So we have to bring them somehow to a regime transition perspective together.",nan
for,"So, Yes. In the immortal words of Bob the Builder, can we fix it? Yes, we can. So I think China and the U.S. are closer to being able to forge an agreement on North Korea than at any time in the past decade. In part, I think it’s because Kim Jong Un has changed the facts on the ground, now can launch a missile strike, and perhaps a nuclear warhead in the near future that can hit the United States. And that’s changed the calculus here, and the Chinese understand that. In part, it’s because we have a new president for whom conventional wisdom and historical knowledge do not pose any restrictions and also, he wants all options on the table and wants an agreement, wants to make a deal. And in part, it’s because, as I mentioned earlier, the Chinese leadership itself is under enormous pressure. Its foreign policy elite wants the government to take a tougher line. The Chinese public are concerned about things like nuclear -- radioactive fallout. And it's -- and there's a fear that President Trump might go rogue and leave China to pick up the pieces. So, what an agreement might look like is a different issue -- -- but can we fix it? Yes, we can.",nan
against,"To me, the implication is that China was willing to do the initial round of sanctions, just thus far, and no further. They're not willing to undertake steps that might actually put sufficient pressure on North Korea to make the regime tauter. And that's, I think, a very significant moment for them. It's their way of saying that, ""Yes, we're annoyed with the North Koreans"" -- maybe more than annoyed. ""Yes, we're worried. Yes, we don't want regional destabilization. But we actually aren't prepared to do anything about it because fixing the problem would require steps that contradict our national interest."" And you know, we have allies like that too -- not to put too fine a point on it -- where we might want them to do things that we would be able to -- you'd think, given our level of support and commitment -- require them or obligate them to do. And sometimes those allies say to us, ""No."" You know, what's your point of leverage again? And I think this is exactly what's happening to the Chinese and North Korea. Hm -- Well, the problem is the North Koreans won't go peacefully into the night, you know? So, even if the Americans and the Chinese could come -- and the South Koreans, and Japan, and the other actors could come to an agreement about regime transition, the North Koreans aren't going to go along with it. So, that brings us back to square one -- or Intelligence Squared -- with containment and sanctions and -- So -- But I'm just trying to put on the table that we haven't at least had the conversation with the Chinese whereby there could be a post-unification Korea that was not threatening to China. That's what they worry about. They don't want regime collapse -- A, because of the humanitarian dimension, B, the economic dimension -- having picked up the pieces. It costs 12 times, apparently, the amount of money to rebuild the north as it did West Germany to absorb the former East Germany. And they don't, you know, obviously want a Communist state on their periphery -- one of the four remaining Communist states on the planet -- to go down. But if there are ways to sort of figure out some broader transition and a coalition government, or a phase transition between North and South -- we haven't had these conversations.",nan
for,"Yeah. David is absolutely right. And it's interesting that a noted Chinese scholar -- who is a friend of both of ours -- has just published an article talking about the need for China to have this kind of contingency planning take place, Chiang Ching. So, it's an example of how -- yes, the Chinese went so far and not that far with this set of negotiations. But this far is further than they went in the last round of sanctions. So, you see the Chinese progressing over time, in terms of the severity of the sanctions that they're willing to implement on North Korea. Let's not forget that in five years of Xi Jinping's presidency, he has not met once with Kim Jong Un. There is no love lost between this Chinese leader and Kim Jong Un. And while it's true that, you know -- it's not clear that Kim Jong Un will go peacefully into the night, there are other options, right? There's the decapitation option -- and I'm not suggesting that China's there yet. But you know, it took a long time – Decapitation?",nan
against,She meant it literally.,nan
for,I was -- it kind of – hoping not to,nan
against,It's not an euphemism at all.,nan
for,"-- was. It kind of was. Thank you. Yeah. So, it would mean the elimination of Kim Jong Un -- or perhaps we just send him to Switzerland with a billion dollars, and that would be a better way to go. But I do think that the Chinese are increasingly open to tougher actions against North Korea for their own reasons. I think the Rodman plan is as likely to work -- -- as what we just heard. Wait a minute. What? Ping-pong diplomacy goes to basketball diplomacy. Don't laugh. Yeah, look -- It's real. If you want to go there, feel free. I don't think that's your yes vote. But my no vote is the fact that the North Koreans understand that Qaddafi didn't have nukes. Dead. Hussein, no nukes. Dead. Kim Jong Un, not dead. And -- -- you know, I look at what's in front of them. I see a guy that wants to develop an ICBM with reentry capabilities. Wants to develop a miniaturized set of nuclear warheads, wants to be in a position where, truly, the decapitation option is truly not on the table, and then we can do the deal, and that's after containment. In other words, that's containing from a bigger place. America has history with that. We told the Indians and Pakistanis, ""No nukes. You do nukes, we're going to have a problem with you."" They do the nukes, they do the tests, we sanction them. We put serious sanctions. After, you know, 10 plus years, we pull the sanctions back. Why, because they behaved? No, because they didn't. They broke through the containment. We're like, ""Well, shit, we lost on that one, so I guess we got to deal with you guys now."" No. So this is after-hours HBO-like stuff, right? So my point is that there is absolutely -- I can see into the future. Once the North Koreans develop a nuclear program that they consider is sufficiently robust to avoid the decapitation, we could absolutely with the Chinese get to a deal. We are not there yet.",nan
against,"War is not an option. Some sort of discussions need to take place directly with the north, multi-partied discussions. And, again, I come back to the sort of unification dimension of all this. It's the one thing all parties agree on. North wants to unify. South wants to unify. Americans are not opposed to it. The Chinese are not opposed to it. I think we need to kind of think beyond nukes, first of all. That's the American obsession, and for good reason. That's not the Chinese obsession. So there is a different set -- there are kind of apples and oranges, and two ships sort of passing in the night, and they're not really talking beyond the immediate. I just wanted to point out directly in response to David's really important point, that there's a structural problem with a demilitarized unified Korea that the U.S. wouldn't be defending, and that is China, right? So, whatever this entity would be, for South Korea to agree to enter it, no matter how idealistic they might be feeling that day, they're going to be aware that their entity will not be bordering China directly and they will need a security guarantor and that's only us. You know, there isn't another credible -- and, you know, no degree of self-protection is going to suffice against China. So, to me, there's a structural problem with even beginning to imagine what a, I think you said, quasi-demilitarized unified Korea would look like. You're assuming that South Korea would not want to live in a Chinese sphere of influence. No, I think they would fully accept living in a Chinese sphere of influence. I think they would. I think they're already in a Chinese sphere of influence in economic terms. I think what they have wanted thus far, and to my mind, this is the current conundrum of the Pacific, generally, countries are living under the Chinese economic sphere of influence while depending on the U.S. as a security guarantor. They're playing both ends against the middle and that has worked for those countries.",nan
for,"Well, first of all, I'm not sure there is a bargain that Kim Jong Un is willing to comply with, but I do think that we have to -- Right, that's back to decapitation, but I do think, you know, we --",nan
against,So that's a grand bargain for --,nan
for,"It may -- hey, it may well be.",nan
against,Clever redefinition.,nan
for,"Nobody limited the sort of scope of options moving forward. So, no, I think, look, the Chinese have put on the table the freeze and freeze. It doesn't seem as though the North Koreans have even picked up on that yet, right? So, Kim Jong Un would freeze sort of the development of nuclear weapons and we would not have any more military exercises in South Korea for the time being. I think David's right. We have to get back to the table. You may laugh at the idea of basketball diplomacy, but actually, you know, that is what broke through with the Chinese, right? The ping-ping diplomacy was the first thing. Maybe we have a round robin tournament with North Korea, China, the United States, and South Korea and we begin to break the ice. And then we go into more formal talks with North Korea. So, you know -- and then we move into, you know, United States, you know, formed some sort of peace treaty, right? And then we moved to the United States establishing a representative office. I mean, there are many -- one of the interesting things about this conundrum is that there are so many different elements to it. There are so many different things that could come into play. And I think we're finally at a point where the Chinese are actually desiring to do something.",nan
against,"I’ll turn it around and say no this time, and for two essential reasons: first, that others in the region wouldn’t stand for Chinese regional dominance. This is not the Ming Dynasty or the Sung Dynasty or the tribute system obtained and existed and others dutifully fell into the Chinese hierarchy. The Chinese may want that, but I can tell you with the exception of South Korea, not many in Asia want to go down that path. And secondly, there are -- well, there are other actors of significance in the region: Japan, India, Indonesia, and indeed, the United States. So they would balance against China: the iron law of international relations. So I don’t foresee it for that reason. The second reason I don’t foresee Chinese dominance is because the Chinese are very capable of overstepping and overreaching economically and in other ways. They are -- like many other great powers, they are oftentimes bullying and intimidating and -- I’m going to have to stop there.",nan
for,"I declare no. So I agree very much with what David had to say. I would also focus not just on East Asia, Southeast Asia but Central Asia, focus on Russia. The fact that the Chinese are increasingly just dominated places like Kazakhstan, as well as economically East Siberia and the Russians are deeply uncomfortable with it. They don’t have the population, but they have the military capability. And the Chinese don’t know how to manage it. One belt, one road: They’re putting all this money in a lot of countries, but Russia not so much. I think -- Well, it’s this, you know, trillion dollars that the Chinese are putting. It’s kind of like their Marshall Plan but without liberal democracy at the end. And that’s a short definition. The -- but I will tell you that while I don’t think they’re destined for regional dominance, I think it’s quite possible they’re destined for global dominance, and that really depends on whether or not, as Elon Musk says, they get AI right before other people do. That, for me, is the big question. No surprise, I’m a no. I think destined is a big word, and it demands a big commitment, and I’m not prepared to make that commitment. I see three significant impediments to China becoming the dominant regional power. First, right now the U.S. is the dominant military power, as General Petraeus said, by an order of magnitude. And it has no -- it’s demonstrated no indication of being interested in abdicating that position. Second, in economic terms, although China is a very important player in the region, and indeed the largest trading partner for most of the countries, it is an inconsequential source of foreign direct investment for all the countries in the region except for Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar which I think many people would find surprising. And then third goes back to exactly what David said, and that is that nobody else in the region wants China to be the dominant regional power. And so, you have India and Japan and Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, all working together and in concert with the United States on occasion to make sure that that does not happen.",nan
against,"You know, on the one hand, you have three brilliant area experts, and on the other hand, you have the possibility of a real conversation. So I'm going to go with yes. And I'll -- Oh, well, you can take the law professor out of the law school, but -- so, look, global dominance I do not think is the inevitable destiny for China because, for all the reasons that we've discussed, it is not yet in a position to achieve that. It may never be in a position to achieve that. China already has regional economic dominance on issue after issue after issue on country after country after country. Over a long period of time, other countries in the region will still have a desire. There's no question they have a desire to retain a close strategic relationship with the U.S. to protect themselves against China. But thatwill become increasingly difficult as the U.S. is less and less willing to provide that and no longer sees the benefits of doing that. I would say the Trump Administration's policy here is the leading edge of what may be a 50 or 75-year change in American attitude. Take the question of whether the U.S. would, at present, use military force to defend Taiwan. If, in your hearts, you think the answer to that question is no, then the answer to this question is yes.",nan
for,"Can I ask a question? Oh, no? Okay. So, we'll go back to Noah in a second. What does it mean to say that China has regional economic dominance? What does that mean in your mind?",nan
against,"It means that China is the largest and most significant trading partner of every country in the region, broadly defined. That means that its economic leverage over those countries is enormous. It means that capital flows in both directions are great and growing. It means that the cultural influences that come with greater economic exchange are also going to grow over time. And with respect to forms of governance, which we touched on a bit earlier -- but I would have loved for us to have a chance to say more about -- even though it's true that none of those countries are trying to govern the way that China does, it's also true that the bloom is off the rose of the idea that democracy on the U.S. model is the best way to govern your country. And in that sense, that can be seen as Chinese influence insofar as there's increasing recognition that countries actually can get away with dis-aggregating political reform from economic reform. I know we would like to say -- and David's written a book saying that that's a short-term thing; in the long run, we'll all see that they are linked. But I -- you know, I'm not so sure about it.",nan
for,"Well, I just wanted to know, you know, because we can never agree, basically -- not on any one of these points. So --",nan
against,"Well, that's fine. It makes it fun.",nan
for,"Interesting, right? So, no. I think -- you know, I make two points, I guess. First, whatever China's regional economic power is, it's not enough to persuade the Philippines to change course with regard to the South China Sea, right? So, five years or so worth of boycotting Philippine exports -- some exports. It's not enough to make South Korea change course THAAD, right, as they're boycotting Lottethe major South Korean department store. And again, China is a very distant third to the European Union and Japan when it comes to investment in Southeast Asia. So, and it's not clear to me at all that China's cultural and political influence is going to flow out of its being a large trading partner -- not to mention the fact that with many, many of these countries, it's running a trade surplus, which irritates a lot of these countries.",nan
against,Well --,nan
for,"So, I'm not sure that it --",nan
against,-- I want to respond --,nan
for,-- endears the countries to China in a way that is going to grant China greater influence.,nan
against,"So, if there's one lesson, to my mind, of the last century, it's of the U.S. and its dominance -- is that dominance does not lead -- you can dominate people without endearing yourself to them. And in fact, to the contrary. Dominating people never makes you feel endeared to them. My point is not -- I completely agree with you that it will always be in the geostrategic interest of the Philippines to protect the South China Sea or of South Korea to try to maintain aerial defenses. My point is they can only do that because of us. Those are only credible positions -- the Philippines can only stand up, quote unquote, to China -- South Korea can only stand up, quote unquote, to China, if they have us behind them. And if the U.S. over time -- this is really my key point -- if the U.S., over time, ceases to think -- and I mean the U.S. as a people -- I don't mean foreign policy experts like, you know, people around the table -- if ordinary people think that it's not in the U.S. interest to put a huge part of our military budget into constructing a military that enables us to defend, you know, the Pacific States -- -- then these countries will have no choice. They will still feel the same way, but there will be realities that will interfere -- -- on the table. I think you'd need to dis-aggregate dominance and you'd need to dis-aggregate Asia. As I said, I just came back from half a year in Southeast Asia. There, Noah is absolutely correct. China has economic -- primarily economic dominance. Japan is also a very significant actor. The United States less so, and declining in Southeast Asia. Northeast Asia, that's not the case at all. But if you look at the other indices of China's regional posture, military, cultural, political, diplomatic, there you don't find anything approaching dominance. China's not the major diplomatic actor in Asia. Its military is -- I think General Petraeus was indicating earlier -- and Ian mentioned -- is a regional military. It's growing very quickly, and certainly it's stronger than any other military in the region except for the United States, but it's not -- they haven't had a war since 1979, and it's not -- they're an unproven force, I would argue. Political model, I don't see others wishing to emulate that, and culture. Does China have soft power? Does the Chinese culture and system travel? Does it have universality in Asia or elsewhere? I say very limited.",nan
for,"The Chinese have been picking up a lot of influence. I mean, Taiwan, Hong Kong, it's very clear that they have effective dominion over that in a way that the Americans would not have ceded even 10 years ago. And I think over the coming 10 years, there'll be other countries that we feel that way about. Pakistan may well be one. Certainly, many of the Southeast Asians. Singapore is quite concerned, as a consequence. But there are two reasons that I really don't buy the idea that this is destined. One is not the economics. If it was -- if Asia was just about economics, I would feel much more comfortable with this formulation, certainly with the fact that the Chinese can write really big checks and they can bring the whole apparatus of the state together with it. But the fact is that, unlike the United States which is surrounded by Canada, Mexico, and big bodies of water, Asia is geopolitically fraught, and it's only going to become more so going forward. So, I think that idea that China's going to be able to be regionally dominant in a part of the world that's likely to see vastly more conflict going forward, I don't buy it. Second point is a lot of people talk about the coming Chinese century. There's been an American century, now there's a Chinese century. I don't think we do centuries anymore. Destined implies to me the sweep of history where the Chinese are going to be in charge. When I look at China's military in 20 years, I think about things like drone swarms. I think about things like infantry and I don't know what the balance of power in Asia's going to be looking like, but I do know that the idea that China's going to be able to take manifest their plans of building buildings over the last 30 years and just plow them through for another 15, I wouldn't put a lot of money in stake of that. So it's possible that they'll get there. If you wanted to bet on any one country in the region being dominant, I'd bet on China, but I wouldn't bet much. I'd bet much more on the United States still be regionally dominant in the Western hemisphere.",nan
against,"Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that strikes me across the debate is that my -- the views that I'm expressing seem to be more skeptical of the U.S. public being willing to sustain a global position of dominance than my colleagues seem to think. Yeah.",nan
for,"No way, but it doesn't change any of the points I just made.",nan
against,"Okay, so I think -- I think --",nan
for,"Well, either way, I mean, the whole --",nan
against,"-- yeah, I mean, we -- you know, the subject of our debate tonight isn't primarily, ""What does the U.S. public think?"" But I do urge people to ask themselves if the U.S. -- if they would support in their hearts or would predict that the U.S. would intervene military to protect not just Taiwan but any of the -- Japan, let's say, or --",nan
for,"We're talking about -- Treaty -- Japan is a treaty ally. I mean, we are terrified of treaties.",nan
against,"I know, and what I'm saying --",nan
for,So you're saying that we will back out of our treaty?,nan
against,"Correct. What I'm saying, Liz -- what I'm saying is that in the world that we all occupy of formal -- formally trained political scientists with a deep knowledge of political science norms, it's impossible to say that the United States would back away from its commitments which is embodied in a treaty of international law. And what I'm saying is that, you know, if people ask themselves inwardly, ""Would you support the U.S. doing so, even in the presence of a treaty?"" I think many people in the room, and many, many people in the country, and a huge number of people who voted for Donald Trump would say that the answer is, ""No way. I never heard of the treaty, definitely don't care about it."" And if that's --",nan
for,We should take -- we should take a vote right here.,nan
against,"If we weren't doing this on radio, I wouldn't be adverse to a show of hands. I've actually, you know, tried this, asking a room full of military people. Everyone says, ""Of course we would defend them. That's why we have a Navy."" And then I ask the room, ""Well ."" And everybody says, first of all, ""What are you talking about?"" like, ""Of course we wouldn't do that."" So my -- the point that I'm making here is simply that, if the U.S. public can't sustain that sort of commitment over the long term, if it doesn't see a clear economic payoff to regional dominance in Asia, for example, that is likely to shift the geo-strategy, the geopolitics of the region. And, again, in the absence of the U.S. position, China will de facto dominate the region. And, you know – Okay, sorry.",nan
for,"Yeah, I want to make a totally different point, and that is that we have not even raised the possibility that China's not going to be in a position to be a regionally dominant power because, actually, its economy is going to collapse or at least is going to slow down so significantly that it's not going to be able to continue on the path that it's on. Not really anxious. No, I can -- I agreed with Liz there, but I just can't see the -- if the Americans pull out, to me, that does not ensure Chinese dominance. Instead, it makes it much more likely that we're going to have very significant confrontation. The U.S. staying in, I think, helps with stability.",nan
against,"Totally agree with that. I hope -- by the way, I hope I'm wrong.",nan
