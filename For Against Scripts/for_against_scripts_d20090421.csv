for,"Yes, that, that’s the hardcover— Yes. We changed it ‘cause there was some confusion. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, thank you so much for joining us tonight to consider this most important topic. Before delving in I still have in my mind a song I heard on the way to the airport on the radio, which went like this. “I’m not a saint but I’m not a sinner, everything’s cool as long as I’m getting thinner.” Which, I think, expresses a profound truth, actually. It’s a serious question. In a society in which the self is the body, to some degree, as long as we’re getting thinner, do we even believe that there is such a thing as a sexual right, and a sexual wrong. Nobody wants to judge. Adultery is now a lifestyle choice. A 22-year-old woman from San Diego, is now auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder. Right? And we’re not supposed to judge. And yet I would submit that we do judge, all the time. When I was living here in Manhattan some 10 years ago, I’ll never forget the time when I was innocently buying my Metro pass, and sipping my coffee, and a man came up from behind me and barked at me and he said, you know, you shouldn’t drink those frappaccinos, they’re very fattening. And I was shocked that a perfect stranger would presume to judge my beverage choices that way. But then I realized that everybody has a notion of right and wrong and to this man frappaccinos were just wrong. My worthy opponent, Sydney Barrows, writes in her memoir, Mayflower Madame, that a DNS in the call girl business stood for “Do not send.” Men who were obnoxious or who had really gross apartments, she wouldn’t send her girls to such men. And she also writes, “Whenever I read about a business who had done something I didn’t approve of, such as a building an ugly high-rise in a residential neighborhood, I added his name to the list, just in case he ever called us.” Which I thought was really funny, also. To some people, building an ugly high-rise is morally wrong. It’s an offense against the aesthetic order. Ladies and gentlemen, I would submit to you that paying for sex is at least as wrong as building an ugly high-rise. Perhaps more so. Why, because we’re using— we’re talking about using a human being as a means to your ends. Today people want to believe that paying for sex is just like paying for a hamburger. But a sexual transaction is different, because it teaches on the deepest, most personal aspects of ourselves. The proof that sex is different, in my opinion, is our response to the terrible crime of rape. If paying for sex were as morally neutral as paying for a hamburger, well then, rape is akin to just forcing someone to eat a hamburger. Right? But of course it is not. It is a horrible crime, that is serious, precisely because sexuality touches on the deepest, most personal aspect of our humanity. And to take something so intimate, and to turn it into a commodity, has far-reaching, devastating effects, for men, women and children. Everyone agrees that after the Netherlands adopted legalization that this has added fuel to the gangs who trafficked in underage girls, and that the abuse in child prostitution exploded rather than was reduced. It’s time to ask why. Well, firstly what we value in women, eventually trickles down to girls. For example today we place a lot of value on hotness in women, have you noticed this? And so, now in, for example in the Bratts Babies video, which is watched by three- and four-year-old girls by the way, you can hear cartoon babies singing songs about “being hotter than hot, show what you’ve got, ready or not.” For three-year-olds. What we value in women inevitably trickles down to girls. Secondly prostitution, like all industries, is demand-led. Someone could go to great trouble manufacturing coats made from cockroaches, but since nobody wants cockroach coats, the supplier would soon find that there’s no market, no demand, and no money in it, except may Ozzy Osbourne would buy it. But because prostitution is demand-led, it’s the paying for sex that’s a problem. That’s what creates the demand, and given that the average age of entry into prostitution is 13 or 14 years old, I think this presents a huge moral problem. I receive a ton of emails from girls who are 14, 15, leave home, because they’ve been abused, only to try to escape prostitution. Unfortunately at the time, one writes to me, “It was all I felt I had to offer the world, my body. As you can no doubt guess, I was molested by my father for many years when I was a child. It’s why my mother let me leave. So in a sense I was raised to believe my body had only one use, and I was worth only this one thing.” We can talk later about why the molestation rates for prostitutes are so high, why the suicide rates are so high. But, right now I wanna focus on the fact that the problem is that nobody knows if these girls are 14 or 18. And, we think about the sheer number of sex slaves in captivity in the US, we’re talking about, anything from 30,000 to 50,000. It’s staggering, and it’s sickening. We’re talking about girls that are having sex with 20 to 30 men per day, one girl told the New York Times about her cell of traffickers, her captors offered three age ranges of sex partners, toddler to age four, age five to 12, and teens as well as the damage group…where they could do anything that they wanted. When one of the Mexican child-trafficking rings was busted in a house in Plainfield, New Jersey, uh, another Mexican ring was recently busted--but this one was a few years ago—the neighbors, in retrospect thought about all the cars that came, and all of the girls that… left that house to buy candy, but they always said no one knew what was going on. I’m always struck that the neighbors always say this, well somebody knew what was going on because someone was paying for the sex. To those who are against trafficking, but they insist that some women have nothing else to sell but their bodies, I say that they suffer from a real lack of imagination. About the power of the human spirit and about the strength of women in particular and if you keep up with the Harvard Business Review, you may have noticed, that they’re now talking about micro-loans to poor women and only lending them, only having these loans to poor women. Right? Because they notice that the poorest of women reinvest in the household and the men do not. So…we have to believe in the women first, it takes a risk to give them that loan. If instead we demand their bodies instead of appealing to their intelligence, it’s this philosophy of this is all she can do, and the not too subtle misogyny behind it, that feeds the demand and expectations that cause the problem. Thank you— Thank you.",1.0
against,"It’s appropriate for that branch of show business known as the academic profession. It works quite well. Thank you very much, thank you, Wendy, for starting this off in a serious and interesting manner. I have to say, I’m quite confounded by this, because it’s quite clearly wrong to pay for wrong sex. There is no one in this room I daresay, who will shed a tear for anyone who is jailed for trafficking in toddlers. That I think is an absurdity, to start a discussion about the very serious, momentous issue of human sexuality. So, we’re all opposed to coercive, we’re all opposed unequivocally, I’m sure, to the kind of stories we hear about the Russian Mafia trafficking women whose passports are stolen from them and then they have to work off their fare and so on. These are all obvious. They’re not debatable. I won’t debate them, therefore. But what we have with respect to, Wendy just heard is , a perfect contemporary exposition of the early 20th century sociological fallacy, which is you look for a deviant phenomenon, and attribute to that the nature of the normal. So by talking about rape, talking about toddlers being abused sexually, this then frames the entire discussion of what you guys and gals may decide to do in your own homes with your own lust, with your own love, and that is simply methodologically wrong. Furthermore, it begins from a premise that legal distinctions constitute the vocabulary of life’s distinctions. And again, this is simply methodologically improper. So for example in American sociology many early sociologists would look at prison behavior and say ah-ha, this is what life is really like. It’s not. It’s a prison. It’s what it is because of what it is. It’s not reflective. And furthermore, I get here, and forgive me for maybe being, counter-casting here, but I think this entire argument somehow is profoundly disrespectful to females. If you want to see people paying for sex, I suggest you go to the ground floor of Bloomingdale’s. The place is full of women paying for garments, colors, clasps, various instruments of torture— lust, you name it, but they’re paying for their own sense of themselves as sexual creatures, and they’re not on that floor because they don’t like sex and they don’t like what it means. And furthermore, what it tells us about is, that there’s an inner economy to sex, that doesn’t have to do with raping toddlers, with raping girls who are abused by their fathers, please. If you’re raped by your father you’ve got a problem independently of the one we’re discussing. That’s just how it is. There was a remarkable story in the Times, last couple of weeks ago, about a website called SeekingArrangement.com. In this website, men and women can sign up to be -- essentially a rich Wall Street executive, thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz for the metaphor—to be set up and go through graduate school. Now in this system, which is not explicitly about sex, it’s about a wide variety of things, the ratio of women applying to men, is 10 to one. Free choice. 10 to one. These are probably women you know, I know, who knows. But the fact is that—and this is just one anecdote and it’s not typical of everything, please don’t overextend it, but the fact is that women have a deal with men which requires that they have some relationship with men, especially if they’re inclined to reproduce which still 80 percent of women in North America. And women know that they will have five to eight years when they’re out of the labor force, and, it helps to have a guy around the place. And so… The fact is that if we’re looking just now, Mr. Donvan mentioned the current male-female balance. In this current recession or depression or whatever it’s called, 82 percent of the jobs lost are male jobs. That means that, women will not have a guy—if they want one…this is free choice, please, I’m not an obligatory heterosexual mastermind here but if women want a mate, then they’re not going to have…one of those men that has lost a job. It’s a complicated argument but it’s a long story, I’m an anthropologist, we’re interested in what people around the world do, 90—over 90 percent of human marriages are arranged. They’re determined by families in terms of the larger interests of the two clans, they usually involve a bride price or a dowry, or something like that in which the male usually commits himself to sustaining the female, we don’t do it with cattle, we do it with some exotic unit called the diamond ring. An engagement ring is the world’s stupidest object, the moment you take it out of the store, it’s lost 80 percent of its value, if in fact it has any value at all, just ask DeBeers, there’s—they’re crying. But, the guy has to pay two months’ after-tax income for this diamond ring, to give to the gal to assure her that he’s going to be okay. Now, if he’s not, she keeps the ring. But the point is that this is a— This is a classic anthropological phenomenon, my time is quickly run out, I had no idea that… —it would—",1.0
for,"It is not. Thank you. Thanks. Some words hide the truth. Just as torture is named, “enhanced interrogation,” and the logging of old-growth forests is called the Healthy Forest Initiative, so also prostitution is named a choice, a job, work, a victimless crime, and on Craigslist it’s called “a wide range of personal meeting and relationship opportunities.” These pimp-messaged slogans are good for business but there’s not much truth to them. What’s wrong with prostitution is the renting out of a woman’s mouth, vagina, or anus, and what it does to her, psychologically. What’s wrong with prostitution, and what’s wrong with buying sex, are the same things that are wrong with other forms of violence against women, incest, rape, and battery. I’ve been researching prostitution for 15 years, we’ve interviewed 900 women, men, and transgendered people in prostitution, in nine countries on five continents. And over the course of that time we’ve also interviewed 500 johns. Prostitution is not a choice because the precise conditions that make a choice are absent. For example, equality with buyers, and physical safety, and real alternatives. If you imagine a pyramid, remember that only about the top 5 percent of all women in prostitution are at the top of that pyramid. These are people that are privileged by race and class. The other 95 percent don’t have those kinds of privilege or alternatives for escape. Let me give you some examples of the sex inequality, the race-ethnic inequality, and the economic inequality in prostitution that are often invisible. A woman in Lusaka, who knew that five blow jobs would get her a sack of mealy meal to feed her kids. That’s not a choice. A woman in India who worked in an office where she concluded that she might as well be paid for the sexual harassment that was expected of her anyway, in her job. That’s not a choice. The teen in California who said that in her neighborhood, boys grew up to be dealers and pimps and girls to be ‘hos. She was the third generation of prostituted women in her family. And prostitution more severely harms people who are indigenous or ethnically marginalized because of their lack of alternatives. That’s not a choice. Or the young woman sold by her parents in a brothel in Nevada. She took six different psychiatric drugs to make it through the day, selling sex, that’s not a choice, or Ashley Dupre, who was bought by Governor Spitzer. Dupre ran away from what she called an abusive home at 17, she’d been homeless, she had a drug problem, a convicted New York pimp bragged that he turned her out. And at 17 pornography was made of her by a man who had a prostitution conviction. The Emperors Club, where Spitzer bought her, was run by pimps who charged a lot because they said it was high-class call girls. But it was the same as any other pimps, they took their 50 percent off the top. Like a majority of johns, Spitzer most likely enticed, coerced or persuaded her with money to put her life on the line by not using a condom. That’s not a freely made choice. Women in prostitution face a statistical likelihood of weekly rape. A Canadian woman in prostitution said, what’s rape for others is normal for us. A woman at a legal brothel in Nevada said, it’s like you sign a contract to be raped. And in Chicago, the same frequency of rape was reported by women in both escort and street prostitution. Women in prostitution are seen as body parts or fake girlfriends and their feelings don’t matter, and they’re not seen as human which is perhaps why they’re murdered at a higher rate than any other group of women ever studied. The emotional consequences of prostitution are the same in widely varying cultures. Whether it’s high-class or low-class. Whether it’s legal or illegal, whether it’s in a brothel, strip club, massage parlor, or the street. Symptoms of emotional distress in all forms of prostitution, are off the charts. Depression, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, dissociation… Two thirds of the women we interviewed, and all of the people we interviewed in prostitution, two thirds of them had PTSD at the same level of the most emotionally traumatized groups ever studied by psychologists. That would be combat vets, women who had just been raped, women seeking shelter from batterers, and also state-sponsored torture survivors. What’s wrong with sex is what johns themselves tell us about it. For example, if you look at it, it’s paid rape. She has to do what you want. I use them like I might use any other amenity, a restaurant, or a public convenience. It’s like renting an organ for ten minutes. In research interviews with johns, we found that their abuse of women extended to women who had not been prostituted yet. The johns that bought the most women in prostitution were the most likely to commit sexually coercive acts with non-prostituting women. When women are turned into objects that men masturbate into, it causes immense psychological harm to the person acting as a receptacle. Please don’t be fooled by people who tell buying sex is just another job. It’s wrong to set aside a special class of women, those who are the most vulnerable among us, for men’s sexual use. What’s wrong with paying for sex is it’s the business of sexual exploitation. Thanks.",1.0
against,"This is a very serious matter, and to take it seriously, I propose we start by looking at human diversity. Consider an example, you're a nineteen year old American soldier, and you’ve been drafted to fight the Nazis in France, and you have, to put it bluntly, never done it before. And before the event of a big battle, you go and you buy sex from a Frenchwoman who maybe needs the money to feed her kids. Or maybe you're a young man and you have sexual problems, and you hire a sexual surrogate to help you with those problems, and you go on to have a loving and successful marriage. Or maybe you're a handicap person who, for whatever reasons finds that a better way to achieve sexual ends is to pay for sex. These are all examples of the diversity of the human condition. What the other side is neglecting is this diversity, a diversity of individuals, a diversity of situations, a diversity of cultures. If you look at the broad sweep, the history of mankind, there’s a big, long book by Nils Ringdahl on the history of prostitution. He looks at Medieval India, he looks at the Tang Dynasty, he looks at Renaissance courtesans, and what you find is a wide variance of outcomes. You find a lot of cases where things go fine, and you find a lot of cases where things don’t go fine. I propose what we have here is a human activity which very frequently is badly regulated, and when it is badly regulated, you will see massive amounts of abuse, unfairness, exploitation. And I recognize the other side in pointing out these abuses. But the problem is that it is a badly regulated activity. There are many, many cases, three of which I’ve outlined, where consenting adults meet, they meet voluntarily, both of them are better off, and buying of the sex is not wrong. All of the abuses listed by the other side you can find in another institution called marriage. If you go around the world and go to poorer cultures and ask within marriage how often is there rape, how often is there abuse, exploitation, unequal terms all the way down the line, women who are too young to be married, you see this happen all the time. But to go back to our resolution, the correct answer is not to condemn marriage, to say that marriage is wrong. In a way you can think of prostitution as a bit like, dare I say, banking. As we know here in New York, banking is very frequently badly regulated. And you find in many countries, believe it or not right here in Manhattan, you find examples of abuses, fraud, exploitation in banking. But again, the correct attitude or answer is not to say that all banking is wrong. There’s simply a category error being made by the other side in this debate. And again, think back to your core intuitions, there are many, many cases, millions, billions of cases in human history where informed, consenting adults have gotten together and someone has bought sex from another person. And again, I am submitting that these cases are not wrong. Go take a look at New Zealand, where prostitution is legal. It has been legal since 2003. The other side didn't mention New Zealand at all. There’s a big long report written by the New Zealand government about how this experiment has gone. Uh, there’s a lot of evidence that it’s actually gone pretty well. A survey of the prostitutes revealed that seventy-three percent of them do it to pay household expenses, twenty-four percent of them are doing it to pay for education, thirty-eight percent are doing it to help out their children, or support an older family member, and the rates of abuse, coercion, and rape, the rate of rape is extremely low. It seems to be lower in prostitution than in a lot of other settings. But again, these are not the examples you're hearing. The point, again, that I'm stressing is this diversity, that when you have consenting adults there are, again, many cases where it’s simply possible that it is a okay thing to do. There are many other sectors of the economy that we can look at. If you ask the Bureau of Labor Statistics, what is the most dangerous job in the United States, at least according to the bureau, it’s being a fisherman and going out on a fishing boat. It’s an extremely hazardous occupation. There’s a lot of loss of life, loss of limb, people being crippled, unfair conditions, illegal immigrants who work under conditions that are not right. And again, these are real problems. But to think of it in terms of morality, we ask, what is the moral issue here? The moral issue is when you have unsafe fishing boats, or when fishing is not regulated properly, or when we as society don’t think about fishing and industrial safety in all the right ways. No one thinks to say fishing is wrong, buying fish is wrong, fishing boats are wrong. Again, it is simply this category error. I would even submit that if we take the point of view suggested by the opposition, the more we try to blackball, ban, condemn an activity that we all know has existed in every society, it always pops up, there is always a black market, there are many different ways of trading sex. It is not going away. If there’s one thing that we all should realize in this room, is that the buying of sex is not going away. What we want is that it happen in a better way rather than a worse way. We need to have a constructive attitude. I do not hear that constructive attitude from the other side. What I hear is an attitude that will put this practice under a greater veil of secrecy, it will make it harder for the people who are selling to go to the law when they have problems, it will make it more of a social disgrace, and it will worsen the problems with the working conditions rather than improve it. I’d also note, just as an aside, just how culturally-bound and institution specific the complaints are. For instance, in Melissa Farley’s presentation, it’s always man and woman, man buying from woman. There’s no talk of gay prostitution, there’s not much talk of the broader sweep of human history, of practices of dowries, of the numerous tribes in human history who have taken very different attitudes than that which we hold. In fact, if you polled the majority of human beings over time, the most likely answer you're going to hear is that the people who are doing something wrong are the men who are trying to get sex without paying for it simply by seducing the woman. Anyway, thank you all.",1.0
for,"would like to quote, to respond to what Sydney said, and quote from her book, which is, she said, “A call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates sin.” I would use the word prostitution and not sin, so I would say a call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates prostitution. I think that’s the whole point we’re making here, that shouldn't be the choice. If we’re seeking an end to inequality between men and women, if we’re seeking an end to violence against men and women, women should not have to make the choice between poverty and education, paying the next month’s rent, and prostitution.",2.0
against,"I'm sorry that this whole discussion now is focused on prostitution. I thought that what we were talking about was the economics of human sexuality, and that is really the parsimonious fundamental issue that we have here. People engage, and I mention the engagement ring in marriages, which have immense responsibilities to the next generation, to communities, to relatives, to friends, and we’re somehow putting the immensely complex and, and both luxurious and difficult business of being an adult lover into the same rubric as prostitutes who, and I think there’s an argument to be made that it, yes it’s terrible, now we’re starting to hear how this all expresses sexual inequality and racial equality. Please, let’s try to limit the discussion to the subject of human sexuality and stop including every single allergic category that comes into these discussions—",2.0
for,"Yeah, I think it’s actually the negative team that is equating, in equating marriage and dating with paying for sex. The negative team is conflating things that should not be conflated. First of all, in prostitution there’s no shared desire. Right? Which means one person is an object. That's a big difference. Also, marriages in which there is a transactional element, in which it’s, okay, you give me this, I’ll give you this, there’s a fifty-fifty exchange of services, end up failing precisely because that’s not what a marriage is. Right? But I want to address the free choice issue, because Miss Barrows says that she doesn't recognize any of the girls, or the men. So I just want to refresh her memory. Because I thought her book was really interesting. And she said, quote, quite a few of the new girls that she used had no money and nothing appropriate to wear, so I would take them to Saks and charge whatever they needed on my credit card. They would pay me back from their future earnings. When she found a fabulous ground floor apartment for her office, which was super cheap, the rate was made up for by making the girls sleep with the landlord, who she said was only interested in one thing, and lived in a seedy semi-furnished apartment and made them feel cheap. She says the girls weren't crazy about the plan, and really one can see why. Is that free choice? That doesn't sound like empowerment to me. To me empowerment comes from actualizing your unique potential in the world. That’s what empowerment is. Realizing you're unique, and you have a unique contribution to make to this world, not being forced to sleep with a landlord to enrich somebody else’s pockets. I'm sorry.",2.0
against,"Our moderator is a very objective fellow, and what he’s pointed out is that there are many different worlds here. And this is true. And what I would like you to do is to think through the implications of there being many different worlds. The other side is asking for a blanket condemnation of a practice. I'm asking you to see many different worlds, to understand this diversity of human preference, experience, and culture. And once we view the debate in this terms, in my view, the correct answer is to side with us, that there is no blanket condemnation, it is a diverse set of situations with many entirely acceptable outcomes, a lot of very bad outcomes, and the other side is simply pressing the emotional buttons again and again and again on the bad outcomes, and trying to press all of our buttons. And I urge you to resist that, to stand back, look at the bigger picture, and do not issue the blanket condemnation. There are many instances where the practice is badly regulated and we observe bad outcomes. Trafficking is an example. None of us are defending that, but that’s not the proposition.",2.0
for,"would like to address this trafficked toddlers issue, which is basically ranking victims. When you decide that a battered woman is not really harmed because her arm wasn’t broken, or a slave isn't harmed as much if they're in the house as opposed to in the fields, or a woman in prostitution is not harmed as much if she’s a little older. And I’d like to tell you that a friend of mine who works in the field of child prostitution recently told me that there’s now a move to only rank genuine victims of prostitution of children if they're pre-pubescent. So the age is always going down, we’re always carving out some group that it’s okay to use in prostitution. I think when we make these false distinctions, we’re agreeing to set aside a class of human beings, the ones that make more, they're a little older, a little this, a little that. We’re setting aside some people who’s suffering we agree to ignore. Right— Yes, I’d like to address that, because I think those are really important points that he raised. If you show me anyone who, a man who is handicapped, I will give you a man with the same disability who has a woman who loves him. And women are not that superficial. And if somebody, if, I'm sorry, there’s a lot of women who love men… And, and… If there’s somebody who’s using prostitution as an excuse, I think that's a problem. And I, about this issue of, that prostitution is really altruism because it’s feeding, you know, poor women, and that’s part of the diversity, I understand that, but I fail to see how that justifies it from the male perspective. If you really want to be altruistic, just give her a loaf of bread. It’s not what we heard from women in prostitution that this is their main concern, is physical, even physical injuries. The main concern is to get out and to figure out how to get out. And the thing that causes them the most suffering is the psychological damage that’s extremely long lasting. The bruises and the--they even heal from the rapes. So this is what I’ve heard. I think when someone, let me, cac I say one other thing— …about disability? I think prejudice against someone who has a physical or emotional disability is wrong. The cure to that prejudice is not selling someone to that person so they can have sex. The cure is to address the disability-ism, and the looks-ism in our culture.",2.0

for,"actually have read the New Zealand report, and I also have studied prostitution in New Zealand, and one of the things that happened in New Zealand is what a Maori community activist called an apartheid system of prostitution. In New Zealand, the Maori people are prostituted much younger and much longer, and they're more frequently homeless, so we again have that situation in New Zealand of a special class of people who are more vulnerable— Well, let’s talk about the regulation. What happens in real life in New Zealand, to stick with that for a moment, is that zoning is the sine qua non of regulation of prostitution. The people who have a lot of money don’t want it in their backyards, so it’s zoned into the neighborhoods of poorer people, thereby increasing trafficking, johns, solicitations, and their general vulnerability to all aspects of the sex industry. This happened in New Zealand, so— Sorry. just wanted to know, I'm just— No, I do. I just wanted to know, because I haven't heard the answer to this, on this point, if I may. If it’s a question of being badly regulated, then why do we see in the countries where it’s been legalized, we see that the trafficking has increased. Nobody has addressed my point that nobody asks the ages of the girls when they pay for sex, and that’s the link between the trafficking. And no one has addressed that so far. Absolutely. No problem with that. can see it getting slippery. Not if the man were my husband. don’t know, I mean, I think this is a kind of…extreme example— think what you're— don’t think what— think what you're trying to do with the question is collapse the distinction between human touch and the significance of sex. And I think sex is different and just because you're giving someone a massage, I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that. But I think that sexuality is something different, and you can always come up with an extreme example to collapse that distinction, but that just begs the question.",2.0
against,"Well, first of all I, there’s a kind of a historical component to the other side. There’s a famous syndrome in Turkey, rural Turkey, the Natasha. The Natasha is a Russian woman who goes to a small town in Turkey and capsizes the entire system because she’s sexually available. Now, the reason Natasha is there is because the men in Russia are drunk all the time, they have very low longevity, they are improper and not very useful husbands, the result is the birth rate in Russia, which is plummeting, it’s a major crisis actually. But the reason for the Natashas comes out of a really poignant human story. And I continue to feel that we’re losing not the nicety of the argument here, we’re losing the grandeur of the human issues that force some people into a small, intimate room, where they do something, and yes, it causes some people the distress that we’ve heard about. None of us on this side applauds that. At the same time, this is not exactly a trivial issue and I’m afraid it’s being reduced in its importance into a sentimental kind of grab bag of victim complaints— Well… Because it’s easy. It’s all very—it’s easy in this country and everywhere else to talk about racial, class distinctions and so on. Many of the clients of prostitutes I suspect, don’t have a great deal more money than the prostitutes, I don’t know. Essentially what I’m trying to do here is, get the argument into the larger context of, of human sexuality, and away from a relatively, again sentimental concern. There was just—if I may make one final comment on this, there was recently the publication and we’ve known in the primatology trade about it for years, that it turns out that chimp males who hunt, will give meat to women who— —will—if—a female— Maybe. To female chimps, and the—but the fascinating thing is it’s not just a quid pro quo. Because these become sustained and durable relationships, in which the male is a consort and an associate of the female, even when she’s not in estrus and therefore sexually available. And that is, it’s kind of haunting. Because it suggests that, this is actually a more elegant phenomenon than just giving meat to a female. Uh—",2.0
for,"I’m— I have to admit I’m— Sure— Sorry. I’m surprised by the negatives’ reliance on the argument that it’s not going away and historically, a lot of people have been doing it. We’re not debating whether it’s common, to pay for sex, we’re not debating whether it’s happened, we’re arguing whether it’s right or wrong. And, I think, I mean, if you bring up primatology, I’m just—I have to bring up, Mr. Tiger, your book which I really enjoyed The Pursuit of Pleasure which was a pleasure to read…by the way, I must say. I found one example really interesting, you mentioned female genital mutilation. And you said what’s significant about female genital mutilation, is that men, males want sexual access to women, but they cannot bear it when other men have access to their mates. A common solution to the problem is the double standard, of which female genital mutilation you say is the extreme representation. Here the effort is to try to control both sex and reproduction at once, by imposing strict controls on the sexuality of women. In an effort to prevent their wives’ impregnation by men other than themselves. Now, I think we can always, you bring up chimps and primatology, we can explain yes female genital mutilation in terms of primatology but I hope we can all agree that that’s still wrong. And, just because— —just because the chimps can provide an explanation doesn’t mean that it’s right.",2.0
against,"Probably not. There are plenty of cases, as I am more than willing to admit, where what goes on, is wrong. But again, look at the resolution. The key point is that there are diverse practices, and multiple worlds. What you’re finding from the other side, is to take a woman in a difficult situation, choosing her best option. I’m saying, blame the difficult situation. They’re saying, blame the best option. It’s a very simple choice. Which one are you going to blame. Again I say blame the difficult situation.",2.0
for,"We’re talking— —about the evidence of harm here, not a moral or emotional reaction. And the evidence of harm, I think the other side has just conceded the debate, if it’s wrong to prostitute someone who was a child when they entered prostitution, then what we know, and there’s no argument about these numbers, is that in the vicinity of 75 to 85 or 90 percent of everyone in prostitution, entered prostitution as a legal minor, oftentimes, a 13- or 14-year-old. That’s a fact. One of the things— One of the things— CATHARINE MacKINNON — research is done. One of the things— they don’t have a problem. don’t think it’s accurate to say that we haven’t heard from these high-end call girls, we have heard from them. For example in your book, Ms. Barrows, you talked about Claudette, she’s the most empowered call girl, right, and she herself said this kind of work can be very taxing both physically and emotionally. “I’ve never met a man who can really understand what it takes out of you.” And I think that even the most supposedly empowered call girls when they are interviewed, do say thing— say things like this— No, but— I think that—",2.0
against,"You’re using my time. Basically—I’ll have to repeat I’m afraid what I already said which is that, we have taken a subset of human behavior which we all disagree with and despise, which is coercive, which is as the speaker just before mentioned is covered by painfully wrought criminal law and so on, and we’ve turned that into a metaphor, and then a description of the common human experience that we all have of men and women or men and men or women and women together. And somehow, in the description we lose the generosity of spirit, the sense of adventure, the intensity, and, let us not forget, and not mentioning primates again, but sex is about human evolution, it’s about reproduction, it’s the most important thing any species has to attend to. And it would be a great surprise, if it were not confounded by glitches, sometimes tragic ones, it would be a great surprise if everyone was in agreement about it. We have, talking about prostitution, Indian girls are betrothed at the age of four to a guy who’s five and they are married, but they obviously can’t perform as married couples until they reach a certain age. The Kama Sutra, that famous book that nobody’s ever been able to succeed in emulating, was given to the new couple when they finally were married so they could practice this great craft of sex. I’m, all I want to protect here, is the notion that sex is not a disease, that sexual interaction is not necessarily an expletive, exploitative phenomenon, that it has its own legitimacy, its own agenda, and it will and has continued, in much the same way and a sensible society will try to make it better— —not to criminalize it—",3.0
for,"Thank you, I certainly agree that sex is not a disease, so I’m glad we can , perhaps all agree on that… Look, nobody has addressed my point that, no one asks the ages of the girls, when they pay for sex, and that is the link between the trafficking of children, as well, and, so you wanna, I think, consider that, that’s something that nobody has addressed and it makes those paying for sex responsible. Look, I think…since the 1960s, we’ve been beholden to this false dichotomy that, you know, you’re either a repressed person who has no feelings, or the prudes, or you’re the liberated who goes around with everyone, and treats sex casually and I don’t think this dichotomy really captures the experience of most women or most men for that matter. And I think we need to revive the idea of higher standards for both sexes. And, that sex is a good thing, but we don’t have to take advantage of the most vulnerable in our society when we choose our sexual partners. The devaluing of women and children’s innocence that happens in a society that makes sex into a commodity, to validate that, and to declare that paying for sex is perfectly fine, is to say something about society’s relationship to women and especially girls that I think would be detrimental. But also to men. You’ve—yes, we’ve all read that Times article about sugar daddies, but to me what was so touching was the man who went on the website, and he just gave the girl a monthly stipend for her education. And he refused to have sex with her and this is what the debate is about, it’s about who we want to be. And who knows the far-reaching consequences of that, that he went on this somewhat depressing website, but he was capable of such greatness and saying no, you know what, I’m not going to pay for sex. And, if you think that what the man did didn’t matter, that he supported her education without even meeting her, and you think he could’ve just as easily paid for sex, and that would’ve been the same choice morally then vote for the negative team, but if you can see the beauty in that choice, which he made in the privacy of his own home, and not in any courtroom, then, vote for the proposition— —because we’re not a monkey, men are not monkeys and women— —women are not chicken. Thank you.",3.0
against,"Rather than repeat my major points, I’d like to focus on one small answer. The issue came up, what if a man is a quadriplegic, and wants to buy sex. The opposition still hasn’t answered this question, in my opinion, their responses were, to put it bluntly, lame. Women will come around, let’s teach women disability should not be a problem, that’s fine, no one will disagree with that. But what about, dot, dot, dot. There simply was no answer. The other side would’ve been much better simply saying look, that’s an exception to the principle, in that case it’s fine. But they cannot bring themselves to give that humane answer. I think when push comes to shove, there’s something about the notion of informed, consenting adults, which is what’s at stake here…making an exchange that they simply do not like. If you’re in any doubt, just consider different parts of the world, and where they would line up in this debate. The notion that there are real abuses, but that buying sex is something that we should tolerate, is extremely common in western Europe. The kinds of arguments you’re hearing on the other side. If you look at the debates over prostitution in the country of Iran, you hear exactly, and I mean exactly the same arguments in Iran, that you have heard from the people on the other side of this debate. If you look at what some aspects of what the religious right push for, the arguments they make, it is very similar to what you have heard on the other side of this debate. If you’re in any doubt, ask yourself, in which set of societies with which set of attitudes would you rather live. Western Europe, or the kinds of places and cultures, where the attitude toward prostitution is that which you find to my right. Think about that, and then please vote accordingly. Thank you.",3.0
for,"think it’s wrong to pay for sex, there’s no mutuality of sexual pleasure or any other kind of power in prostitution, where one person has the social, legal, and economic power to buy another person, and to use them as a sexualized puppet. By the way one of the kinds of damages we haven’t talked about today, is the damage to women’s sexuality after being in prostitution for a long time. They usually are not capable of any kind of sexual intimacy, that reflects the years of selling that act in prostitution. They say, that’s stolen from them. Men who are sold in prostitution experience exactly the same kinds of damage to their sexuality, and the similar symptoms of traumatic stress. Maybe the primates we should take a lesson from, are the bonobos, who, when female bonobos are co-dominant, males are less aggressive and females are more sexual. There’s a lot of sexuality in bonobo society, everyone’s having sex. But it’s used for mutual pleasure, it’s used to cement social bonds. And by the way the first time a male—adolescent male gets sexually aggressive, the female elder bonobos get together and kick his ass. He— He learns from that one experience that that’s not what sex is. So, one other comment about legalization of prostitution, it really is a failed experiment, the same numbers of women in legal prostitution in Nevada want to escape it, the same numbers are homeless, as in other kinds of prostitution. The institution of prostitution is built on the exploitation and abuse of women, it can’t be fixed, only abolished. I’m relentlessly optimistic about men’s capacity for change. It’s wrong to buy sex. Is it bone-a-bos or bon-a-bos. Bonobos, .",3.0
