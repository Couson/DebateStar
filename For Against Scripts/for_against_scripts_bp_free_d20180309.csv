for,"Well, I will not divulge his name, but the secret is a good bottle of single-malt Scotch. Works every time. It did."
against,"Yes, I did. It was not a purpose of my travel -- -- I’m sorry to say. That’s right. I earn it -- It is a confidence that problems can be solved, that people make choices and choices make history instead of a deterministic conclusion of that question. I always wear it."
for,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Before you get boisterous, because John told you to be, I should tell you that Frank and I will sound a little bit like Grinch at a Christmas dinner. And the reason for that is who wants to hear, after all, that humanitarian war does more harm than good? This is a project that saves lives, that ends atrocities, and invokes universal human rights. It is an idea that should unify the world. Alas, it has divided it and divided it deeply on fundamental issues. Who has the right to intervene? Under what circumstances? With what objective? To stop atrocities, and end there, or to then overthrow the regime -- as happened in Libya -- or to stop atrocities and midwife the birth of a new state -- as happened in Kosovo? These issues have not been resolved. Now, critics of humanitarian intervention worry about something else, and that is, ""Will this ostensibly universal principle be applied universally in practice or bent and twisted by the powerful and applied selectively?"" They're -- they have good reason to be worried. If you are a great power -- the United States, China, Russia -- you do not have to fear intervention directed against you no matter what you do. Consider Russia and Chechnya in '94. If you are a middle power -- India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt -- you don't have to worry about intervention either, because you've got the military muscle to make an intervention costly. So, who does that leave? A miserable gaggle of friendless, isolated states. They, ladies and gentlemen, will be on the receiving end of this universal principle. I'll give you some examples. Saudi Arabia today is waging a ruinous and vicious war in Yemen. Let's put the strategic issues aside. Hundreds of people have died in air strikes by the Saudis. They have put down a blockade that has contributed to a cholera epidemic that has afflicted 1 million people -- 1 million. 10 million people are on the brink of starvation. Have you heard anyone -- even from the humanitarian intervention camp -- calling for penalties against Saudi Arabia?  They're arming the Saudis. And as we speak, the crown prince is being received by Her Majesty's government. Let's look at another example.  The government of Myanmar has killed 7,000 Rohingya, and the toll is amounting, and chased 600 others out of their homes. Do you think the government of Myanmar is worried about the hoofbeats of humanitarian intervention, the generals lie in bed worrying? Not at all, because they have China in their corner. Now, I wanted to speak about another problem that humanitarian intervention faces, and that is the law not just of unintended consequences, but uncontrollable consequences -- uncontrollable consequences. Only one example because the clock is ticking. And that is Libya. Libya post-intervention is a violent, anarchic mess -- two governments, a multitude of militias, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, with chapters newly created in Libya. The entire neighborhood is threatened. Tens of thousands of refugees -- tens of thousands of refugees have fled across the Mediterranean, pumping up the power of right-wing populist parties in Europe. Look at what is happening in Europe today. Now, I want to finish with Bosnia and Kosovo -- that I haven't talked about. They teach us one lesson. If you want even a modicum of stability post-intervention, you have to keep tens of thousands of troops on the ground, spend billions of dollars to do it right. I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the body politic of the West, and certainly the United States, there isn’t the political support to do it. Now, are the paragons of humanitarian intervention worried about this? Not at all! They have overweening confidence in their idea. That overweening confidence, ladies and gentlemen, slides sometimes into hubris, and that is yet another reason why this project, this noble project, does more harm than good. "
against," Does humanitarian intervention do more harm than good? Not at all. You were talking, and this is a big mistake, about military intervention, not humanitarian. It doesn’t mean anything in humanitarian intervention. Let me give you some examples. The first one. Yes, sir, you were talking about Rwanda, April ’94. Sorry to say, I was there during all the genocide with my people, doctors and medical staff, and we did a lot. Compared to the genocide -- compared to, let’s say, 800,000 of dead people massacred, it was nothing, but believe me, humanitarian intervention is not a problem of numbers of dead, of victims. If you can save one, and if it is your daughter or your sister or your father, this is a very important one. Humanitarian means human being. Human being; you have to count one after one. So, it’s not a question of military intervention. You were right in some of your examples. But we were before in Kosovo; we were before the humanitarian people, working with the people, not with the government. There was no government; it was the Serbian government. So, this is easy to counterattack all your examples. Afghanistan; we were since 20 years working with the people, and there is still an hospital in Kabul, bombed every day, with explosions every day in Kabul. But the French hospital is still working without the government’s help at all. So, humanitarian intervention is not a military intervention. Neutrality is the rule. When we were working in Lebanon, we were working on Christian side, and on Muslims’ side, and on Shi’ite’s side, Sunni’s side, et cetera. We -- there is no choice for a medical doctor or a humanitarian doctor. You don’t have to -- the good deaths and the bad deaths; the good victim and the bad victim. Not at all.  So, we did. And the neutrality is absolutely necessary. And don’t mix up military -- sometimes military intervention to protect -- to protect -- some particular project is good, but usually we are not, and we are never asking about military intervention. Don’t mix up. And I can give you a lot of examples. You were talking about Mali. Mali; the humanitarian French involvement -- but French doesn’t matter -- international involvement was very -- I mean , it was . The people were a necessity who is calling . In humanitarian intervention, you have to understand that somebody was calling, some victim, some group of victims, or a nation. We are not just, let’s say, choosing our victims and choosing our nation. Not at all. Rohingya is a good example. We were there, not enough to alert the people, and I agree with your example. It was necessary to intervene, and I asked my government. Unfortunately, I was not in charge of the government at the beginning. And of course, it’s a good example. We had to. Humanitarian intervention has to be before, close to the victims after a victim’s call, but not because the government or the military people are asking us.  This is a neutral intervention, and this is, according to my opinion, the proudness of human beings, and the proudness of the international community. If we are stepping back, and if I understand your slogan, we have to stop the humanitarian intervention and development intervention, and everything, and wait for the -- so, we have to let them die. I don't accept that."
for,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's simply not good enough to reframe this debate as humanitarian intervention. For those of us who have been involved in these failed efforts over the last 20 years, the predominant effort has been brutally militarily -- military and bloody. Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you down to Basra, to Iraq in 2004, command group meeting . Middle of the night. The general showed up. It was a pep talk. Things weren't going so well. And the general said, ""Guys, I want you to be aware of one thing, and here's what I want you to be aware of. We are the biggest and best gang in the province, and don't you forget it."" And ladies and gentlemen, that was true. There were 7-and-a-half thousand of us heavily armed, well-trained, well-equipped, and with a reasonably clear idea of our vision and our mission, which was to secure 1-and-a-half million people. We failed to do that. We ended up hunkered down in a military base, defeated, after some months. Cut now to Bosnia, the poster child for real humanitarian intervention. I was in that mission too. 60,000 of us there were, four armed divisions. We had complete military dominance across the spectrum. No one would touch us. But ladies and gentlemen, that was in a country of four million people. Kosovo, very similar. We had complete dominance. What I would like to hear from our opponents tonight is where we are going to get 60,000 troops to secure a relative -- even a relatively small country not so far away, let alone one of the invadables that Rajan was talking about, which are likely to be much further away. And the kind of war involved in -- let's be brutally frank about that. Non-international armed conflicts, internal strife, call it what you will -- civil wars. And they are the most brutal, complex, and difficult operations that can be conceived. You are involved, when you're in operations such as that, in a three-dimensional chess match in the dark, against multiple adversaries who tomorrow may be your allies -- others, your allies today, may be your adversaries or your enemies tomorrow. Against a background where, if you are not absolutely certain of where your objectives lie, ladies and gentlemen, you have no business in being in such an environment unless you're absolutely sure that you can secure yourselves and the people you are there to protect. And nowadays, the will, the means, the material, are no longer present within our polities, within our governments. We simply do not have the resources any longer to be able to sustain this kind of complex, deeply, deeply difficult operation. And now I turn, possibly, to the most important aspect, and one which I think most of you will be intimately familiar -- with which most of you will be intimately familiar, the politics of all this. Because, let's be frank, who is going to be doing these interventions? Is Britain going to do it? Britain ran out of bombs after a couple of weeks in Libya. Is France going to do it?  In all of the missions that we have sustained over the last 15 or 20 years, the United States have borne between 60 and 90 percent of the effort. Do you detect in the United States any political will for long, bloody, indeterminate poorly planned operations at the ends of the earth? Even if you assume there is some objective to them? Now, one of the themes of this conference is an increasing sense, I think, of insecurity in Europe. This is a final question I want to put to you. Is this what our armed forces should be doing at a time when, sooner or later, they may be -- our defense forces -- required to fulfill their advertised function of defense? I'm going to leave you with a thought. Just before I came here, I spoke to a friend of mine, one of my young officers in Iraq, badly injured, and I said I was coming to talk on humanitarian intervention. He said, “Well, there’s a contradiction in terms for you. It’s war.” And he's quite right. No matter how you dress it up, when you conduct this kind of intervention you are fighting a war. And there’s one thing the last 20 years have taught us. It’s that you don't control war; it controls you. Ladies and gentlemen, support the motion. "
against,"So, Bernard and my opponents in this argument make a number of good points, but they conflate warfare and humanitarian intervention in a way that I think -- Thank you for that . In a way that I think confuses the subject some. Iraq and Afghanistan aren’t humanitarian interventions. They’re wars. We fought them for a reason, and that reason wasn't protecting the people of Iraq or Afghanistan. The reason was protecting the people of the United States and Britain and other -- and whatever you think about those wars, you should not -- and the fact that we had humanitarian components to them, as, I think, Western powers ought always to have in their warfare, that doesn't make them humanitarian interventions. Humanitarian interventions are not always conducted by the military, although very often they need a military component in order to make them successful. And the reason that is, is because humanitarian crises aren't natural disasters. They're not earthquakes; they're not acts of God. They're acts of political malevolence. That’s why -- that’s why violence is used for political purpose. That's what causes humanitarian crises. It's not a famine. It's an act of political violence by a government or another political actor. When that happens, that means a society is broken in some important way. So, I think we ought not to set the standard that humanitarian interventions very often fail to solve the underlying political problems, that they very often have unintended consequences, that they very often are complicated and get bogged down, and you lose your focus. The undertaking is intrinsically extraordinarily difficult. It's a society in transition, where political violence -- where violence is being used for political purposes in order to gain political outcomes. But that doesn't mean they never work. So, even if you don't buy Bernard's impassioned appeal that even one life deserves defending, there are practical, hard-edged policy reasons to engage in humanitarian interventions, and I will just offer two to you. One is that humanitarian interventions are often -- humanitarian crises are often the prelude of worst humanitarian crises, and there the example is Syria, where if we, external actors, had taken action in 2012 or 2013, you would not -- you may have seen a bad outcome, but it is unlikely to be worse than half a million dead Syrians, 11 million people refugees. the tottering of the surrounding governments of Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and the fracturing of political dialogue in those countries as a result of the pressure that the violent collapse of Syria brought about. So -- Thank you. So, it -- it's not true that doing nothing should leave us with a clear conscience. It's also not true that doing nothing has no strategic consequences. Russia's return to a power broker role in the Middle East, for example, is a direct consequence of us not intervening in the terrible humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. So, humanitarian interventions are seeking to address a political crisis that has resulted in violence in societies. It's difficult to get it right. We very often get it wrong. But sometimes we get it right. I would argue that Kosovo is a success story. Did it require military force? Yes, it did. But did it also prevent Slobodan Milosevic and Serbs from doing a terrible, brutal injustice to people who were ostensibly citizens of their country?  That's a great outcome. We ought to celebrate that. And I think it is a mistake to believe you can -- that we can exist in innocence and purity in our own societies in our values. And this I learned from Randy Shinavan and the McCain campaign in 2008. You strengthen our values at their ragged edges. People don't make brave choices when they are in danger. You need to stand next to them and help them make good choices.  Yes, and yes. It would have made a difference then because it would have helped adjudicate the divisive, difficult political debate internal to Syria. It would have restrained the ability of the Syrian government to use brutality as a weapon of political control. It -- the fact that we have done it poorly, in some instances, doesn't mean we haven't also done it well. Sierra Leone is a great example, where the British government engineered an intervention."
for,"Well, I sense headwinds from the audience, but I think it would have been complete madness to intervene in Syria. I hold no grief for the blood-drenched Assad regime. But here's what happened. A peaceful demonstration was set upon by a savage government. Very quickly, the operation -- the opposition was radicalized. And within a matter of months, the groups with -- -- on the ground were either Islamists or people who wanted to create a Salafi state in Syria; Arar Al-Sham ; Jaysh Al-Islam; Jabat Al-Nusra. Now, if you send -- -- weapons into a society where alliances are shifting, borders are shifting, corruption is existing. Do you have any guarantee that the weapons are going to go to the good guys? And who are the good guys as time rolls along? Look, let's not have a competition for compassion and tragedy here. That's not what this is about, whether Frank and I care about dying people. Of course, we do. The question is, how do you make a very difficult decision that balancing -- -- ethics and strategy?"
against," Another time we're talking about military intervention. You are right, the first scene of massacres was --"
for,You should be on this side.
against,"No, no, on the contrary. You should be thinking about what I’m going to say."
for,"Oh, I am."
against,"This is my idea, not a humanitarian intervention. We were in Syria. My people, the Medecins Sans Frontieres and Medecins Du Monde. They were already there, and we take -- we took care of the wounded people. Because you are starting the story with the massacre of the army, Bashar al-Assad army, fighting on the crowd. But formerly we were there, and we are still there, but this is so difficult and risky. Don't ask the humanitarian people to be heroes and to want to -- to -- to sacrifice their life. Sometimes they are talking to -- about their families, thinking about their family. But we were there. Don’t mix another time . I’m not responsible -- But we were -- -- don’t believe that humanitarian -- sir, please. We are not responsible of the direction of the army. We are not responsible of the setting up -- -- -- Can I take a swing at it?  We are a humanitarian people. We are not a nation. But this is not, absolutely not, the problem.  May I take a swing at this? Me too. Me too. We are talking about -- No, sir, no, sir -- We are talking about -- -- -- humanitarian involvement. She’s talking also -- -- not about the nation and the army.  So, it seems to me that you are suggesting that any use of military force has to be an enormous use of military force, or that anything else would have failed. Windows of opportunity open and close with time. And if, for example -- in the specific case of Syria, if, for example, we had taken away the government's ability to use air power, that would have leveled the playing field and possibly prevented the radicalization of rebels that you subsequently saw."
for,"Kori -- Absolutely. I'm very keen to get stuck in here, because I can't let this pass. First of all, when you just take out a nation's air power, you don't do that; you make war on the state, and the Syrian air defense system is probably the strongest outside the Western world other than Russia. That would have been an extremely difficult undertaking, an act of war. And you might agree with me when I were to say -- if I were to say that perhaps Russia might have had something to say about that, given that they essentially run Syria’s air defense system and much of its defenses. And also, Iran, who have-- both whose nations, whether we like it or not, have serious interests in the region. No, the “would have, could have, should have” argument doesn't work, because what, in my view, would have happened is we wouldn't have had green, white, red flags in Damascus. We’d have had black flags in Damascus had we intervened with the 82nd Airborne Brigade -- Exactly my point, John. I don’t believe in “would have, could have, should have.”"
against,"So, can I -- Yes, please. But who is able to give the clearance to the humanitarian involvement? To whom do we have to address our question? Are we supposed to follow a government? We are not following a government. We are just answering to the victims’ call. So, when the victims are in Syria, we tried, and sometimes we succeeded in sending, let’s say -- this is -- of course, this is surgery for them, because unfortunately it was not something else. So, when it is starvation or the welcome of the refugees, also the humanitarian involvement is necessary, and we don't have to give to call for reformation . So, there is a sort of vocation -- one by one -- without any -- Of course, yes."
for,"John, we're not going to work. Generally speaking, it does more harm than good -- That's our piece."
against,"Of course, yes."
for,"John, may I -- Look, I have great admiration for Mr. Kouchner. He is a towering figure on the world stage and a true humanitarian.  But let me ask you this -- and this does not apply to -- there's a but coming, but not yet, yeah? But let me ask you this. If there's so much compassion in the West for suffering people, why haven't we done something that's much easier than taking out the Syrian air defense system or sending arms into Syria? Why is the World Food Programme and the UNHCR going around with a begging bowl, because rich countries have not provided -- but they promised -- Mr. Kouchner -- Now, one other thing. One other thing. I had a very clever debating teacher. She was brilliant. And she told me, ""If you don't win the argument, reframe the debate."" Mr. Kouchner is talking about aid, relief, mediation -- All this. No one disagrees with that. It's the sharp end of the stick that has made this debate so controversial.  Because we've seen it used, and often with cataclysmic consequences. And on the point that Iraq was not a humanitarian intervention -- when they didn't find WMD, what if the some of the humanitarian interventionists -- not Mr. Kouchner -- Tony Blair and all those say, ""Well, we got rid of the dictator."" You got rid of the dictator and turned the Middle East upside down. That's what you did."
against,"No, but -- I'm sorry -- This is a big misunderstanding -- a big misunderstanding."
for,Please enlighten me.
against,"You are not talking about humanitarian intervention. You are talking about military -- and sometimes with humanitarian, sometimes without. This is not -- this is your problem -- but this is not the problem of the people defending and offering to suffering to heal the victims. This is not the same situation. So, my favorite reflection on the war weariness of the American public actually comes from the satirical newspaper The Onion, which argues that the nation's college professors are weary of the burden they're carrying of our wars, right? Because the nation's college professors aren't carrying the burdens of our wars. And in fact, the American public hasn't objected to the -- this president of the United States, with his America First doctrine, from increasing troops fighting in Afghanistan, from increasing troops fighting in Iraq -- -- from increasing troops fighting in Syria, from increasing troops fighting in the Sahel . Those are not all humanitarian interventions. But if the American public were so weary of the burden of war, the president would be saying some political price for that. And in fact, what you see is the reverse, right?"
for,"John, John --"
against,-- gets drawn out into the world by the expressions of our values.
for,"John -- Whether President Trump never sends another soldier abroad, the United States are in hock for $5.6 trillion for what's gone on over the last 16 years. That's the cost, never mind the 6,000 dead soldiers, 60,000 injured soldiers, and all the other political costs. You're in hock for that already. And I would suggest to you that there's very little appetite for another dollar being spent on that kind of intervention. Ladies and gentlemen, when all else fails, attack professors. If only -- if only we had the influence that Kori thinks we have. Look, I'm not talking about university professors. Who cares about them? I'm one. I'm negligible. I spend a fair amount of time with military people. You know how I started doing it? I worked for two years on the New York City suicide hotline and talked to our troops who’d come back. All we do is tie yellow ribbons around trees and wave the flags. They come back maimed, with PTSD, and I’ve talked to them exactly about this. So, please don't tell me that I'm sitting in an ivory tower. I have friends who have served there, and I can tell you when you leave this echo chamber called Washington D.C. and go to Missouri or Oregon or Texas, there is no stomach for this. And, ladies and gentlemen, don't take my word for it: Pew has done very good polling on this. When you tell people that the cost rises in blood and treasure, support falls off. Look it up."
against,"To answer precisely to your question, yes. But it's too late. Unfortunately, we are witness in Earth's and not protesting at all to the fall and the death of La Ghouta, close to Damascus. Are we supposed to send people? Yes, we tried, but it's impossible to pass the troops, to pass through, et cetera. But you were asking about Kurds. We didn't ask the President Hollande or the President Macron or the former President Sarkozy to help the Kurdish people. We did. We are not asking any power, any elected power. We are just doing it, and in Afghanistan this is obvious. I mean, humanitarian involvement in of the involvement of the American people. But nine September, yes. And the people -- the terrorist people -- you had to react, but it was absolutely without any link with the humanitarian intervention. We were since 15 years in charge of some region, , of Afghanistan, and we are close to the people. We are not just asking about our soldiers’ involvement or your soldiers’ involvement or any soldiers’ involvement. It certainly is true that the decisions that the United States and other intervening powers in Iraq made -- both the decision to invade Iraq and then the decision to leave Iraq in 2011 facilitated the rise of ISIS. There's no question about that. But it's also a lesson about what solves these problems, right? Because the -- if you think about the Iraq case, if the United -- when the United States and other countries cared about good governance, helped establish an environment where Iraqis felt secure, they were beginning to make brave political choices in the parliamentary elections in 2010, for example, all the major slates for cross-sectarian. So, you can see how this works, when it works. But you can also see how it fails with --"
for,This is Potemkin Village stuff.
against,"-- too little local knowledge, with too much hubris, with too little commitment, with too little caring about solving the underlying political problems is how these fail. So, I think that's a terrible and a tragic example -- Well -- -- of where things can go wrong. But the fact that things can go wrong, and bad things happen doesn't mean they always happen. It doesn't mean good things don't -- aren't also -- it seems to me that humanitarian intervention merits -- Is necessary. -- doing -- is necessary. That's not an argument for doing it badly. It's an argument to improve your knowledge, especially your local knowledge, to prevent mistakes like that from tarnishing the good that needs to be done."
for," I just want to speak to you for a second. You've spoken with great eloquence and compassion, and I respect your knowledge. You've identified the problem, but you haven't elucidated the solutions. Now, on the business of people are learning, making proper choices, democracy, corruption -- we have heard this for 15 years. There are serious problems in my country with infrastructure, poverty, income inequality. The out-year costs of these two campaigns -- that are unwinnable, by the way -- is $5 trillion, all right? And we want to have more of this? It's not feasible. There are many problems in the world that admit no solution. There are many more problems, ladies and gentlemen, that admit of no American solution. It is a tragic world. Nobody wants people to die here. That's not what we're arguing. It is, what is feasible, given the constraints, given what people are prepared to support at home, given the risks of intervention -- which are considerable and have been sanitized by the other side. That's the issue. We're not having an arms race on compassion here."
against,"I'm -- I'm disparate , yes."
for," Yeah, I'd like to -- I'd like to -- I’d like to address that directly. It's not our case that humanitarian -- military -- military -- humanitarian intervention is always going to cause more harm than good. It can cause good if it's well-planned, limited in duration, and strategic in nature. Yazidis is one example. However, I'd also point out to you that four million Iraqis, Iraqi Christians, are now outside their own country. They were not protected, and very many other minorities within that country. So, this was a very narrow, very limited intervention, and as a result, successful. The same applies, too, to some degree, by the way, as you said earlier, Kori, to the Sierra -- Sierra Leone intervention in ’99. Extremely limited, extremely to the point, and very, very short. No, -- I wonder if you could name -- Kori can name one intervention in the last 20 years which was, by the way, an off-the-books action by a British general that was not authorized by his government -- a rather brave action by General Richards. That’s the only example you can point to, plus the aid drop, because that’s what it was. There was very little military involvement other than that to the Yazidis a couple of years ago. And that’s it."
against,"I think the intervention in East Timor led by Australia -- Yes, and in Kosovo. -- counts as a success. I think Kosovo --"
for,UN-authorized.
against,"-- counts as a success. I think the 1991 protection of what we now come to think about as the Kurdish territory -- -- of northern Iraq, which was not a narrow or limited intervention, was an enormous success."
for,Only if she can explain what she -- I’m not quite -- it’s not your fault. I'm not understanding your question. What do you mean when there's no --
against,"Yeah -- These aren’t natural -- -- disasters. They’re political problems, and they of course require political solutions that -- that sometimes military force is a necessary component of. Very always other tools are also necessary."
for,"Well, we might consider some political solutions, as you suggested. I was talking to a NATO official a couple of months ago concerning Syria, and I asked whether or not we might consider -- and this is political; it’s more financial -- what -- instead of sending our troops, American troops, British troops, European troops, to somewhere like Syria, we might consider, oh, I don't know, targeting some oligarchs in London and making sure that they have, for example, immigration problems. And the senior NATO official said, ""Yeah, you know what?"" ""I put that to my chiefs, and it was rejected.” This is not the kind of solution that is -- was felt to be appropriate. Instead, we devolve immediately to military solutions."
against,"I already told you that we are mixing up everything. But I'm going to answer, about migrants. In -- They are dying in the Mediterranean Sea by the thousands. Two French boats or three French boats are in charge of rescuing them themselves. We didn't ask the government. One is Mete St. Frontiere , the other is Mete St. Douvan . This is a humanitarian intervention and not a military intervention. And we have a lot like that. Starvation, disease, ebola. Who is the first -- at the first rank to intervene? Humanitarian people. Do you want to suppress that or not? This is not always a question of war and peace. This is a question of human being and answering to suffering. That's all."
for,"If this were a debate about mediation, providing relief to refugees, and so on, there would be no debate. Frank and I agree with this. What has made the project of humanitarian intervention controversial is the military dimension. Now, I take fully -- I take fully -- now, hang on -- I take fully -- -- Mr. Kouchner's point that there are other forms of it. But we are talking about the most pernicious forms. Now, can I quickly respond to a point that Kori made? I'll be very fast, very fast. East Timor and Kosovo. Here's the thing. The intervention in East Timor was possible because the TNI , the Indonesian Military, agreed to stand down and not resist. Had they not, it would not have happened. In Kosovo, NATO pilots were restricted to flying no lower than 20,000 feet, even though the Serbs scaled up with the killing. This goes to my point that the capacity to really suffer and die on behalf of these missions, ladies and gentlemen, is limited. That is a political question, not just a military question. Two minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, if you were to visit my study at home, you would see bookshelves groaning with books on humanitarian intervention. And I want to tell you a personal story. I started out on this side of the debate partly from reading about the incredible work that people like Mr. Kouchner do. I had enormous sympathy for the intervention in Bosnia. I do not want people to die; that's not what this is about. It was a long, and difficult, and painful road to me -- for me to come to where I am coming. We have to, in this tragic world -- read Max Weber or Thucydides -- filter moral issues through difficult circumstances. We may have people who are being put under enormous distress and would like to do something. But a president has to -- or a prime minister -- this goes to you, ma'am -- has to put an enormous amount of attention on the political realities and the military risk. You've been a very energetic crowd, and I sensed where the momentum of the crowd is. But please don't misunderstand us. We don't take any joy in arguing the position. It is not the idea that humanitarian intervention is always bad -- as witness the gentleman's question on the Yazidis. I think that was a good move. I supported it. The proposition is not whether it is always bad. That's not what we're arguing here. "
against,"Let me say that your sentence is not good. You have to write ""Humanitarian bar and military intervention does more harm than good.” It will be better, and it will be more close to, let's say, the question you're asking. This is not a humanitarian intervention but humanitarian and military under military umbrella. It will be better, because you were never talking about humanitarian; that is to say, volunteers not guided by government people close to the others. Second, of course, you go to some of the point where it was necessary to intervene, but it was impossible to have intervene everywhere, because a state and an army -- especially American army or the British army or the French army are not bad. But humanitarian people are completely a little group, a few people under their own decision, under their own charter. This is not because we were asking, as I told you, the approval or the clearance from any government. So, do you want to suppress that? Certainly not. You don't want to suppress the military intervention with humanitarian, but do you want to suppress the only unique humanitarian ? I don't think so. Do you want to suppress the way we were thinking about Ebola ? No, certainly not. So, it's always the case we are, let’s say, answering the maximum or the minimum what we were able to answer to human suffering. It was a progress compared to the Second World War. We did something against barbarian people, against the nature of, let’s say, the oppression. Do you want to suppress that? I don't think so."
for,"Ladies and gentlemen, in such dangerous things as war, the errors which proceed from a spirit of benevolence are the worst class. Von Clausewitz, the famous Prussian general and theorist, said that just under 200 years ago, and it holds as much today -- holds as much water today as it did then. The disasters and catastrophes, the wreckage of which we're dealing with now, over -- over the last 15 years should give anyone pause before any kind of military intervention is considered. But there are times, aren’t there? And it's not our case on this side of the house that humanitarian intervention can never work, only that, generally speaking, it does more harm than good, and one major example of that was revealed by Bernard himself in his last but one speech, and that’s Libya. And Bernard doesn't need reminding, and nor do you, as to why it is that all those thousands of refugees and migrants are dying in the Mediterranean. That's because of the appalling mess we've made of Libya. I include myself in that. There are times, ladies and gentlemen, when we're tempted to do great and good things. Let me give you an analogy. We can say on the top of a mountain that there are people in desperate need of help. We know we should do something. We know something must be done, but we also know that if we go on that mountain to rescue them, we don't have the kit, we don't have the oxygen we don't have the resources to help them. We should do something, but we can't. Ladies and gentlemen, I was in Beirut a couple of years ago, and I met a young lady very similar to the young Syrian woman who spoke before. And I was there, rather pompously, to find out what Britain could do to ameliorate the situation there. I'll never -- never forget her response when she found out that I'd already been involved in several of these failed interventions. She said, “Haven't you done enough?” Thanks very much, ladies and gentlemen. Support the motion. Think about it in a different way. I think I was very moved by Mr. Kouchner's eloquent statement about how much good can be done without the military dimension. I think he's absolutely right on that. I think Kori is correct that carefully planned and executed, under certain circumstances -- those circumstances, I think, are rare -- humanitarian intervention can work. We have never argued the proposition that it cannot work. These are two formidable intellectuals. I have enjoyed debating them. Thank you both."
against,"The Libya case, I think, is an incredibly strong case for the opposition's side of the argument, where we unquestionably made a terrible -- -- situation worse by our half-hearted and incremental meddling in it. In the extreme moment -- that is, when the decision was made to do something -- I think the overwhelming sense in the west that disaster was imminent might not have been correct. And I think you can make that case even more strongly than perhaps we did. But I thought you guys played a difficult hand, especially with an audience of -- like this kind, that cares about creating positive change. I think you made a difficult case extraordinarily well."
for,"That was my mother. No, I see it -- I see it honestly going downhill.  I think that unipolar moment’s passed, and there’s too many -- simply too many military tensions to justify it."
against,"You know, I devoted my life to humanitarian intervention. I think, according to your position, I was wrong, but I don't regret anything, because I'm talking to the victim. Second point; don't accuse the vaccination to be responsible of epidemics and pandemics. Don't accuse the anti- tuberculosis to be responsible of tuberculosis. Humanitarian intervention is not responsible. It does good -- let’s say, provoke success sometimes, and never harm against the people. Never, never, never, never, never."
