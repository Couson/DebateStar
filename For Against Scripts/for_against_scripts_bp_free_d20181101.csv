for," I want to thank you all for coming tonight for this very serious discussion. There is nothing that funny people love more than being extremely unfunny about what we do. Seriously, we’re the most self-important people here in the world. And I’m here to say that Trump is bad for comedy. My partner, PJ, will go into sort of more of the politics of it. I’m going to talk to you about my real-world experience, and I want to preface this by saying I’m talking about the conditions for comedy. Trump is terrible for the conditions for comedy. I’ve experienced this firsthand in comedy clubs across this country. Now, as you probably have already realized, I’m not very famous, and I don’t -- I don’t have a huge fanbase. I probably have maybe one fan in here tonight. Thank you, Dad, for coming. No, I don’t have a huge fan base, so the people that come to my shows are random. I don’t know who’s going to be in there, and I have no control over it. God, I wish I did. I knew something was awry when, in 2016, I did a show in a club in Atlanta, Georgia, and I said two words. I said, “Hillary Clinton,” and I hadn’t said anything about her yet, but a man in the front row went like this, “.” That’s when I knew something was wrong. He didn’t even know how I felt about it yet, and he was already having a visceral reaction. Since the election, I’ve noticed a very palpable change in the environment in stand-up clubs. As a comedian, I have kind of a sixth sense; I can detect tight buttholes in a room. I can feel them. There are a few in here tonight, and I just encourage you -- -- to loosen just a little. We are debating comedy. And I’ve called these past couple of years the Great Butthole Tightening. When I go into a club, I think Trump has made us all very tense. He has divided us down to a familial level. People had blocked their family members on Facebook; people have cut family members out of their lives. They’ve now found out that coworkers of theirs are now mortal enemies, you know, or neighbors. Everything is now divided, and it’s very tense, and it’s actually pretty painful. So, when they come to a club, and I tell a joke about Trump, the people that laugh are on one side, and the people that don’t laugh are on the other, and now people are scared that a civil war is literally going to break out in the club. That’s not a good condition for comedy. So, either my audience is divided, or they don’t want to hear about politics anymore, because they’re just sick of it. There’s a fatigue of it at this point. Or they’re on the other side, which is they want me to go off about politics; they want me to go off about Trump, but they don’t even want me to be funny. They just want me to scream; also, not a good condition for comedy. There’s this thing called “clap-ter.” It’s something that comedians are falling prey to right now. It’s very tempting. Clap-ter is when you make a really good point, and everyone claps, but they’re not laughing, because what you said wasn’t funny. It was just something that you believe. I’ve seen many of my fellow comedians fall ill to this scourge. Again, not a good condition for comedy when you’re being tempted -- Thank you, sir.  It’s tempting. The other part of this is truth is part of comedy. We like to hold up a mirror to society; we like to show universal truth that unites the audience, but now we can’t agree on what truth is anymore. It’s hard to know what’s real, and it’s hard to describe and make fun of the shape of the world when a huge portion of your audience literally believes that it’s flat. That’s a problem.  Another things about comedians is that we’re supposed to be fearless. We’re supposed to go up on stage and not have any fear and just take the laughs. But now, I’ve found that I and many of my fellow comedians are actually afraid, and part of that is because online we get harassed a lot. I get -- you know, if I say anything political --- sometimes it doesn’t have to be political at all -- I’ll get harassed. Some of it is minor; sometimes it’s weeks of rape or death threats. And now I have my tour schedule online, and so anyone who’s crazy enough to take that threat and make it a reality -- knows exactly where I'm going to be. So, I'm in a situation now where I've actually had to ask people to escort me to my car after shows every time I perform on the road, just in case. That's not good for comedy. To be actually afraid for your life is not good for comedy. Some people say that political correctness is ruining comedy. Trump has suggested that as much. But I disagree. Louis C.K. right now is probably performing in a comedy club right near here, even though he sexually assaulted some of my fellow comedians. In fact, if you make a joke about Trump in the wrong place at the wrong time, those -- that's where the serious consequences are. You literally have the president of the United States bullying you online, encouraging his followers to go after you. You have the Secret Service stopping you at TSA, screwing your whole life up because you made a joke; you put a wrong picture up online, making fun of him. You have your shows canceled because there's credible bomb threats on your show. So, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the conditions are comedy aren't good because of all that. Comedians need to feel free to be able to say what they want to say in an environment to break the tension, but to not have the tension break them. So, in conclusion, Trump is bad for comedy.",nan
against,"I just want to stipulate, first off, that our assignment here is about what is bad for comedy -- not whether Trump is bad for America. I will stipulate that Trump is bad for civility, justice, decency, democracy, the fear ratio, the comedian space, and all kinds of things -- but not bad for comedy. I also want to stipulate or explain that here -- what we're here to do is not prove that Trump is good for comedy, although we happen to think that there's plenty of evidence for that -- but that he is not bad for it -- for it as a thing, not the individual lives of comedians or how difficult it raises -- it makes comedy sometimes, but for comedy and for what the purposes of comedy are in society. And by the way, as you're voting after the thing, if we have convinced you at all that Trump has been good for comedy -- that is, by definition, further evidence that he hasn't been bad for it. So, bad for comedy; what does that mean? We've skirted around that, but it -- but there's two basic meanings that that can have, right? The -- creatively, substantively, it makes for worse comedy. It degrades the nature, level of comedy that's available. And the commercial parts. Is it bad for the comedy industry? Well, the commercial part is easier to quantify and have actual facts to support. So, take, for instance, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. It went on the air on September 2015, when Donald Trump wasn't going to get the nomination, when Donald Trump certainly wasn't ever going to be elected president -- and floundered. And got bad ratings, wasn't doing well. Was the show going to last? Sixteen months later, for the first time ever, the Late Night with -- Late Show with Stephen Colbert beats what was then the number one show, Tonight Starring Jimmy Fallon. What happened 16 months later? Donald Trump was -- Donald Trump's first full week as president. And as Colbert became the delightful, brilliant, wonderful sort of face of the resistance on late-night television, he assumed that number one role in late-night from then on. He has a third more viewers than the show hosted by the guy who patted Donald Trump on camera when he came on his show. So, that's one example. Saturday Night Live -- the season of Saturday Night Live that encompassed candidate, nominee, winner -- President Trump -- for the first time, 2016, '17, was -- had -- and included my friend and collaborator Alec Baldwin impersonating him, badly or well. You be the judge -- had the largest audience, Saturday Night Live, for a quarter century. I think there's a reason for that and I think it's still Donald Trump. It's still happening. This fall's first episode, in September, had -- was the highest rated first episode of Saturday Night Live in seven years. So, the other part, which was harder to judge -- more subjective -- which is the creatively, substantively question. Seems to me that this president and the crooks and liars who work for him -- excuse the Trump bashing -- and who enable him provide a kind of unprecedented geyser of rich material for political humor and satire. The downside of Donald Trump and these people who work with him is that everybody thinks they're a comedian because it is, indeed, so obvious and so easy. And even some professional comedians were indulging as soon as he was running the ""Huge"" as a joke, or, ""Look, he's orange,"" and easy, bad jokes, because it looked so easy and because he's such a clown, a scary clown, like all clowns. But still, he's -- it's -- he makes comedy seem easy. But in fact, I think, for professional comedians and satirists and humorists, like those who write ""Veep,"" that actually raises the bar for what they have to do to be successful, that it ups everybody's game in political comedy. So, the delightful and brilliant Sara aside, I think what -- what Trump does is make life very, very difficult for hack comedians, for uninteresting comedians, and raises the -- raises everyone's standards. In that sense, he is certainly good for political comedy. There was a great example just a month ago on Saturday Night Live. The Matt Damon impersonation and performance of Brett Cavanaugh was, for my money, the best piece of political comedy I had seen in a long, long time. There's no question that that was, to me, a brilliant piece of political comedy that we have pretty much only Trump to thank for. And, by the way, it had 22-odd million YouTube views, which, if it were a TV show, it would make it number one, so also fits the commercially successful bill. And I don't think -- again, from my personal experience going on the road to promote this -- this parody Trump memoir with Alec Baldwin last year, these theaters full of people who were so delighted to laugh, not to just clap and not -- but if Alec fell into his Trump impersonation for five seconds, it wasn't a one-man Trump show, it was a discussion where he would occasionally do his impersonation of Trump. There was such a sense of catharsis and pleasure in the audience, it certainly convinced me in a visceral way I wouldn't have had from simply staring at a screen all day that the experience of comedy about Donald Trump is indeed very gratifying to those who appreciate it. They are dying to laugh in this -- in these troubled, terrible times. And to me, yes, the stakes are very, very high, higher than they've ever been. But is that bad for comedy? I don't think so. Thanks very much.  I do want to thank Intelligence Squared for inviting me to be here tonight to argue the premise that Donald Trump is not bad for comedy, an issue I have felt passionate about for over a quarter of a century. As my colleague, Kurt, pointed out, we're not here -- the bar for us, for our team, is not to argue that Donald Trump is good for comedy, though I'll take that position at least partially, but that -- simply that he's not bad for comedy. And in that regard, I would ask you all to consider the contrapositive situation in which we might have found ourselves if things had gone very differently on Election Day 2016, which is that we would have perhaps President Jeb Bush or President Marco Rubio or President Hillary Clinton, or even President Bernie Sanders. Would any of those people -- with maybe the possible exception of Bernie -- have been better for comedy than Donald Trump? I don’t think so. I think we would be in a situation where we would see not only the shows that Kurt brought up with significantly lower ratings, but conceivably some of them off the air altogether. So -- and the other question is -- so, when we talk about -- you know, as Kurt pointed out, we’re not arguing whether Donald Trump is good or bad, and we’re not arguing whether Donald Trump is good or bad at comedy. But I would argue that Donald Trump, whether or not you think he’s funny, uses comedy, particularly ridicule, very effectively. And so, in that sense, he’s good for comedy in that he’s proven, in a way that many people haven’t, particularly the large amount of topical comedy that operates inside what -- I think Eli Pariser coined the phrase “a filter bubble,” but essentially preaching to the choir. Donald Trump actually gets his audience, and possibly some people on the fringes of his audience, worked up and on his side, and changes their minds by virtue of the way that he uses ridicule. And that is not something that happens perhaps as often as those who work in comedy like to think it does. I’m not sure if Jonathan Swift ended the potato famine. I have a feeling that maybe, if we looked into it carefully, we would find out that he didn’t. I’m not sure what Horace and Juvenal did and whether people at the time thought they were a laugh riot and took to the streets in an actual riot in response to anything they wrote, but Donald Trump’s use of ridicule, of sort of visible contempt -- whether or not you think it’s funny; whether or not you think it’s particularly good comedy -- is inarguably, I would say, a form of comedy, and I think an example that maybe is top of mind for a lot of us here tonight, because it’s comparatively recent, is his referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas -- -- which one person seems to think is funny. But the rest of you, maybe not so much. And I’m not going to express an opinion about that as an acknowledged professional in the area, but I’ll say it forced her to do something -- take a DNA test and then deliver a phone book of results -- which I would say, at least at this point, appears to have been a terrible error, possibly one that’s maybe disqualifying in terms of her ambitions to be president. So, that’s an effective use of comedy that is good for comedy in that it proves its potency, but which perhaps is a bad thing in every other way that you can think of. However, if you agree with that premise, I believe you still have to support our side of the argument. So, I’ll turn back the last minute of my time to the debate, which I think you’re probably all waiting for. I will report to you listening on radio or on the podcast that our opponents have left the stage -- -- and I don’t know. They were shaking their heads, and we’re just going to try and carry on. So, vote no; Donald Trump is not bad for comedy. That’s what we’re for?  ",1.0
for," What -- I mean, I've took a little issue with the wording. It's, like, you know, people are actually dying because of Trump. So, they're not dying to laugh, maybe. But I feel like they're -- it depends on the audience. You know, people coming to see Alec Baldwin are coming to see him because they like what he's done, you know, regarding Trump. So, I'm coming at it from like, I'm getting, really, a mix of people when I perform. And it's not partisan. I really think a lot of people just don't want you to bring up politics right now in a comedy club, or in a way that seems attacking. But right now, even just a mention of something that seems attacking -- I feel like people come to a -- it's the only art form that people show up to. They'll go, ""Let's go see comedy tonight,"" and they won't research what kind of comedy it is. So, I'll get people in the audience leaving if they feel like I've -- you know, I'm not on their side or heckling in a way that's very political. And then I'm angry. And now, I don't know what to do with that anger, necessarily, in the moment. You hope to be talented enough to turn it into a hilarious joke, but sometimes that's really difficult in the moment. So, yeah. I think, yes, people need to laugh right now. They do. They need a release. I just take issue with -- that Trump jokes are necessarily the way to do that.",2.0
against,"Again, the -- when we talk about comedy, it's not all one thing that has to be -- have its maximum appeal to everybody, whether they're Trump supporters, whether they're Trump haters, or whomever. All comedy, it seems to me -- or nearly all comedy, and humor, and satire; we're not only talking about stand-up performed comedy -- has, you know, an audience. And so, the audience for political humor may not be, you know, most of -- many of your audiences. But there is, obviously -- and in my more limited experience, this fervent desire for Trump comedy, for better or worse. I would also say that, to the idea that, ""Oh, Trump is too terrible and Trumpism is too terrible for -- to deal with in a comedic fashion.” I mean, one of the greatest movies of all time, ""To Be or Not to Be"" about -- made fun of Nazis during the World -- during World War II. The great film -- the great Stanley Kubrick film, ""Dr. Strangelove,"" made fun of the end of the world in the nuclear Armageddon at the height of the Cold War. So, the idea that, somehow, because this guy, and what he represents, and the movement he is leading is so terrible -- which I gladly stipulate -- is not to me an argument that, like, you know -- -- comedy and humor is not the way to go. And that's why you became a pro-war guy.",2.0

against,"  John Gonvan . I don't know for certain whether or not Trump's ridicule changes mind in the immediate present. I think the fact that he has a penchant for that kind of contemptuous behavior is something that people like about him. And, you know, before Trump emerged as a political candidate, there was no Trump base to speak of. So that's an aspect of his personality that I think has drawn people to him. And whether or not it's -- it's changed minds, it certainly has proven politically effective and is sort of essential -- -- to his appeal. I have -- you got me. Yeah, well, I didn't make the question. Remember, I -- I have to win whatever way -- whatever way I can. And, you know, it's -- I mean, Foster has debated for millennia what the -- what the definition of the good is. But we've come up with a couple, that it's good for -- commercially for late night comedy, that it's good for making -- demanding a higher standard of comedy in general. And so -- You see what he's doing here, people. Don't fall for this.",2.0
for," I mean, you know, Kurt suggested that I'm a hack, and that's fine. I know you did. But, no. I mean, I agree, it is -- it is -- sets a higher standard, I guess in that the pool is flooded and you have to separate yourself. If you're going to do a Trump joke, it has to be different. And that, of course, is a challenge. But that doesn't mean that, you know, that's -- that's kind of the case with whatever is the big thing in the news at the time or what the Zeitgeist is. You know, there's a point where everybody's making the same joke, and you have to make sure you're not -- that your joke is unique to your point of view. That's how you sort of like buttress off like being hackie is making sure it's unique to your voice. I think oftentimes when comedians are accused of stealing jokes, it's because they're usually doing a joke that's pretty broad, that anybody could say. But I think for Trump, you know, I'm just going to always go back to the fact that, like, yeah, you know, a movie making fun of Hitler, great. But I would have rather had not had Hitler. Do you know what I'm saying? So, like that's -- -- I can't -- yeah, I know we -- But for me, to me, Trump is bad for comedy because Trump is bad for the world. I can't get around that, you know. It just always comes back to that for me.",2.0
against,"I mean, I do think there was -- to -- the argument I was making earlier about other presidents. I mean, I think we can look at a moving -- moving rapidly past whether or not we're pro or against Hitler. I do think we can look at a particular low-water mark in what I guess you could call political comedy, but only barely, which was -- which was the Clinton presidency when Jay Leno did two and a half years of Monica Lewinsky jokes, which I have to believe -- I don't know this for a fact -- but that, you know, he was sick of very quickly. But that was what constituted political comedy in that -- in that moment. And what you have with Trump is this -- you had a single subject under Clinton that dominated all others. And with Trump, you have this, you know, frequently commented on kind of cornucopia of hourly riches of things to use as an actual premise. And I'd say in that regard, it's not simply raising the bar in terms of demanding a higher quality, but it's also a much more vigorous workout for comics. And let me just think -- since I think specific examples of great comedy that come out of this are useful, and ones that maybe a lot of people have seen, I think of another Saturday Night Live sketch from before his election, one of -- this serious of sketches they do called ""Black Jeopardy,"" where the basic premise is -- and it was a beautifully done, incredibly sympathetic -- the absolute opposite of ridicule of Trump supporters that PJ warned about. Where Tom Hanks plays a Trump supporter who finds, along with the black contestants on ""Black Jeopardy,"" that they have a lot in common. It was -- it was a genius piece of writing. And -- and made people of all sorts, I think, think if not more sympathetically, at least differently and perhaps more sympathetically about the set of mental habits that led people to be Trump supporters and that makes these apparently very different people all American. So, their -- and I could go on. There are -- there are examples of brilliant comedy out of the Trump -- -- nightmare.",2.0
for,"  Yeah, I know, I'm like -- I'm like -- -- one of these doesn't look like the other in this panel, but -- Yeah, of course. I mean, I laughed at all those things, and I think there's been definitely -- I mean, there's been some really brilliant comedy about Trump, some of which include my own jokes about him. No, but, I think -- like my friend, a very funny comedian, Kurt Brownler, has a really funny joke about Trump right now. And he put it online, and it was like really popular online. And I asked him, I said, ""What's your experience like? Like, have you -- that joke is so funny, and obviously you're killing with that joke in that video at that club. But what's it been like for you?"" And he's like, ""Oh, it's so hard. I have to put that joke at the very end so that we can all disperse, you know."" He goes, ""Online, it's doing great. In clubs, it's a whole different ballgame.""",2.0
against,"Well, I think it's -- it's been fitted into a larger narrative of coastal elites, ""Hollywood people don't get us,"" that Trump himself has cleverly exploited. But I think you're -- not to issue a small reprimand, I think you're off topic. The question was not whether comedy was good for Trump, which the question is whether or not -- Or America. The question is whether or not Trump is bad for comedy. I think; however, I think that particular strawman of, you know, Jimmy Kimmel making fun of the president we love would be replaced very readily in the -- in the Trump-loving public's mind -- -- with something else if Jimmy Kimmel weren't doing what Jimmy Kimmel does. Well, we -- consumers of comedy select their comedy very carefully. They don’t -- you know, I’m not sure how many Trump -- pro-Trump comedians are out there on the circuit, but I don’t know that Trump lovers necessarily spend lots of time watching Jimmy Kimmel and yelling at the television. You know, they -- everybody’s got a remote control these days, and I think they’re probably more -- have an idea in their mind of what Jimmy Kimmel does as opposed to actually watching Jimmy Kimmel every night and becoming enraged by him. Brought us all together in our shared affection for blowjob jokes? See -- but the thing about what was true in 1993 and ‘96 and a generation -- more than a generation ago -- is there were not 500 cable channels; there was essentially not yet an internet. The -- -- culture had not been fractured and balkanized. So, you can complain about that, but that’s not -- again, that’s not unique to comedy, and again, that’s not the -- -- question of whether Trump is bad for comedy. And if we’re going to change the proposal that Trump is bad for America, Trump is bad for -- -- populism --",2.0
for,"Yeah, because I think that if you want to be a wildly successful comedian, you do have to reach past the bubble that you’re in. And as much as I would love for my audience to be filled with just one type of person who thinks just like me, I think I would get bored with that, and it would just be too easy. I’d like to try to be funny to as many people as possible. I think that’s every stand-up comedy -- comedian’s goal, and Trump is making that really hard and fractured a little bit. And I’ll just finally -- just say one more thing. I have to say this. But, like, Billy, you know, you argued, like, Trump used the word “Pocahontas,” which is a racist slur, to make a joke about Elizabeth Warren. And Trump, to me, uses comedy not -- yes, it’s effective, but he uses it as a weapon and a defense. So, he uses it to rile up hate, and he uses it to punch down, and then he’ll -- when someone goes and shoots up a synagogue, he’s like, “Well, I was just kidding,” and it’s like -- it feels insane. So, no, in that way, to me, Trump is bad for comedy, and it’s -- you know, it sucks. ",2.0

But to the point of -- that Billy made earlier, of this weaponized comedy, proving for the first time -- after debate -- as long as I've been aware of the idea of humor and satire in comedy, that, well, ""Does this actually have any political effect?"" Yes, it does, and I think back to the person who was my favored Democratic candidate, until last October -- when his life changed -- was Al Franken, thinking, ""My God, this guy could take it to this president where he lives and be both serious, and substantive, and fair, and rational"" -- and all the things that Al Franken is, but also not attempt something he has no ability at, as Marco Rubio did about the short fingers during the campaign.

And if anyone is listening on NPR with small children in their car, you might want to change the channel. But there was a joke about a golden shower. Probably most children listening will be fine with that. And -- it sounds nice. And we had to go back and edit it out after that became a topic related to Trump. We never in a -- I mean, who would have thought that we would have had to remove a reference to a golden shower in ""Veep"" because the president would somehow beat us to it? And that sort of thing, I will say -- you're absolutely right -- it does happen with this incredible Klondike of material. I'll say, if -- speaking strictly personally, Trump has made our job on ""Veep"" a little bit harder. Trump has been bad for the process of comedy, as it bears on what we do in some respects.

No, I mean, I do agree that, like -- you know, I know some comedians who just steer clear, and that's their brand, and that's what they do, and they're doing pretty well right now, I think, with audiences. You know, there's like a relief, like, ""Whew."" One thing I've noticed when I do tell a political joke is I'll get this kind of laugh, like, laugh and then, ""Ah,"" like that. You know at the end because the reality sinks in, like, it's funny, but I'm scared, you know?  In all of my audiences, there's people that I can tell they're just -- now, look, I can't tell usually by looking at someone. Now, there's some guys in the audience that you're like, oh, lord, that's a Trump supporter. You can just tell by the way they look at me. But no, you really can't tell who people are in the audience. You can tell by the way they react to certain jokes or if they heckle or verbal or roll their eyes in a certain way. But I have heard from liberal audiences like, you know, feedback like, ""I just don't want to hear about this stuff right now. I just want to laugh about something else."" Kind of, yeah.  Well -- I mean, I think it depends on the person. Some comedians get off on pissing people off, and that’s their thing. I’m not like that. I think, you know, there was a recently sort of, like, alt-right campaign to dig back through comedians’ posts on Twitter to find them making inappropriate jokes and trying to ruin their lives over that, and there’s -- the left has done that stuff, too, so I don’t want to make it one-sided. But I think there’s a sort of weaponization of outrage, and an easy target is a comedian, because -- especially online, where you can’t -- if you dig back and see a tweet from 10 years ago, the context was different; you can’t read the context necessarily. It’s just words out of context from a long time ago, and now they’re offensive, or now we don’t like those words. And that has been something that’s also come into play that’s -- and that’s not necessarily a Trump thing. That’s, like, an outrage thing. But Trump definitely plays into that, I think, because he taps into; he’s very good at using keywords and things to get people riled up and, you know --",2.0
against,"I would say it’s the other way around. I would say -- I think you’re right; there’s an argument that the reaction against PC and taboo enlargement and all that is a real thing and a real argument to have or -- and indeed drove people to Trump. But I don’t Trump drove it at all. And I don’t want to -- Billy said a thing that I think is an important point, and I want to reiterate -- -- which is that -- no, and to Sara’s point, too, that most comedy and most satire and most humor -- stand-up; print; film; television -- is not about Donald Trump, has nothing to do with Donald Trump. And it’s going great, and people are being funny. So, really, the implicit part of this question is, can there be such a thing as good Trump comedy? We think there can be. But moreover, this larger thing is it hasn’t ruined it. Sara still has a brilliant career, and so do all kind of humor creators and comedy creators who -- I would say -- but I’m curious about this, PJ, because I think, you know, one of the things that seems to be frequently claimed about Donald Trump, and maybe Donald Trump says about himself, is he participates in the breaking-down of accepted norms of discourse, and the widely accepted idea that both sides have become increasingly uncivil or in-civil , which is the correct word, to each other is happening, perhaps simultaneously with what you argue is an inflation in taboos. So, if that’s the case, if taboo inflation is what’s being bad for comedy, then I would say Donald Trump is a force in society standing firmly against that by virtue of his own taboo-breaking behavior. And a good part of comedy and humor has always been approaching taboos and breaking them, and that’s what makes people laugh, because, “ Look what she said; look what he said.” If ""The Dictator"" have been good for Hitler, would it have been good for comedy? So, I guess you could say that I suppose, yeah, the Nazis used sort of forms of heinous ridicule that was effective, but despicable. And was that good for comedy? And Kurt has prepared a really interesting answer on that. I'd like him to deliver it to you now. I honestly -- I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've been in conversation -- sometimes on a stage, even -- about -- and certainly asked by journalists, and especially in the age of Trump -- ""Well, what can satire do? Can it really have an effect?"" And I think, even though we're seeing the ill effect of Donald Trump going to Mississippi and talking to his partisans a month ago about Dr. Blasey Ford and doing a comedic riff about her lack of credibility -- it was a comedy riff, and they laughed. As -- and that's not obviously the first or last time he'll do that. But to establish that somebody can gain this immensely consequential power and affect the way people think about matters of consequence -- yes. It's -- it is the discovery of a kind of atomic energy. And as horrible as it's been, it doesn't mean it's been bad for comedy, just that it has -- it has change the nature of politics. And by the way, the nature of politics were changing long before Donald Trump and becoming a subset of show business. This is just the latest permutation of the show business-politics merger.",2.0
for," I mean, I think -- you know -- and there are comedians who disagree with me on this. But I think comedy is at its best when it is punching up. And it's about power dynamic and stuff. And so, Trump's version of comedy is, you know, slurs, and making -- you know, just middle school humor. And what that does -- that doesn't change his supporters' minds. I think it unleashes what was in there already. It's like, ""Oh, we get to say that now?  You know, and that's disturbing. It's emboldening hate speech, in a way. But I think -- and I do think there are a lot of comedians doing great comedy that subverts Trump. But I think -- I agree with PJ's question, or I think it's an important question, which is, is that the best way to fight Trump? I don't know that answer to that question.",2.0
against,"I'm going to be very brief because I'm afraid PJ took my Chris Christie bathroom scale joke. And I don't want to win here tonight on a technicality, but I'll take it. I refer you in closing to the question, to the proposition: Donald trump is bad for comedy. It isn't. You're not voting on whether or not Donald Trump is bad. You're not voting whether Donald Trump is bad at comedy. You're not voting on whether or not the comedy that Donald Trump does is comedy-like, is comedy that doesn't offend you in some way or another. You're voting on simply the narrow question of, is Donald Trump bad for comedy, or is he not bad for comedy? You're also not voting on whether or not necessarily Donald Trump is good for comedy. We've -- we've taken aim at that target, but that's exceeding our brief. My point, I think the point we've made throughout the evening is that -- is that there is -- thanks to Donald Trump, there is more comedy, comedy as a commercial enterprise and as a mechanism or as an element in our culture is on the improve -- is subject to improving trends, thanks to -- thanks to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump himself, like it or not, has proven that comedy can be an effective, what I'll call, tool. So as much as we may not like what Donald Trump uses comedy for, he has shown us a way forward for perhaps a more effective and potent use of comedy in support of the arguments and the candidates that we do believe in. And in that sense, he's given the art form some new life. I do also like to remind people that, you know, I think people flatter themselves that they live in the worst of times, the best of times. There was a time within living memory, and the end of the ‘60s, when there was active violence in the street and more potent disagreements, even, than we have now. There was a time and century before that when the debate became so uncivil that there actually was an uncivil war. With that in mind, I wouldn't ask you to despair too much of the partisan moment, but to look forward to a brighter day. And if you support a brighter day, I hope you'll vote in favor -- -- of us.

for," My closing argument is just a little anecdote. A few months ago, some friends of mine and I, we were all individually approached to be a part of a new TV show hosted by a left wing media personality. The show did not go forward, so don't try to figure out what it is. We were approached individually like to be a writer, correspondent on the show, different roles. And my boyfriend, when I told him about it, his first response was, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" And it would be a huge break for me financially and career-wise, reputation-wise. But he immediate -- and he's someone who would never question that trajectory . And he was like, ""Are you sure you want to do that?"" And I was like, ""Why?"" And he was like, ""Because it might ruin your life and it might threaten your safety if you want to be in that bullseye."" And I thought about it, and I still applied. And a friend of mine also applied, and she got as far as going in for an interview. And while in there, she -- the host apparently said to her along the line -- something along the lines of, ""If you do this” -- as a -- as a pitch to her, ""If you do this show, Trump will know your name."" And she said, ""How are you going to ensure my personal safety?"" And they laughed it off. And they're like, ""You'll be fine."" And she turned it down. So, my final point is that if comedians, who are truly thee most desperate people for attention and fame, are turning down huge opportunities because of Trump, then, yes, Trump is bad for comedy, obviously. John Donvan: And I also want to say the same thing, thanking the team of Kurt Anderson and Billy Kimball and Billy Campbell. The three of you -- -- were spectacular, but also, you just made it all so interesting. And again, thank you all for what you did on the stage. I have a question I’d actually like to put to you. This is not part of the competition; it’s just something we would be curious to hear from all four of you since we had a long talk tonight about comedy, and everyone agreeing that some people are doing it really well. I’ll start with you, Kurt. Who do you think is actually doing -- handling Trump comedy really, really well out there now?",3.0
against,"Well, because I am part of the choir to which he is preaching, I think Stephen Colbert does an extraordinary job. But beyond Trump, and toward Trumpism and being -- combining intelligent, essentially journalistic critiques of Trumpism and the rest of it, John Oliver is doing extraordinary work that -- of a kind that, yes, was pioneered by his previous employers at Comedy Central, but in combining enlightenment with ridiculous to an extraordinary degree every week. I find him doing amazing things. But, you know, yes, as a longtime Trump profiteer, I think both of those are good examples of people doing great work. And need I say it, since we’re no longer arguing the debating the point? Important work.",3.0
