for,"Well, I'm reminded of a line of Oscar Wilde's when a play opened at the Abbey Theater. He got this rousing ovation. One man stood up and said, ""You're a fraud."" And Wilde stood up and said, ""Frankly, sir, I'm inclined to think you're right, but in the fact of so much acclaim, who are we to disagree?"" Oh, this is bigger than all of those combined. This is bigger than the internet. It's bigger than the iron age, the Renaissance. It's bigger than the industrial revolution. This affects the entire world and it's going to be affected in a faster and more prevalent way than you will -- than you ever imagined."
against,"In a sentence?  Well, a radical market is a market that is designed so as to promote both welfare and equality and many of markets need to be improved and this book suggests various ways that that can be done. Yeah it was. I was careful about that. Well, if anybody here in the room has got a teenager in their lives, you know two things. First, if an adult said the sky is blue they all say it's red. And secondly, you do not ask a teenager for advice about anything let alone your investment portfolio. So, I am sure that whatever I say they will say the opposite."
for,"Well, thanks everybody for coming to this and thank you Intelligence Squared and the Adam Smith Society and our makeup girl who tried to make me look better. I wanted to say that this is sort of the perfect audience. It's a bunch of millennials and it's -- this is all going to be in your hands. It's what happens to the world. Do we have a world that you kind of grew up in where you are deeply in debt. You are coming out with a bunch of facts that don't help you get employed, and you're coming into this world that this -- your grandfather's Fiat world that's very controlled and constrained and you're saying what? Does this make any sense? And you have a major opportunity right now. All of the sudden this amazing thing happened. Sitoshi Nakamoto came up with a new kind of currency and now let me take you through a history of currencies. We used to use shells and we'd carry around shells, but then they got too bulky and then we moved to gold and then gold got too bulky and we kind of ran out of it and then it was the promise of gold or the promise of silver, and that was like a silver certificate. And then it was like the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and that's the federal reserve note. And you're looking at it and you're kind of going okay, well what is this? It's just paper. And they say the full credit of the U.S. government. There was a huge debate much like this, huge battle about should we go off the gold standard and people said no, it's just paper. We can't do that. We have to be on the gold standard because gold is really what this country is built on. And but paper, it just sort of abstracted things and then it got further abstracted. Currency, what did currency become? And all of the sudden there's this currency. It's awesome. Because we have like the federal reserve note, you are relying on a third party to hold your currency, right? You rely on a bank. I -- whenever you walk down a street of a city look at the biggest buildings in the world. They're all banks. That's your money that's gone into their buildings. Think about it. I mean, when you go to Las Vegas it's like, you know, why are all these beautiful buildings here? Well, it was your money. It's the same idea. So now you've got this new currency and your trusted third party is 100,000 computers that are all focused on making sure that every single transaction is done perfectly. So, it -- now do you think that humans are going to make sure that every single transaction is done perfectly? I've had 15 times where a bank statement was wrong. In fact, the bank actually gave me $2,000,000 at one point just here. It was there in my statement. I had to call them, talk to 15 people, figure out where that -- why I had this extra $2,000,000 and why and, you know, to give it back I had to go through about 15 people. So, in this case you've got a new currency and it's virtual and it's something that transcends geographic borders. So, you don't have to be reliant on your country. I had this great guy who came up to me and he said, his name is Sebastian Serrano , and he said, ""You know, I lived in Argentina all my life and my family fortune disappeared three times and I'm only 30 years old and it's just disappeared to currency manipulation."" And, you know, as you know the Argentinian peso has dropped 30 percent a year. Same thing with Nigerian Nira or whatever. Anyway, Sebastian said, ""I'm going to start this business and I'm going to build it all on bitcoin. And he did and it was -- and it's an enormous success. He has since created a new currency called Ribio and it's one of the top currencies of the world, cryptocurrencies of the world. Now people ask things like is it a bubble. I -- the whole premise of is it a bubble is ridiculous because our last bubble, what was that? The internet bubble. Was that a bubble? You guys still use the internet. I see some of you actually using it right now. That was no bubble. That was an amazing transformation of our world. It affected many different industries. It affected information, communications, banking. It affected -- well, it didn't really affect banking. Banking had a way of kind of slipping through. It affected gaming. All sorts of things were affected by the internet. Cars -- or taxis. So, now we've got another currency that has the ability to change enormous industries and it will change -- it can change banking, insurance, real estate, and government itself. Am I out of time? So, I want you to -- I want to make sure that you vote for no bubble or whatever. I am dying. I am really anticipating and enjoying the idea of hearing from these two because I -- Have no idea how anybody would vote no here."
against,"Thanks very much. I'm going to start with a quotation. ""When the profits of trade happen to be greater than ordinary, overtrading becomes a general error."" And I assume you're all familiar with that quotation. It's from ""The Wealth of Nations"" by Adam Smith. He was talking about the great South Sea bubble of 1711 to 1720. Adam Smith, the great theorist of the free market, was also a keen observer of the world around him. He understood that bubbles occurred and they existed. The South Sea bubble, which was kind of a speculative mania in the stock of a company that was supposed to invest in South America destroyed many fortunes, damaged the British economy significantly and continued to reverberate up until through the rest of the 18th Century when Smith was writing ""The Wealth of Nations."" Now what exactly is a bubble? Many people are skeptical despite the long historical record of bubbles culminating in the most recent bubble in your lifetime, the real estate bubble of the early 2000s, which led to the financial crisis and the great recession. A bubble occurs when the price of an asset deviates from its underlying value and the deviation is maintained for a significant amount of time. And the question is why does this occur? Isn't the market price supposed to reflect the actual value? And the explanation is complicated. Usually there's some kind of accident, sometimes a new technology. That's what happened in 1711. People get excited. The early movers make big profits. Everybody else sees this and they think well that's easy. They just bought this thing. We can do the same. As people chase their tails or their neighbors trying to get rich, the price spikes. Now, the price can go up in an asset just because that asset is very useful and so we have this pattern already of the prices of bitcoin going up and then down a little bit. And the question is, does that reflect the bubble mentality, the speculative mania, or something real? So, what I want to do in this opening statement is just to give you three reasons to think that a bubble is taking place now. And the key idea I want to convey with you is that the very elements of bitcoin that its supporters cite as support for their view that bitcoin is this great new thing, is also the greatest vulnerability for bitcoin. So first, anonymity.  So, bitcoin transactions are anonymous or more accurately pseudonymous. People use codes that are difficult to trace back to them. And this of course is attractive. People want to keep their financial transactions private. Two problems with this. The people to whom this is most attractive is criminals. That's why there's a great deal of criminal activity in the bitcoin market. Bitcoins are very good for money launderers, drug criminals, human traffickers, and many other criminals. And then there's another problem, which is that bitcoin is only anonymous for very sophisticated people, sophisticated criminals, especially. Ordinary people can't master the technology. And as a result, ordinary people have come to rely on intermediary institutions, a bit like banks. Wallet companies, for example, exchanges, and you don't get anonymity with those companies. Those companies typically insist on the identity of their customers. So ordinary people don't really get anonymity ultimately if the government believes that they're engaged in criminal transactions. Sophisticated people, sophisticated business people, and criminals do. Second feature of bitcoin, the fixed money supply. There can never be more than 21 million bitcoins because of the way that the program was designed. This is said to be good because national currencies sometimes are subject to inflation, which can be a nuisance and in extreme cases a terrible -- cause terrible problems. The problem, though, is the fixed money supply is no good either. Fixed money supply leads to deflation, which is just as bad as inflation. People will hoard the currency as they are with bitcoin because they believe they'll be able to buy more goods and services in the future. A currency that is not used is dysfunctional. Bitcoin can't be successful as long as there's a limited money supply. But even more important than that, government's control of the money supply is absolutely essential for addressing financial crises like the one we lived through in 2008 and addressing recessions like the one we lived through in the years after the financial crisis. If the money supply is truly fixed the government is helpless. Back when the United States was on the gold standard in the 19th Century, there was an endless cycle of speculative manias, crashes, and terrible depressions, far worse than anything we've experienced since the great depression. Now this leads to a third point, which is in fact the money supply is not really fixed. That's actually a bit of a myth and it's connected to the third element of bitcoin that its supporters cite, which is the decentralization. The idea that nobody controls it and so we don't have to worry about manipulation. Okay, now that is false and it's important to understood -- understand that that's false. It's true that bitcoin isn't like the dollar, which is controlled by the central bank, a bunch of political appointees, but it is controlled by the bitcoin miners, the so-called miners, the people who create bitcoins as a part of the transaction confirmation function that they serve in this currency network. It turns out that a very small number of people own the vast majority of bitcoins and the way that it works is when the Bitcoin protocol needs to be changed -- and that has to happen, and it has happened several times -- it's the Bitcoin miners -- the people with 51 percent of the computing power -- who determine that. Who are they?  Probably a lot of foreigners, possibly foreign governments. I'll have another Adam Smith quote for you, but I'm out of time. So, I'll just say Bitcoin is a bubble. Vote no on the motion. "
for,"Bitcoin is more than a bubble. It is here to stay. You should vote yes. Here is why. First of all, for 6,000 years, humans who engage in consensual exchange have had to go about it one way. Well, we have this trouble of -- this problem of trust. How do we solve trust? I'm trading you a camel for your gold coin. How do I trust that you debase the coin or not? So, we -- there are people who create business models -- in that case, a mint. The guy who has a monopoly on violence in an area creates a mint, puts his face on the coin; says, ""If you debase this, I kill you. That's a business model -- the way to monetize his monopoly on violence. There's lots of business models. But that enables us to engage in our trade. Lots of business models -- lots of institutions, I should say, have that same feature. Land titling, for one thing. Visa cards, for another. If you come into my store, I don't know you. You don't know if you can trust me. I don't know if I can trust you. We each just trust Visa just like we each just trust the land titling office or we each just trust the mint. So, for 6,000 years, that's the way we've been going about solving things. We create these central institutions that -- since we can't trust each other, we just trust them. For the first time in 6,000 years, we can have consensual exchange among strangers that is trustworthy. In other words, we have a way to do something that for 6,000 years humans have done by creating these institutions. We can now -- and those institutions have accumulated, like barnacles on the hull of civilization. Some of them are private corporations. Some of them are functions of government. But remember, we -- you know, they didn't come out of a burning bush. We created them, so we can go about achieving our ends. It's now possible to achieve those functions without those institutions. And we can see -- we will see many of them -- this is why Tim is correct. This is -- I heard somebody snicker when he said, ""This is bigger than the Internet."" It's much bigger than the Internet. The Internet disrupted publishing. I've been in a Silicon Valley company where there's 160 institutions on the wall. By institutions, I mean everything from notary publics to Wall Street, to many of the functions of lawyers and judges -- can all be reduced to smart contracts and such. So, our -- so, we will not have to rely on those central institutions nearly as much, going forward. Here's a big one that's really important to us, and I'm going to -- here's a big one that's really important. I -- some of the old-timers here may remember the Soviet Union. And there was this country that tried to run itself, setting prices -- 23 million prices on 23 million things. The screws on this stand would have been sent by some bureaucrat in Moscow in a big ledger book -- and such, eventually on computers. And we think that's ridiculous. See how silly these people were to try to run a society with them setting prices on 23 million things? But here in our society, what's the single most price -- what's the single most important price any society faces? It's the price at which we discount the future against the present, which is to say interest rates. And currently, those are -- that price is being sent in a central department of Central Planning called the United States Federal Reserve. Now, my worthy opponent -- Eric Posner -- believes that we need government to manage that. What did he say? We need government that can -- needs to address the money supply to manage the economy. People like this is -- you have to -- when you -- I think of -- there was a Great London School of Economics professor who has described certain people's mentalities -- the economy is this big engine. And they're the workmen, with the baseball caps, and the coveralls, and the screwdriver. And only they know just how to fine-tune it, just how to get the carburetor right and such, and you got to -- when you hear that, remember the Dilbert strip. The pointy-hair manager in the corner, who always -- ""He knows what's best."" He's in the corner. ""He knows better than those people out in the cubicles do. He knows what's best. You know, what could possibly go wrong? Every day he's got a different solution to something."" And that is the mentality of the people who think that we need government to do all these things for us. They need to manage our money supply for us. Well, here's a different way to think of it -- how we used to think of it. We have to communicate with each other information about value and scarcity. That's what a price is. It's a packet of information about value and scarcity so we can all communicate to each other. We want a form of money that we can communicate that information to each other without having to go through some field -- some form by which we send that signal, through some field that any government mandarin controls. Then we can really communicate the truth to each other. The mandarins want to have their hands on the dial to be able to adjust that field and distort that signal to serve their own private political ends. That's why they're against Bitcoin. They don't want a form of monies that mandarins can't control it. And regarding that point, you know, we have seen in the last financial crisis that the oligarchs -- they have bought themselves some senators. They bought themselves congressmen. They bought themselves the esteemed regulators to whom Mr. Posner bows. They bought themselves all kinds of things. One thing that they can't buy is the laws of mathematics. They can't buy the mathematics that underlies cryptography, which is why we should rebuild our social institutions on crypto -- and in particular, Bitcoin. "
against,"  Well, I come last, but not least, to tell you why you should vote against this motion. And I tell you that not because I am an esteemed professor of law and finance -- like Professor Posner -- but because I am both a journalist and trained as a cultural anthropologist. And as an anthropologist, I can tell you three things about money. Firstly, that societies all over the world have used all kinds of things to create money over history. There is nothing special about fiat currency. Secondly, fiat currency has problems, as you've heard. I will admit that. But thirdly, and this is a key point -- the problems with fiat currency today are nothing compared to the problems with Bitcoin. And to understand that, you have to go back for a moment and think about first principles and think about what money does. Because, if you believe that Bitcoin is so valuable, you have to believe it's a fantastic type of money. So, what does money do? Well, as you all know, it's, one, a medium of exchange; two, a store of value. And sometimes, three, an investment too. So, think about it. Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, compared to fiat currency. Well, I don't know how many of you in the room have actually got Bitcoin, but any of you who have got Bitcoin will know it's a pretty lousy medium of exchange right now. You can't actually do very much with it. Yes, you can buy stuff on Overstock, and I've given you a free promotion, Patrick.  I work on commission. But not in Bitcoin. But right now, the system can only process seven transactions a second. That is nothing compared to the amount you actually need to make it a viable medium of exchange. It's slow. It's clunky. It's expensive. There ain't that many places you can actually use it. I mean, some of you may have seen the great New York Time piece recently, about trying to use Bitcoin in New York. And guess what? It's tough. Not a great medium of exchange. The other problem, of course, is its value has fluctuated dramatically. So, you might say, ""Well, what about store of value?"" Well, if you think it's a great store of value, you have to say, ""What is underpinning that store of value?"" And as Patrick says, trust underpins money. The roots of the word credit come from ""gredere,"" meaning Latin ""to believe."" So, what underpins Bitcoin? It ain't trust in government. It's trust in, one, computers. Those wonderful, reliable, 100,000 computers that never break down, never get hacked, never have any kind of viruses. Are you guys ready to trust in computers forever? You trust in the wisdom of crowds. You trust in this idea there's always going to be roaring demand for Bitcoin. Well, maybe. As you just heard before, from Professor Posner, bubbles, manias come and go. Last, but not least, you trust in the fact that the supply is limited. Well, yes. Right now, those wonderful magicians of cryptography have created a system which has a limited supply of Bitcoins. But what about Ephyrium ? What about Bitcoin cash? What about all those other Bitcoins that are coming out too? Who actually believes that the first of Bitcoin is going to be the only Bitcoin? I mean, remember a time we all thought that Sony Walkmans were the coolest thing out? I mean, you're probably too young for that. But think about it. Who actually thinks that Bitcoin is going to be the only idea like that? Why couldn't there be 20,000 more Bitcoins? In which case, what is that going to do to the value? Then you might say, ""Well, you know what? Yeah, we see all those problems with Bitcoin. But actually, fiat currency, that's even worse. Those governments, they cannot be trusted."" To which I say this: okay. Maybe you don't like fiat currency. Maybe you think there are problems with government; you don't like institutions. Yes, I hear you. But what about this? There is actually something else out there which has been around for thousands of years, that doesn't require actually betting on a computer. Doesn't require betting that, somehow, the first mover, the first innovation on Bitcoin is going to last. There is something out there which is completely portable -- something out there which doesn't require enormous amounts of electricity. And let's not forget the fact that to create one Bitcoin requires the energy usage of the typical American household over two years. Last year, Bitcoin mining took up all the electricity consumption equivalent to Denmark. Next year it will be Argentina. But there's something else out there that doesn't need that. And it's terribly simple. It's called gold. So, if you don't like Bitcoin -- I'm sorry; if you don't like fiat currency, okay, fine. I happen to think it's not so bad -- not ideal, not so bad -- but if you don't like fiat currency, go buy gold -- because Bitcoin -- AKA digital gold -- is a pretty lousy alternative. And the great thing about gold is that if it all goes horribly wrong, you can always wear it. You can put it in your teeth. So, vote against the motion."
for,"There's a mathematics that underlies cryptography. Technically, it's called non-polynomial one-way trapdoor functions. This area -- cryptography harnesses this area of mathematics to make things unbreakable, so they can be encoded one way but not decoded. And that mathematics and that cryptography underlies all the cryptography of the modern era, from HTTPS, to you logging onto your bank account, to the -- what's under Bitcoin. It's the same general field of math, of cryptography. If somebody ever breaks this -- and there's talk about quantum computers and stuff -- they should be quantum resistant. But it's the most hacked-on thing in history -- Bitcoin is. It's every day, and more people hack on . If anyone can break this, they can break any government and bank encryption system in the world."
against,"And they get hacked all the time as well. And there have been hacks, already, with Bitcoin."
for,"Well, this has been hacked at more than anything in history and has never been defeated. Now, there are companies that spring up in the Bitcoin community that get hacked. These different exchanges, they get hacked. But the last I checked, you know, banks get hacked too. And yeah, Bitcoin is used by unsavory characters. The last I checked, they used U.S. dollars too."
against," But when banks get hacked, eventually you have a big enough pool of money that's separate from the thing that they've just hacked to be able to repay the customers."
for,"Well -- Now, Gillian, you said that -- you said, ""Oh, do you really want to trust computers?"" Computers are running all your banks. It's just, those are weaker security systems than Bitcoin. I am so much secure in my Bitcoin than I am in the money that's sitting there in Wells Fargo."
against,"But Tim, you're -- I'm not saying, do you want to trust computers? I'm saying, do you only want to trust --"
for, You said --
against, Do you want to only -- do you only want to?
for,Do you want to trust computers?
against," But Tim, Tim, Tim, do you only want to trust computers? The point is this. If you're going to a bank, you're not only trusting your computer for the value of your money. You're trusting the computer, but you have a backup. And the backup is called a central bank. With Bitcoin, you are only trusting computers."
for," You mentioned the central bank. You mentioned the -- -- So, you mentioned the central bank. Central bank always gets it wrong. So, when you're in recession, they shove you further into a recession. When you're in a boom, they push you higher in a boom -- -- because they move so slowly."
against,But Tim --
for,"And they move -- and they never react. And then they react too late and too strongly, and the government regulations -- the same thing happens with the government regulations. They add more regulations when you're already -- you've already got both hands tied behind your back and you're trying to feed your family."
against,"Okay, Tim. There's a reason -- guess what. I agree with you. But there's a reason why the U.S. constitution is based on checks and balances. There’s reason why investors do not put all their eggs in one basket. Essentially, money is not just your eggs in one basket. Putting your money into a bank is not your eggs in one basket. Having some faith in a central bank is not all your eggs in one basket. The problem with Bitcoin is you're betting entirely on the sanctity and the durability of those computers. There is nothing else backing it up."
for,You said earlier --
against,There's no check and balance.
for,"Neither of you have Bitcoin wallets. I heard that earlier, right?"
against,Tim Draper: You probably shouldn't keep all your eggs in one basket. There is another basket now. And guess what? I have several currencies.
for, But they're all fiat. They're all fiat.
against," Different governments. Different governments. They're from different governments. They're from different governments. And I also have gold, and I also have other types of --"
for,It's -- how do you know the --
against,"It's called hedging your bets. This is the Adam Smith .  Let it be. Let it be. It's just currency that the government creates -- the central bank creates. And then it guarantees that it will retain its value. And just in response to Tim, every advanced successful economy has had a central bank for the last several centuries. They've done quite well. The economies have done quite well. The central banks have generally been pretty good at dealing with the financial crisis?"
for,"Are satisfied with ""pretty good?"""
against,"Okay -- Okay. All right. Now, the -- my other Adam Smith quote, ""The government of an exclusive company of merchants is perhaps the worst of all governments."" And I'm quoting him because despite what Gillian said -- she was speaking loosely -- Bitcoin is not entirely controlled by computers. It's controlled by the programmers and the miners, right? So, the code that was created back in 2009 -- the guy who created it, this mythical person -- Satoshinaka Toma -- he knew -- he knew that he could not create a system that will work forever and that will never have any problems. And so, the code provides for its own amendment by human beings. So, those human beings are the company of merchants. They're the Bitcoin holders. They're the miners. And also, they're the programmers -- the people who are trusted by the miners and other people in the Bitcoin community to revise the program as necessary, as they have done several times. These are the people that -- -- people that you trust -- right, yes."
for,"Oh, well, I think that's false. I think that -- -- it's an open source project. And sometimes people don't get open source. But it is a collaboration among a lot of people creating this code. But that collaboration is all transparent, and the records are all transparent, and some of us find it a more trustworthy process than the current sausage making we see in the political machine around us. And open source project -- you know, if there's any monkey business in the code, everybody can see it. It's a much more transparent process than the current political process."
against,"Transparent, but under the patrol of a small number of individuals."
for," Well, it's -- what you mean -- what I assume you mean by that is --"
against,"-- of the hashing power is necessary to change the code. And a small number of people possess that power. As of 2014, those people collectively were on the stage at a conference, I think, in New York -- just a small number of people who can act in concert if they want to. Those are the -- that's the central bank of Bitcoin. That's the Fed of Bitcoin."
for,"You know, you -- -- You can -- I'm glad Eric brought that up, because --"
against,And the holdings are very concentrated as a result.
for," I'm glad Eric brought that up, because he's spreading fear, which is sort of what you get from the news and whatever."
against,Even the media.
for,"But when you want to set up -- any of us can set up a Bitcoin mining system. And there are hundreds of them being -- they're all trying to get pitched. They're all pitching me and saying, ""Hey, put money into my Bitcoin mining system."""
against, Anyone who can get money from you --
for,"There is no way -- -- that anyone is going to have more than 50 percent control of this. It's spread out all over the place. And then you talked about criminal activity.  They're catching everybody who's using Bitcoin because there's a perfect ledger. There's the block chain. And people are looking at that block chain. And I -- the U.S. Marshals Office started by saying, ""You've got to make this illegal,"" and then they said, ""No, not so fast,"" because they are catching every single Bitcoin criminal. And they're doing it by going ahead. You -- they're allowed to get that Bitcoin. But as soon as they start spending it -- -- on the block, and they know -- -- Wait, wait -- one more -- whoa -- You said I could keep pushing -- And I am. And I am.  If you want to be -- -- a criminal, if you want to be a criminal, use fiat. It's so much easier."
against,"25 percent of people who use Bitcoin are criminals, according to a study that just came out a couple days ago. The money laundering -- $100 billion or more a year. Most of it is Bitcoin. The reason why -- so, Bitcoin is, as I said, pseudonymous -- this public ledger just has codes. It doesn't have your actual name. So, a very sophisticated criminal can use those codes in a way as to maintain their anonymity. Now, it's true. What Tim says is that ordinary people who are not very smart, and don't know what they're doing can make mistakes, which makes it very easy for the government to track them down, as happened with the Silk Road exchange. But the really smart people --"
for, You're saying that --
against,-- the foreign governments --
for,-- is not a smart guy?
against,-- the foreign governments --
for,The guy who ran Silk Road? Have you read the book?
against, I have not.
for,It's unbelievable how smart that dude is.
against,"Well, not smart enough. But not as smart as the -- not as --"
for,"There aren't any smarter.  -- it's going to be -- and he got busted. So, don't even try it."
against,"But let's go back to the first principle. The reason why people are buying Bitcoin, investing in it is not because they think it's going to be this incredible useful thing for criminality per se. The reason why most people buy it is because they think it's either going to keep going up, and up, and up, or because it's going to become a mainstream currency that will be useful. And the question I still have is why on earth do we think that Bitcoin is going to become this incredibly, widely-used useful currency compared to all the other alternatives?"
for,Or they --
against,Why do we think the first -- -- is there any technology in the world -- any bit technological advance we've had where the first mover advantage ensured that that stayed dominant all the way through? There are always copycats.
for,"Well, there's a reason they could be switching to Bitcoin. They're on the streets of Venezuela and starving, and they want a form of money where they can still function. Or they're in --"
against,"Created by the -- What's wrong with gold? -- Venezuelan government, though."
for,"Wait, wait -- Well, they were like -- I thought you were the government lover."
against,"   But he's the government hater, right? And so, this cryptocurrency is going to be created by the Venezuelan government. "
for,"Based on an oil -- they're created an oil-backed currency. But the great adoption of Bitcoin -- you look where it gets its spikes -- it's in places like Crete, and Greece, and Venezuela, as everything collapses. Zimbabwe -- people want some place they can go and get rid of this fiat. Everybody fiat, you know, well -- anyway. They get rid of their fiat, into Bitcoin. That's where the big spikes of Bitcoin --"
against,"Patrick, have you ever been in a war zone?"
for,I was --

against," There -- you know, since the advent of modern capitalism there have been periodic financial crises. They are devastating events where the money disappears. People hoard their money. Economic activity stops. Banks fail. Over hundreds of years governments have figured out ways to address financial crises. We're all familiar with, for example, FDIC insurance and that the fed acts as the lender of last resort. So, when that happens the government actually makes money, pumps it into the economy, gets the economy going again, and then the money is returned to the government at the end. The bank of England has been doing this for hundreds of years. The United States did this at the beginning of its history until Andrew Jackson shut down the national bank after a devastating financial crisis in 1907 where Wall Street had to step in because the U.S. government had no power to do it. The fed was created in 1913 and given this authority again. It failed in the Great Depression. It didn't use the authority that was given it, but since then it's been quite effective and successful at maintaining financial -- The government wouldn't do anything and people can hoard bitcoins just the way they hoard U.S. dollars."
for," Well, that history is extremely selective. That history is extremely selective. We did have deflation in the 19th Century. We had growth in the 19th Century. We had banking crises. It was legalized. Wherever you have fraction reserve banking you eventually have crises and things topple over and you need a central bank. The fraction reserve aspect was legal -- in England and Robert Peele in 1946 I think and then we adopted this in 1907 what bothered the progressives was that we got out of 1907 with just private action, which J.P. Morgan went down, organized group of bankers, went down and got the system unkinked. That offended those who wanted more government. They said we can't have private actors with this kind of power. We need the government to have this ability and this was born via federal reserve --"

They're the Dilbert Gods in the corner saying oh, what could possibly go wrong, and they go from collapse to collapse to collapse. They just -- it's just -- it's old wine in new bottles. They just keep reflating and then we have a bigger crash and you have the Greenspan put and then you have 2008 and they just re -- it's old wine in new bottles. And eventually as me said, you know, all expansions that come about from expanding the money supply and then it crashed. This is going to go on and on until we have a Greek-style crisis."
for,"So, I want to address one issue you said, Gillian. This has been fun. You talked about --"
against,It totally has been.
for,--- value fluctuation.
against,We have a bet in five years' time. You're buying the coffee.
for,"And the reason -- and you said value fluctuation. Well, there is always going to be value fluctuation, but bitcoin is not volatile at all. One bitcoin equals one bitcoin. One bitcoin --"
against,"Well, try telling that to anyone that's bought a bitcoin and ."
for,But as these fiat currencies -- fiat currencies are very volatile against bitcoin because they are floating and disappearing -- Gillian Tett: Okay. But they drift away over time.
against,"Tim, I can tell you there's only one thing basically that has looked as volatile as bitcoin, and that is something called Vicks ETS . And those went up and down and imploded. Anything that swings, you know, 50, 100 percent or whatever in a few months if volatile."
for,"Well, it depends on your perspective, though, because bitcoin is very stable. And all these fiat currencies are falling away."
against,"Tim Draper: I just want to make sure she -- Exactly. Yes, yes, yes, and yes."
for,"I'm regular folk. I don't know what these guys are talking about. We're regular folk and I -- I'm always a little embittered whenever I hear people say oh, I know better than you do what you should do with your money. I'm looking, I'm saying well, you know what to do with your money, but we're giving you an alternative like hey, you may want to move some of your money into this thing because it -- like if a government collapses you can get -- go into another country and just pull it down."
against,So why couldn't you do that with gold?
for,"Well, you can't because it's -- you're stuck in just the countries that the U.S. is friendly with. And they're fewer and fewer, by the way."
against,"I'm lost. I think that people should be aware this is very risky. And anyone who is giving you advice that go invest, I mean, you should maybe holding 5 percent of your assets in the cryptocurrency may be prudent, I don't know, but you shouldn't be -- I hear of people all the time who are sinking a whole bunch of their money into it and it's way too risky to do that."
for,"Yeah, I was three weeks early. I probably should have -- Actually, no. It was just sort of like, “Oh, yeah, okay. Well, now what?” And now it’s $250,000 by 2022. But I -- there's some -- I -- part of it is I sort of have seen these amazing transformations of the world from just the very beginning, just from -- like, there was just two guys and a dog that started Hotmail, and all the sudden we are all communicating through web-based email for free. And there was just one -- two guys and probably a cat that started Skype, and all the sudden we're all seeing each other when we communicate with each other for free. And that all started just with this little thing, and it spreads very quickly around the world. And once it spreads, we all kind of go, “Oh, yeah, that's obvious, of course. We can Skype each other. Oh, yeah, no problem.”"
against,"  No, actually, I’ll say -- okay, I'll say it differently. You said earlier, Tim, that basically you had the Internet boom and bust, but the internet’s still here. But guess what? "
for,It got much bigger. And they call that a bubble.
against," Tim, Pets.com is not still here."
for,"Oh, yeah. Oh, you can pick out --"
against,Bitcoin is like Pets.com.
for,"-- one out of, like --"
against,Because guess what?
for,"-- 500 companies. However, Bitcoin --"
against,"There were a lot of -- a lot of internet darlings in 2000 that boomed, that went as high as, say, Bitcoin has, okay? People looked like a genius for a moment, and then they collapsed. And, yes, the internet survived. Yes, blockchain will survive. But will Bitcoin survive? Bitcoin is the Pets.com of the cryptocurrency world."
for,"Okay, well, I would argue -- I would argue that --"
against,Remember it? There’s a reason why you don’t.
for,"It’s very likely that Bitcoin does end up winning this long-term crypto battle. And it is sort of an internal battle, but, boy, we’re all out there for the right thing. "
against,"Sorry, -- No, --"
for,I didn’t make my point!
against,Did Tim say that it is going to win or not going to win?
for," No, I did not. I did not. But Bitcoin -- the value of Bitcoin is tied to the network and how big that network is. And according to Metcalfe’s law, the power of a network is the number of nodes in that network -- number of people -- squared. And so, Bitcoin already has, like, two thirds of the -- they have a huge lead. They have an enormous lead -- And it can evolve. Because their network --"
against,Why exist?
for,It can --
against,Why does exist?
for,"And new technologies will come up, but just as Microsoft added those technologies as they benefited from them, Bitcoin is doing that, too."
against,So -- but --
for,"-- lightning network sped it up pretty fast, and that had to do with another technology that came from another cryptocurrency, and they brought it in --"
against,You’re just saying that Bitcoin is the -- . -- Myspace of the cryptocurrency. 
for,"No, but Bitcoin can evolve -- May I actually -- I’m a small, as Milton Friedman would say, small-L libertarian, but you have to admit some degrees of paternalism, and in that case, no, you have to have -- I think there have to be companies with the wallets that perform the KYCAML and the customer service. So, when Grandma forgets her password, it cannot just be a pure “you're on your own system”. So, there have to be a ring of companies that build up -- that attach to the system and provide that extra layer of service and trust."
against,"-- These companies are going to be -- if Bitcoin ends up dominating currency, when you walk down a street in a small town, and you look at the biggest buildings in the street, they're going to be owned by these big companies. They're the banks of the future which will act as intermediaries, and they'll skim off the profit. with the bank."
for,They’ll be little storefronts that let you come in and use -- That's all they need to charge for.
against,Why not have a bank?
for,"Well, no, we can -- I happen to have just been with regulators in Washington the other day and talking about what we're doing with Wall Street. You could -- you can eliminate the role of exchanges. You could have decentralized exchanges. That's not a healthy first step. I think that we ought to take an incrementalist approach. I remind the young bucks like Tim I run into in this field, “Remember Frankenstein?” The lesson of Frankenstein was that the scientists has to be thinking about the effects that he’s maybe not thinking about. Anyway, no, we want to replace the system incrementally. I'm happy to back him up there. I do understand that with your own money you want to make sure that you're set, and that this is a risk -- we all know it's a risk -- but over time I think your Bitcoin ownership should continue to increase, and I believe that there will be a point at which you will no longer really want any of the fiat currency. And to my -- my answer is I'm not completely sure I'm right. I'm not completely sure I'm right, and I don't want to tell Grandma to go put her savings into this. Let's see how it evolves."
against,"Yeah, I agree, it’s a debate-ending concession, and the reason is -- -- is that Patrick -- What Patrick is saying is that Bitcoin is a speculative investment the way the South Sea stock was. Maybe if you have a lot of money, you want to put a little money -- a little bit of money in it. But a currency has to be used by everybody. That’s the idea. It’s got to be 100 percent used."
for,"I consider that an asterisk. I’m speaking -- -- to the investors -- settle down, Bruce . to the specific question of, do people go in and invest? I try to stay somewhat agnostic about that. But on the question of, is this here to stay, is this going to re-architect the institutions of civilization? Yeah, I think so. I just -- that doesn’t mean I want to tell Grandma to go and put her savings in it, because I . I’m going to toss it to Eric after I make my point, just so he -- and then I’m sure he’ll toss it to him. The regulators have the point of view, from what I can tell, that Clinton’s -- the Clinton administration did regarding the internet. “If we regulate this, it may go abroad. We don’t want the center of gravity to be in Beijing.” And so, they have had a relatively hands-off attitude, and I think that that’s smart, and this absolutely will -- there is enormous -- Beijing, China, has named a new five-year plan -- has named four technologies they want to dominate the world in at the end of this five-year plan. They’re four -- they’re one year into it. One of the first of those four is blockchain. So, this -- we absolutely have to be afraid that some other country gets the jump on us in this research."
against,"Well, regulators are extremely skeptical about Bitcoin, and they’re cracking down on it. But they’re also worried, as Patrick says, about losing a competitive edge and destroying a nascent technology that might be helpful in some way. But if Bitcoin ever became a currency, if it took over, then regulators of all developed countries, and all countries, would destroy it, because it’s -- you need to have a national currency that’s controlled by the central bank. Bitcoin currency would not be tolerated unless it’s a kind of a --"
for,"Are you -- -- saying if Bitcoin succeeds, it will fail --"
against,"If it succeeds, yes."
for,-- because it will attract -- By then it’ll be too late for them to stop it. just before it gets too late for them to stop it.
against,"And you actually -- -- see that already in China, where the Chinese authority feels threatened by this, and so they’re clamping down. And in India, Japan -- And in India and Japan. So, guess what? The value of Bitcoin goes down. Ironically, something which was created as a howl of protect against government is still very affected in its price by the actions of government. But the other thing is that in terms of -- if you look at Bitcoin, you know, we mustn’t confuse blockchain and Bitcoin, because they’re not the same. Many central banks and governments are saying, “You know what? Blockchain -- yeah, it’s a useful technology. There are many different applications.” But Bitcoin -- this was the first thing that sprung up out of blockchain, and for all the reasons we said, it looks like the MySpace of the cryptocurrency world. And just because government feels skeptical about that doesn’t mean they’re saying no to blockchain."
for,"If this -- This is sort of a hot one for me, because I had -- the prime minister of Estonia came to Draper University and said just by instituting digital signatures, they saved 2 percent of the GDP, and all the young people started to vote when they did digital voting. And then they did digital identity, and the crime rate went down; the business climate went up. And then they gave -- he gave me this virtual residency card, and he said, “And governance can now compete across border virtually.” And it got me thinking that, ultimately, we’re going to have the terrestrial part of governance, and then we’re going to have the virtual part of governance. And the virtual part will have to, in effect -- Compete. -- compete for us."
against,"And Tim -- Tim, they can --"
for,"And they’ll be accountable to their constituents. And I think that’s a whole new way of thinking. I think it’s going to change all of our thinking. And so, regulators are going to say, “Well, wait. Okay, we have all of these rules” -- Don’t point at me on regulators. Point at that guy.   We’re going to have all these rules, and we’re stuck with them. And all of a sudden, there’s this new thing, and it’s virtual. And so, we’ve got to figure out how we separate our virtual piece and have that piece really compete. Our terrestrial -- -- piece still can be a monopoly -- The rest --"
against,"Tim, I have to pour cold water on your vision of Estonia as being this happy place of virtual nirvana --"
for,"No, no. Hey, wait, wait, wait -- -- there are many others --"
against,-- have you heard --
for,Singapore’s --
against," Tim, Tim, wait. Have you heard -- -- of what came after that? It’s called Russian hacking. Have you seen what happened in Estonia when the Russians hacked into Estonian computers? Is that what you want for the future?"
for,Have you seen what happened here in our election when they hacked --
against," It’s called belts and braces. It’s called having checks and balances, not putting all your eggs --"
for,But they --
against,-- in just one market.
for,"I think -- On the first one, in the Austrian answer is you don't get the financial crises. You use -- interest rates no longer get set by pointy-haired Dilbert guy in the corner in the Federal Reserve who thinks he can finetune the U.S. business cycle. Interests become a way that the crowd -- we can coordinate our preferences about time and interest and what's the real value of money and such with each other, and you have stable, steady growth. And the reason we have booms and busts is because we have that guy with his hand on the rear stat , subject to political pressure, who when things get a little rocky takes political pressure and floods the economy QE1, QE2, QE3, whatever, and that's why we have these booms and busts. And if we switched to an economy that was gold-based or based on some form of money through which we can communicate that no Mandarin can distort, we get rid of the financial crises."
against,"That's simply not true. So, there are booms and busts long before there was government intervention. There were booms and busts under the gold standard in the 19th century. Financial crises aren't caused by currency. They're caused by excessive lending against weak assets, bad assets, assets that people overvalued. They’ll continue to exist in the economy -- -- dominated by Bitcoin. And can I just add to that? There were booms and busts back in Mesopotamia. The reason why you have the phrase “wiping the slates clean” was because in the old days, many thousand years ago, there’d be too much lending in Mesopotamia. They’d record on the slates; they’d wipe the clay tablets clean every seven, 20, 50 years. And guess what? You go back to zero. So, booms and busts have been everywhere."
for,"  The booms and busts could go -- could -- they could continue or maybe not, but one thing's for sure. Governments that are forced to compete with each other for you are going to do a lot better than the ones that are -- that think that they have a monopoly and they can do whatever they want. Right now, we have a government in the U.S. that's -- 51 percent of the GDP is government spending, and we're stuck with it. And they're deciding -- fit more -- for every person that's out there pulling a sled, there's one standing on the sled saying -- telling him, you know, that he's got to keep one hand behind his back."
against,You can buy Swiss currency.
for," This glass --the company that created this glass had to compete with all the other companies that create these glasses, and they make -- And they make them better and better and better so -- and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper -- so that they provide a really good product or a really good service. So, any company out there that is alive today is doing what they can to compete for you, to try to get you to be a customer of theirs. Governments don't feel that way. Historically, they've thought, “We control everything that we see, and we'll just tell you what the rules are. And we know better than you do what to do with your money, what to do -- how to live your life, whatever.” Now, governments are going to do that but then at their own peril, because other governments are going to step up and say, “Hey, we can provide a better health care program here. Hey, we can provide a better pension system than these -- than your government does.” Those things can be completely separate. Well, Bitcoin is a natural for this free market in the world, because Bitcoin is cross-border and -- -- global and decentralized."
against,"Bitcoin has nothing to do with the size of the government. The government will still be able to tax people. It’ll still be able to borrow. In fact, it’ll be able to borrow more effectively because people won't be worried about inflation. They can spend as much as they want. Bitcoin is not going do anything about that.  And basically, if you're worried about the value of the U.S. dollar and what the Fed is doing, there is a much simpler alternative. Just go and buy a wide basket of currencies, buy a little bit of real estate, buy some forests, buy a bit of gold, hedge your bets. It's 101 investment principles."
for,"Well, we do allow you to pay in Bitcoin now -- or we allow you to trigger something, and then, as you shop, you see everything in Bitcoin. So, you see everything in Bitcoin prices. I guess -- you know, what happens -- the history of money is that it starts off as commodities and it's the commodity in a society that is the one that is most useful and interchangeable -- it's used in barter. And then the one that's most used sort of becomes the one that everybody adopts and becomes the currency. And can I see that happening with Bitcoin? I can see that happening in places as they collapse. And if there's ever a currency crisis in the United States, I could see it happening here. You know -- So -- So, I --"
against,It depends on your timing.
for,"This is a great question, because I've just gotten two emails that were very interesting -- e-commerce emails. And one was there is a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken that is only available in Bitcoin. And it's in Canada. And they've got a Bitcoin bucket."
against,We should concede at this point.
for,And it's only available. And then the -- You guys should concede period. And the other -- the other one is --
against,"If it happens in Canada, it must be true."
for,"The other one is, I got this other email, and it said, ""Here's this beautiful mansion, and it's just -- it's a thousand bitcoin."" And I pushed, sort of thinking, ""Well, what does that mean in dollars?"" And then I realized, ""No, that's the only way that guy is going to sell that house."" It's really interesting. It's a new way of thinking, and it's coming."
against,It's a fabulous question.
for,"So, that's a great question. Well, Bitcoin does have a unique place, because everybody is confident of its fairness and how it came about, and everything. In terms of Sitoshi and the dates he chose, and so forth -- that -- no one is disputing there was any pre-mining or any of these other things that with coins. What a lot of companies -- Bitcoin -- the Bitcoin block chain, to Gillian's point, is too slow. Seven transactions per second is too slow to support the modern world. Visa handles 30,000 per second. What people do is they create what are called side chains -- other distributive ledgers that they do the work to. But then everyone sort of agrees -- they anchor that work back to the Bitcoin block chain. So, Bitcoin may not end up being the mechanism that underlies a bunch of other systems that evolve on block chain. Maybe other block chain companies are going to win there. But what ultimately happens is they stamp -- they periodically stamp the truth back to Bitcoin block chain. That's what makes it immutable, and they can approve that all their systems have integrity. So, Bitcoin will always -- to me, will always have this foundational role in the crypto-economy, even if it's not what emerges as what -- you know, the transfer -- you know, as what the currency is. It will -- it just has this foundational sort of -- it is the protocol layer of this new world."
against,"The fatal flaw -- Go ahead. I was going to say, that requires a lot of leaps of faith. And I'm saying, there's nothing wrong with leaps of faith, but you've still got leaps of faith in Bitcoin world, which, I would say, even bigger than a leap of faith in central banks."
for,"No, no, no. No leap of faith at all. It's all transparent and immutable. With central banks, you're wondering what these mandarins are doing, looking into their crystal balls. This is -- when somebody comes up with a system, other side chains -- in fact, one has come out of the Bitcoin world called multi-chains -- that we like -- but there's other things, like, that evolve, like EOS and such, who knows. Anyway, they're these other platforms you're hearing. They all have ways where they can stamp back to Bitcoin that -- so there is never a leap of faith. The whole point is to try to create institutions where there's never a leap of faith you have to make on anybody. And there are corporate models that come out that ignore that, and the community shuns them. "
against,"The fatal flaw of Bitcoin -- even if you accept the crypto-currency as the currency of the future -- is the energy use, which Gillian mentioned before. So, currently, in a year, Bitcoin users use as much energy as the country of Colombia, which is a population of 50 million. If Bitcoin became as successful as you guys anticipate, the amount of energy use would be vastly more. Now, there are other crypto-currencies -- there are other crypto-currencies that have been designed to use less energy. So, even if you believe that crypto-currencies will be successful, it's not going to be Bitcoin."
for,"On that? Just -- -- that the Lord has delivered mine enemy into mine arms. There's a new coin called RavenCoin that is a fourth of Bitcoin. It is a fourth of Bitcoin -- so, what -- but no. It's a thousand times more energy-efficient, and it's a counterexample to what you're saying, Gillian, because with Bitcoin -- unlike Pets.com -- the system can evolve in this open, organic, open source method, and it has evolved the solutions. "
against,But it's a different coin.
for,"Well, no, it's an evolution. It's a fork of Bitcoin.  It's never really one or the other. Usually, the fiat currencies will try to adapt and they'll try to create a currency that -- well, first, they're trying to create currencies that are just tied to their government. And they've missed the entire purpose. But they'll start thinking, ""Hey, I want to create a global currency too."" And those governments will probably survive. But I -- in general, it's a better currency. It's just better. It's -- as the engineers work on it, make it so it's easier to transact business, to do -- to buy coffee, whatever -- this currency is going to be -- it's decentralized; it is flexible. It's cross-border. It's global. It's sort of everything you guys want as millennials. You want a world that's open -- -- and it's open."
against,"Bitcoin will be like traveler's checks. It will be like digital gold. It will be something, you know, of interest, part of the financial universe. But a side show. And it's certainly not going to turn into something that justifies the current bubble prices."
for,"So, I have here statements that I think you guys should hear. A rocket will never be able to leave the earth's atmosphere. New York Times, 1936. When the Paris Exhibition of 1878 closes, electric light will close with it and no more will be heard of it. Oxford Professor Erasmus Wilson. It'll be gone by June. This is Variety magazine talking about rock and roll in 1955. “The world potential for copying machines is 5,000 at most.” That's IBM avoiding buying Xerox. “The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to no one in particular?” That's the associates of David Sarnoff responding to the latter's call for investment in the radio in 1921. “There's no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.” Ken Olson , president of Digital Equipment Corporation, which is now gone. “Television won’t last, because people will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.” Twentieth Century Fox Darryl Zanuck in 1946. “The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty, a fad.” Didn't I hear that? President of Michigan Savings Bank advising Henry Ford's lawyer. “X-rays will prove to be a hoax.” That was 1883. “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” “This telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.” And then this is the real killer. The head of the Patent Office in 1899, Charles Duell, said, “Anything that can be invented has been invented.” So, you know, you're taking a tough position, you two. Please vote for Bitcoin. You don't want to be one of those guys."
against,"So, I hope you all saw how Tim changed the terms of the debate. He was talking about technologies rather than particular companies or particular instantiations of technology. So, we're talking here about Bitcoin. We're not talking here about cryptocurrencies generally, or the blockchain technology. Now, how about Bitcoin? What should we think of it? And it's helpful now to look at some data here. The technical term here, by the way, is not laissez, as Gillian said before. The technical financial term is scrappy , I believe. Okay, so, the actual Bitcoin transaction; how it long does it take? About 10 minutes. When there was high volume back last fall, it would take days. A credit card takes five seconds. How many merchants accept Bitcoin? Well, Patrick accepts Bitcoin.  “Bitcoin acceptance is virtually zero and shrinking,” as if that were possible. Top 500 online merchants last year, five; this year, three.  By contrast, virtually all merchants accept credit cards and cash and all other forms of currency. Why don't merchants accept Bitcoin? Because it fluctuates so much, right? So, if you're selling a valuable asset like a car that's worth $20,000 to you, and you get a bunch of bitcoins which lose half their value, unless you can get it off your hands as quickly as possible, you lose a ton of money. What are bitcoins good for? They're good for illegal transactions. As I mentioned before, a recent study says that 25 percent of Bitcoin users are associated with illegal activity. How much does a Bitcoin transaction cost? It's not free. It costs; varies across time. Right now, I think it's around a dollar per transaction. If you make -- if you buy something that's very, very big, Bitcoin is cheaper than a credit card, but you can still pay with credit -- with a check, a cashier's check, cash, which is free. The -- and then the upshot here is that Bitcoin is really not that good. What it's good for is illegal activity. Governments are obviously going to crack down on it. They've begun; China, India, the E.U., South Korea, the United States have all gone after Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin is a bubble. Vote no on the motion. The great central banker of our time Paul Volcker said in the 2008 eight crisis, “The last financial innovation that actually added any value to society was the ATM machine.” What he meant was all of these insanely complicated instruments that people go to school and go to Wall Street -- you know, they’re insanely complicated bets that no one can figure out by now. They've added nothing to society. They’ve added no value. Bitcoin does. Bitcoin does. The nineteenth century was a century of deflation and growth. Yes, there were financial crises. I believe the financial crises were brought about because of the legalization of fractional reserve banking and this way of letting our elites and -- overstimulate the economy and then crash and get bailed out by the government. The twentieth century was a period of inflation and crises. Inflation; so, a dollar's worth about two cents of what it was 100 years ago, and we've had crises just as profound as the nineteenth century and one worse, the crash of ’33, which was brought about by the central bankers. The real thing that -- the real value that Bitcoin brings to society --reminded of John Maynard Keynes spoke of the bezel -- the bezel -- that in society there's a bezel, and that is if you could freeze time and ask everyone what they thought they owned, and then you could see what's there, there’s a difference. And the difference is the amount that has been embezzled from society. It happens in different ways; there are different cheats built into the system. The institutions can't be trusted; that periodically bubbles to light. With a Bitcoin-based economy and a Bitcoin-based financial system where everything ties to that and records are immutable, it's going to be -- I think there's going to be less illegality. And by the way, the last time I checked, the U.S. dollar is used by gunrunners and dope runners and all that kind of stuff, too. nobody saying we’ve got outlaw that. But Bitcoin will reduce the bezel in our society, and it's here -- you're going to find, if nothing else, it has value, because things will anchor to it. And it's here to stay, and we should be grateful for that. Vote yes. When Paul Volcker said that the ATM was an amazing innovation, he said it was an amazing innovation because you could go to that hole in the wall and pull out dollars. Simple; fungible. You can take them anywhere; you can spend them. And on the dollar, there is a face or a series of faces and a promise by the government. And you might say, “You know what? That promise has been severely compromised and undermined by what the government's done.” Well, yes, maybe. But the question is really about relative faith. And the question is this: At least you can pick up a dollar, and you can see a face, and you know what stands behind it, which is the U.S. government. If you take a Bitcoin, you're betting on computers. You're betting on the idea that somehow, in this period of technological change, the first mover is going to always be there, unlike every single other period of technological change we've seen. Think of Myspace; think of those Walkman. But you're also betting on something else. If you ask who created Bitcoin: Satoshi Nakamoto. Well, who is he or she or they? Could you put them onto a dollar bill? Could you actually even create something as simple and easy as an ATM that Volcker loved so much?  So, the question is this: Would you rather bet on Volcker? Would you rather bet on something you can hold? Would you rather bet on the U.S. government, with all its flaws? Would you all rather bet on the competition of governments? If you don't like the U.S. government, go buy Swiss currency instead. Or would you rather find this Satoshi and bet on them? To me, it's about relative trust, and to me it's very clear. You should reject this motion."
for,"Well, I -- definitely, I'm open to the regulatory point of view, which basically -- I mean, when in doubt, err on the side of status quo. And that's okay, because I actually think this is so disruptive, I'm afraid -- I want to be for it, but I'm afraid of the transition. So, I'm -- the conservatives over there who want to move slowly or who doubt this world -- we can live with a little bit of conservatism."
against,It used to be the other way around.
for,"But I think the vision is the right vision. It's the optimistic vision. It's the vision of a future that is better than what we've got. And I think that's where -- and I did -- yeah, it was fun. I learned a lot about how to debate. This is my first debate ever. It was fun."
against,"Well, I'd agree that I think Professor Posner is probably the smartest -- not necessarily the briefest speaker, but the smartest speaker by. I would say that it's always great to be reminded afresh of the enthusiasm and passion that drives innovation. I may not that's really greed that the innovation is quite all it's presented as. I actually think, if anything, Bitcoin will have a leapfrog effect, which is why I think it's a bubble, but actually hearing the passion and innovation -- sorry, the passion and belief in innovation is always very refreshing in every sense."
