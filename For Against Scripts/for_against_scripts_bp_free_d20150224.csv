for,"Let me start by whisking you back to a magical time -- 2001. A conservative would have dismissed me as a liberal cliché . I was a floppy-haired, Burning Man regular, San Francisc -ite who turned down big law salaries to work for social justice . I had worked in refugee camps in Eastern Europe, for an environmental justice mentoring program in D.C., and for the ACLU of Northern California. And most of all, I loved the First Amendment, the quintessential liberal cause -- or so I thought. 2001 was also the year I started working at FIRE, which proudly defends speech and academic freedom for speakers of any political stripe . As soon as I started at FIRE, however, I was inundated with hundreds of pleas for help. It wasn't long before I learned this unfortunate truth : if you're going to be censored on the modern college campus for your opinion, chances ar e you're going to be censored by the Left. And this is what we mean by the Left, and most Americans mean when we say ""Liberal"" these days, either people on the left side of the political spectrum or people who self- identify as liberals, and people to thei r left. I have been -- I have seen so many crazy examples of politically -correct censorship. A student at Indiana punished just for publicly reading a book, a sorority sister forced to publicly repent for insensitivity for a Taco Tuesday event, and Yale students banned from calling Harvard students ""sissies"" on a t -shirt, which was a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald by the way . This is heartbreaking to me and my teammate, since both of us consider ourselves liberals . Of course there are many, q uote, good liberals out there who still support free speech, both on and off campus . These include former ACLU President Nadine Strossen, The Nation's Michelle Goldberg, renowned First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams, and many more . But one thing all of these liberals have in common is that they also believe that the campus liberals have become distressingly intolerant of dissent. Take any hot topic in America today and I can point you to examples of students and faculty members getting in trouble for being on the conservative side of the issue . Take abortion. While FIRE has proudly supported the free speech rights of pro -choice students, we are far more likely to have to come to the defense of pro -life students . How bad is it ? At Northern Kentucky University, a professor actually led her students to destroy a pro -life display . The display was only dozens of little white crosses to protest Roe V .  At Dartmouth, a similar pro -life display -- this time involving tiny American flags , was considered so offensive that another student ran it over with his car . That reckless censor -- have you any guess about what his politics were ? He had a COEXIST sticker on the back of his car .",nan
for,"Or take immigration . At UCLA, a student group faced ferocious protest and a massive fine when they simply attempted to invite someone to come to campus to debate against their pro -immigration stance . And though I'm an atheist, I have been horrified by repeated attempts to cens or campus evangelicals. Kirsten will tell you more about those cases. Last year, campus liberals made national headlines for demanding that speaker s they did not like be disinvited from campuses across the country . This problem has been growing for years . According to extensive research by FIRE, if you're going to face a disinvitation push arising from campus, it's about three times as likely it's going to come from your left . This is especially shocking when you consider how rare it is for a conservative to be invited in the first place . Last year's commencement season saw 25 Democratic political figures speech -- speak at the commencements of 60 of America's top universities . And how many Republicans were invited to speak ?  And this statistic comes from Nate Silver's decidedly non -conservative FiveThirtyEight website . Some conservatives were invited to talk at universities outside the top 60, including Rutgers . However, even there former Secretary of State Condoleezz a Rice bowed out after months of pressure from faculty and students . Even mild satire from conservatives isn't tolerated . Take the case of Omar Mahmoud, a Muslim conservative at the University of Michigan . When this past December, he wrote a satirical c olumn poking fun at micro aggressions and privilege theory -- very mild . He was not only fired from the student newspaper , but his dorm room door was vandalized . This prompted famous liberal writer Jonathan Chait to criticize the rise of a new wave of political correctness . If Angus and Jeremy concede that there is a problem with free speech on campus, they may blame the massive corporatized modern university . And on this we agree. Much of the censorship does come from out -of -control administrators . However, we must understand that liberals so thoroughly dominate the current academy, as Kirsten will show, that if they were serious about freedom of speech on campus, this kind of administrative outer -- overreach would no t be possible despite liberal dominance on campus or maybe because of it . 55 percent of over 400 colleges surveyed last year maintain wildly unconstitutional speech codes while only 4 percent maintain codes that fully meet First Amendment standar ds. And this in spite of nearly three dozen lawsuits against politically correct speech codes since 1989, successful lawsuits . And we can't forget that the tools that are most often to silence dissent on campus are the brain children of professors, i ncluding Katherine McKinnon, Mary Matsuda and Richard Delgado, all of whom were liberal leaders of the speech code movement in the 1980s . Though it gives me no joy to say it, you must vote in favor of the motion, y es, liberals do stifle intellectual diversity on campus. ",1.0
against," The picture that Greg drew is a common one . It is the conservative picture of the modern university . Perhaps best summarized by former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum who called universities ""indoctrination mills."" In this picture, we are -- higher education is infused with an overly liberal professoriate, biased classrooms and stifled campus debate. If this picture is true, it is indeed very serious . If it is an accurate portrait of higher education in America, then we should all be alarmed, and we should all donate money to Greg's group . Is it, though? I will handle those first two, are professors liberal? And why ? Is the classroom a biased place ? And mostly leave the third to Angus . So, are professors liberal? Well, yes. When we did the research, a national random sample survey for our book, we found that 61 percent of college professors are left or liberal. But this is nothing new . The very first time we looked at college professors in a structured survey in 1933, we found almost the same number. So , it isn't like the '60s : radicals all went into faculty positions and moved young minds to the left. So, why -- what explains this ? Well, the conservative explanation for the overwhelming liberal campus is simple: Conservatives are squeezed out of grad school, convinced that their ideas aren't w orthy of a PhD. And those few that escape this thought police then find it very hard to get a job because liberals discriminate and won’t hi re conservatives . And then those few conservatives that get through this gauntlet are denied tenure by bitter liberal colleagues. This simplyis not so . When we surveyed faculty members, 85 percent argued that ideology played no role in tenure in their department. And this was true of 87 percent of conservatives we surveyed , so -- of the very conservative . So, it is not the case that conservatives need not apply for jobs . Why aren't there more conservative professors to fight the good fig ht? Well, the first answer I ’d give you is money . If you are someone who believes in the market uber alles , you might want to make more than $29 .5 k, which is what I made my first year as a young college professor in 1996 . If you work four years for a PhD like I did, you might think you deserve something better . That's what we got. So , I think the market keeps conservatives from wanting to be in the academy . I also think there's a pocketbook issue here . Professors depend on two sources of government for their income . One is those many professors like myself who work for state government. If conservatives win, you may not get a raise for four years . And a lot of professors also work on federal grants . The Republican party is not the Republican party of 1955, which was very supportive of higher education. It is a party that is devoted to cutting government spending . We aren't surprised when oil executives vote Republican. It's in their economic interest . The same is true for college professors. We also have seen the conservative movement have a hostility to science which it didn't have 40 years ago . So , in our survey, we found, contrary to earlier ones, that natural science professors were moving to the left. 18:22: 24 Well, if a party attacks evolution, you're going to lose a lot of natural and social scientists because we happen to believe in the scientific method. It's good politics for Republicans . I give them that. There's a lot more people who think the worl d was created in seven days than people with PhDs . So it's a good move, but it h urts them on college campuses . There's also another thing that we found is conservatives on college campuses are pretty much like other professors . They're also very, very p ro gay rights. While one party has embraced that social movement, the other party is fairly fervently against it . So , that is again moving professors away from any tendencies to be Republican or conservative . Finally, an anti-intellectualism is occupyin g certain wings of the Republican party . It used to be that that was more the Democrats that were anti -intellectual . Anyone remember George Curly Wallace ? When George Wallace ran for president as an I ndependent after being a Democrat, he almost got no faculties’ support -- in '68 . The inheritors of the Wallace movement today are in the Republican party . It is that kind of anti -intellectualism that turns off college professors . So, I don't think that college professors are becoming liberal out of a viewpoint discrimination . Is theclassroom biased against conservatives ? I would argue no, that if you ask students, do you feel that your viewpoints aren't welcome on your college camp us? In survey after survey, the majority of students say no . So , I think this portrait of an overly liberal campus can be discredited with Greg's own research, that in his work where he identified the 12 worst campuses in 2013, and he said, ""These are ex amples of liberal viewpoint discrimination, conservatives being squelched."" Well, in fact, of the 12, three were nonpolitical, entirely conservative, small “c” conservative administrators just saying, “O h, I don't want people talking about sex on my campus . We might lose donations .” Three of them were conservatives squelching liberals . And finally, there were four of the classic where liberals were being -- were squelching conservatives . There is a place in this very city where I would not be allowed to speak on any topic at a ll. It's Catholic University . Catholic University, like many conservative campuses, is very explicit about not allowing liberals to speak . I'm not exactly a liberal, but I am pro choice . Catholic Universit y has an official policy: No one who has ever publicly advocated for the right to abortion is allowed to speak.  ",1.0
for," Thanks to Intelligence Squared for doing a debate on such an important topic . And I'm always happy t o be anywhere where Bill O'Reilly can't interrupt me, so I'm happy to be here . Our opponents are telling you that liberals are not stifling intellectual diversity on campuses . Sadly, this could not be further from the truth. A perfect example of this is a 2013 case that happened at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, where I'm from. My parents were professors there . A feminist professor filed multiple sexual harassment complaints against the student university -- the campus university there -- because of an April Fool’s Day issue of an article that was mildly mocking feminism. The professor filed another complaint after the newspaper published an article that was critical of hate speech. The university's repeated investigations dragged on for almost nine months and -- and it only really ended when FIRE had intervened an d informed them they were violating the First Amendment . Ironically, the editor- in-chief, who wrote this article, was herself a feminist and thought she was doing a very mild , mocking , April Fool’s Day story . And she told F IRE that the chilling investigation that was launched by the University of Alaska prevented her from publishing stories on important issues, including sexual assault . Recently, at Milwaukee's Marquette University, a political science professor t here, John McAdams, blogged about an exchange where a Marquette philosophy professor had told a student that debating gay marriage in class was, quote, ""not appropriate and homophobic."" For this, Marquette suspended the professor, McAdams , who blogged about it, banned him from campus, and they are now in the process of trying to revoke his tenure . Greg and I both support gay marriage, but this is an extremely chilling way for Marquette to handle this issue . As Jeremy acknowledged, the decks are stacked against those who express non -liberal views on campuses . And I would just point out, to the point that campuses have always been liberal, liberals are very -- liberals -- the liberals in the past actually supported free speech, and I think that would be the big difference of today, is that the liberals that we're talking about today are enacting very hostile policies against free speech . And so there's a big difference . They may be voting for the same people, but they are behaving in a very different way . And many studies will back up the fact that there are vastly more liberals on campuses . There was one study that found that 72 percent of college professors identify as liberal , while only 15 percent identify as conservative . It's gotten so bad that several prominent social psychologists have written an article recently arguing that the field of psychology is being badly hurt by the lack of political diversity . One of the papers -- and, by the way, none of them are conservatives who wrote this -- one of the paper's authors is NYU Professor Jonathan Haidt. At a 2011 social psychologist symposium, he asked the audience to show hands for their political leanings . Out of a thousand people only three rai sed their hands to say that they were conservative . And Haidt points out that, of course, there were more conservatives in the audience -- that can't be the actual ratio -- but they were too afraid to identify themselves, which speaks for itself. He expl ained that this gross political and ideological disparity is evidence of a, quote, ""tribal moral community that actively discourages conservatives from entering."" He explained that there were -- in preparing for his speech, he wanted to talk to some non -liberal graduate students . He was able to only identify two in the -- of social psychology graduate students, and that he said that he -- they reminded him of closeted gays from the 1980s . And he referred to them as ""closeted conservatives"" because they were -- they felt that they were forced to hide their identities and -- from their colleagues and from their professors, and it really affected the research that they did . And so Haidt argued that more ideological diversity would lead to, quo te, ""better science and freer thinking."" The ideological slant, it's not just a passive preference . During the 2012 election, 96 percent, which is almost 100 percent as we all know, of political contributions from Ivy League faculty and staff went to the Obama campaign . And during the 2004 election, professors donated $19 to John Kerry's campaign for every dollar that went to George Bush. And as sociologist Neil Gross has pointed out, o ur colleges and our universities are one -party campuses. Last year at the University of California at Santa Barbara, one of the worst cases probably that we'll talk about tonight, a feminist professor's study -- she was found guilty of grand theft, vandali sm, and battery after a physical altercation in which she stole and destroyed a 16 -year -old pro -life demonstrator's sign . The professor claimed she was triggered by the poster's graphic images, called the demonstrators ""terrorists,"" and told police she had a moral right to her behavior and was just setting a good example . She still has a job and was basically defended by scores of professors. We've also seen discrimination against Christian groups on campuses – it’s getting much worse at Vanderbilt . Fourteen campus groups lost their organizational status in 2012 because they wanted to choose their own leaders based on religious belief. A nd there are just many more campus fellowship groups from University of -- State University of New York or the Cal State system who've lost -- have been driven off campus . And, you know, Harvard Professor and former Obama administration appointee Cass Sunstein has warned that when a group becomes ideologically homogenous, it tends to drift farther and farther in that direction and become more hostile to outsiders. But it's reason . ",1.0
against," My adversaries have made some really cogent points this evening, and so as an actual campus Leftist, I look forward to denouncing them as bigots . But before I do that, I'd like to take a step back and talk a little bit about the campus . What the actual, average American campus is like today . The American campus today, as it has been in the past, is a site of robust and passionate debate . And that's true not only because it's a place of learning, but also because it is a haven for young people . And the reality is that most of us, a t some point in our lives, give up on debating people we profoundly disagree with . We decide that it's too hard, it's too uncomfortable, it doesn't usually work. And so, we give up . But college students haven't given up yet. And so, they argue, incessantly and angrily . But here's the thing. In my experience, on campuses across the country -- and this is backed up by my opponent's o wn data -- where free speech is curtailed on campus, it's overwhelmingly not by students or campus liberals, but by administrators who are motivated not by ideology, but by opposition to disruptiveness and clamor. A perfect example of this is a case that many critics of campus leftism and campus liberalism have talked abo ut -- the case of Robert Birgeneau , the former chancellor of the University of California Berkeley, who, as Berkeley chancellor, presided over the arrests of dozens of peaceful, non- violent student protestors on multiple occasions, including one occasion in 2011, where students who were demonstrating peacefully were beaten viciously by campus police with batons . After he stepped down as Berkeley's chancellor, Birgeneau was invited to give a commencement address at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. And some Haverford students were understandably not so happy about this . So, what did they do ? Did they burn down the building ? Did they lock him out? Did they beat him with batons ?  They did none of those things . What they did is write a letter. They wrote a long letter expressing their concerns in which they offered suggestions for how he could repair the harm that he had done to civil liberties at Berkley . And they urged -- that was their word -- ""urged"" him -- to -- as they put it, ""confront the issues be fore you."" If he didn't do that, they said, they would ask the college to withdraw his invitation, a request that they had no power to enfor ce. In a two -line reply, Birgeneau said that he would not respond to what he called their “violent verbal attacks. ""  He wouldn't meet with them . He wouldn't respond to the claims that they had made . He wouldn't debate them . And in fact, he wouldn't even come to their campus . He withdrew his decision to come and speak at their commencement. Now, FIRE has written about this incident many times . Op-ed writers all over the country have written about this incident. And every time they do, Birgeneau -- an administrator who presided over the beating and arrest of student protestors -- isportraye d as a free speech martyr. Well, the students who had just wanted to talk to him about that -- are portrayed as his oppressors . And I say that that is absolutely wrong . I say that is absolutely backwards . Now, I'm not asking you to embrace every argume nt made by every member of the campus Left, because frankly, some of their arguments are really bad arguments . But speech that nobody opposes is not speech that needs protecting . And there's a recurring tactic that we see in critics of the campus Left in which students who are engaging in free speech are condemned as violent or condemned as censors . And you know, hyperbole is free speech, whether it's the hyperbole of students calling a speaker who said something unfortunate a racist or the hyperbole of an administrator calling a polite letter a violent attack . Demonizing your opponents is free speech . But so is refusing to demonize them . And that's what I'm asking you to do today . I want you to vote against this motion, because it's not liberals who are stifling free speech on the American campus, but bureaucrats . Bureaucrats who are scared by the rowdy, messy vitality of the marketplace of ideals -- ideas . So, what I'm asking you to do here is to stand up for free speech on campus -- the freedom of speech of the Left and the Right and the Center by voting against this ill -conceived and prejudicial motion . And I'd just like to close by saying one thing . A few days ago we lost a champion of speech and debate and dialogue in this country, David Carr, who wrote for the New York Times. And on the stage at the Intelligence Squared debate s a couple years ago, he said something that I would just like to quote to you now . He said, ""I urge you to vote against, against, against this motion which is per se dumb."" ",1.0
against,"Oh, yeah, sorry. I will do that . That's right, you are -- you are my actual audience as well as ""the"" audience . So, okay, so the folks who have drawn up these speech codes are for the most part not intending to impose ideological conformity . They are trying to keep trustees happy, they are trying to keep alumni happy . They are trying to avoid having parents feel like their kids who they think of as still children are living in a den of iniquity . And so there is certainly a tremendous amount of pressure from the top to keep things calm on the campus . But that's a very different thing than an attempt to impose ideological conformity . And in fact, in the 2015 speech code report that Fire just produced, they cite that the setting aside speech c odes which are not currently being enforced, they cite 15 examples of freedom of speech violations and 12 of those are nonideological, things like people getting -- students getti ng written up for passing out constitutions on campus . That's not anti - conservative. -- that’s anti -free speech.John Donvan: -- your opponents respond to it. Who would like to take that?",2.0
for,"I'll -- I think I can start with that. I mean, it was interesting to have your own research sort of cited, because when we watch how these codes are written, you know, as I said, they came from liberal thinkers, they came from the C atherine MacKinnons. They are used disproportionally against conservative points of view consistently . And the idea that, yes, absolutely, administrators are largely the big problem, and they have been, and I'd be willing to say that. But the administrators themselves lean overwhelmingly left . It's 96 percent donations to the Obama campaign came from --when you take staff and faculty together . So, they're using the same tools . And just -- and I really have to say, the -- I have seen genuinely heartbreaking case of things that you should never do to people coming from administrators that are very much left. There was the University of Wisconsin case where they were telling a student he couldn't have a Bible study meeting in his own room on his own time because people knew he wa s an Evangelical Christian . They might find that offensive . Again, I'm an atheist, but that's wrong.",2.0
against," Well, I thin k one of the things that we need to look at here is what are the circumstances in which students who are not conservatives, who are being caught up in these . And I think honestly, I think, yes, you can say that they were probably liberal in their political views, but they were centrist in their views about what is appropriate discussion and debate on campus . And here's an example of it . There was a case recently where two students who were joking around with each other and one of them was whi te, and one of them was black, and one of them -- the white said to the black one, ""Can I get a white power?"" And this was a joke that they had between themselves . And neither one of them was offended by it . And they were both brought up on charges beca use the kind of humor that they were engaging was found offensive by the administration. Now, is that suppression of conservative speech ? Is it suppression of liberal speech ?  It's just a jerk administrator being a jerk.",2.0
for," The point isn't that it's always conservatives . I don't -- that's not actually our position .

So, if you're those students that you just described, and you're on a campus where you think you're going to get in trouble for a private conversation which we have a lot of -- you know the stories too . There are a lot of storie s like this. You are going to be very careful about what you say . And that is going to stifle intellectual diversity if people feel like I can't say something . At Marquette University, there was another case where -- in their training of the professors, they had a slide that said to the professors -- it was an example of something that they might have to respond to . Two students are talking . They oppose same -sex marriage . They're talking about how they oppose same -sex marriage . A third student overhe ars them and reports them to the administration . They were told this was the proper handling of this incident. They're turning -- they're turning students into informants on each other for having a conversation.

And this is why you should always be concerned about calls for civility . He points out that civility ends up getting defined by the people who are in charge . And you'll notice that when people argue for civility, they tend to actually believe that whatever they say is civil. And if they' re angry about it, it's righteous rage . But if you say it and it's kind of sharp or mean, then it's incivil . And this -- this is the one of the reasons why it is a problem that you have this incredible sort of liberal d ominance on campus, is that you end up actually seeing, in some cases, what your point of view is as a -- and anybody opposing as being fundamentally uncivil .

But, any time a liberal -- any time a campus does anything, i t's usually liberals doing it.

for,"And I should like to point out in -- J eremy Mayer: The first example in Greg's excellent book is a student protesting a garage being built from an environmentalist perspective, saying why are we doing this ? And the university president, I don't know if he's a liberal or a conservative . I know nothing about that president. But he went after that student in and egregious way . And I appreciate that Fire supported that guy because I'm glad somebody did. But it was not a conservative student standing up and saying, ""Build more garages because burning carbon's good."" It was a liberal student being punished for being stridently environmentalist. Kirst en Powers: I just -- I just -- I'm going to reiterate again that it is not our argument that it is only conservatives or even that it's -- that it's necessarily an ideological crusade, though it often is . The point is intellectual diversity is being -- is being stifled and that -- and it does -- and when you -- when you do it to a liberal or whether you do it to a conservative or do it to an agnostic, it creates a culture of fear and makes it impossible for people to speak openly. John Donvan:I'm curious also, are you saying that this stifling stems primarily or only from the administration.   I think -- I me an, we haven't talked about a lot of cases where it actually doesn't have anything to do with the administr ators. It has the -- the Kaminer, that was derived completely from students . In fact, the administrator that the president of Smith was there when it happened and -- and it really wasn't that much of an incident. It was something that came from students, and students who then started protesting and demanding, you kno w, that the president of Smith condemn this and all these other things. So, I think you see it with Bill Maher, same thing . You know, it was a student -led revolt against him for his comments about Islam. These were, again, from the left .

against," I think it -- I think it is a very important question as -- -- I understand it, it has to do with leadership roles . So, certain campuses have a rule that says, any student organization has to have an open membership and open leadership voting which produces the odd outcome that you could have a Christian group of a small group of st udents that a group of malicious 19 years old, who were really jerky atheists could join the group and take it over. And so some campus groups have said, ""We'd like to have our bylaws that said the leader of the campus Christian crusade needs to be an Eva ngelical Christian,"" right? How do we resolve that ? I don't know, but I would not be in favor of booting Christian groups off campus . I think that is a violation of free speech as well. It's because the campus has an organization that -- campuses are trying to keep the student KKK group from founding . So, in order to keep white Aryan groups from forming that would not admit black students, they try to write campus rules that would make every student group open to members of all races and religions and beliefs . But when you do that, you create a problem for some Christian groups if an angry group of other believing students want to join their group .",2.0

She's an evangelical Christian student trying to get her degree in social work at Missouri State University. She's an evangelical, and she doesn't believe in gay marriage, and she doesn't believe in gay adoption . She was told to do an activity where she would actually act gay in public, which she pretended she did, as part of her degree, and then she said, ""I'm never doing this again."" She put on her big boy pants, as it were, when she was asked to sign a petition as part of her class supporting gay adoption. She fundamentally did not believe this was right . She said she wouldn't, and they brought h er into the room, and they threatened her basically with being kicked out of the program unless she actually changed her point of view, unless she decreased the distance -- the difference between her and the administration. There was a full investigation of this . It was absolutely horrible, the extent to which they were intolerant of an evangelical Christian's belief . But she did fight. Then there's also E d Felkner, who was told he had to -- he actually had to -- he had to lobby for liberal causes at Rhode Island College or else not graduate .

Yes, students at Santa Barbara suggested that it should be mandatory, but students suggest things that are not that great of an idea all the time . And in fact, in fact, the student who was behind -- one of the students who was behind the proposal at Santa Barbara wrote to me privately much later, saying that she thought that my solution was an excellent one, and she thought that the way that I had approac hed it, which was not mandatory, had advanced the debate in exactly the way she wanted it to be.

for,"This evening, Kirsten and I have provided data and real examples demonstrating how liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus . But you don't have to take it from us . Just ask the professors themselves . In a 2012 study, a representative sample of about 300 social psychologists were asked if two job candidates with equal qualifications were to apply for an opening in your department, and you knew one was politically conservative, would you be inclined to vote for the more liberal one ? 82 percent of liberal social psychologists said they would at least be a little bit prejudice against the conservative applicant . This is shocking, especially when you consider that social psychologists are so o ften concerned about the harm of unconscious bias . It can be very hard to get respondents to concede that they might be prejudice . Not -- not so apparently with conservatives and Christians . It's a well -known rule of social science that the more politically homogenous a group is, the more radical in that direction it tends to become and the more the group begins to act as a tribe that sees outsiders as enemies who are either stupid or simply bad or greedy . Unfortunately, we're seeing this pl ay out within our colleges and universities . Too many liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus and in doing so, they are encouraging people just to talk with those who they already agreed . There are endless rules for collect speech -- corre ct speech are encouraging people to keep their opinions to themselves . This only makes the tribalism problem worse and the walls of the echo chamber thicker. It's not supposed to be this way, and it doesn't have to be this way . But the first step toward s recovery is admitting you have a problem. And on our campuses, we have a problem.

There are things that you go through with a Libertarian -minded Republican that I sympat hize with. But I don't believe, overall, that liberals are stifling intellectual kinds of diversity . I think a lot of these ideas, even the idea of trigger warning s are creating discussions about trauma and how we talk about it. When I was at college, my first month, a gay student group had a kiss -in in the mailroom. And back in -- '80 -- and today that's pretty normal at GW . That happens a lot of -- Thursd ay I think is the gay kiss -in . But in '86, that was revolutionary to see boys or men and men and women and women kissing deeply . It really created a discussion . That's free speech. And was it offensive, was it dangerous ? Did people -- yeah . But that's what a campus should be . A lot of the things we've heard tonight are anecdotes . The plural of anecdote is not data . There are things that happen on college campus es that I don't approve of, that I don't think a good liberal or for someone committed to free speech should a pprove of. But you know what ? That's what happens when 18 and 21 -year -olds are passionate about their beliefs and they engage in a debate that we must desperately have . So , at the end of the day, I think a lot of conservatives are worried that their children are g oing to change to the left. And I have good news, we don't change children to the left. Jennings and Stoker in a longitudinal study found that college had absolutely no effect on political views of college students . Mariani and Hewitt found a small leftw ard change over time in college students that was exactly mirrored by what happened with the same age group that didn't go to college .

for,"If you're part of the dominant culture, which, on university campuses -- as we've established -- is primarily liberal -- it's easy to mistake your beliefs for objective truth . It's also easy to imagine there are no reasonable or intelligent people who think differently on important topics, because you're not encountering them . I know this because I've lived most of my life in the liberal bubble . There were two experiences that took me out of this . One was becoming a contributor at Fox News . And the other was a later in life conversion to Christianity . I can remember actually saying to somebody that I was debating at Fox that Harriet Miers -- who George Bush was -- had nominated for the Supreme Court -- didn't count as a female appointment, because she was a conservative and an evangelical Christian . I'm embarrassed, frankly, that I ever thought that . It was a prejudiced view, and unfortunately, I wasn't alone in my prejudice . A 2007 study of faculty on college campuses found that 53 percent had cool or negative feelings towards evangelical Christians . These levels of disapproval raise curious questions about how evangelical students are treated on campus . The onl y way that one could believe that liberals aren't stifling intellectual diversity on campuses is if they never visit FIRE's website and if they don't have any friendships with non- liberals. At a dinner party a couple weeks ago, I met a retired Stanford pr ofessor and a Harvard Law School student -- both evangelicals -- who described to me how they felt they had to hide their beliefs, lest they be ostracized or punished. A third person, who was a former professor at a DC area university, was pass ed over for a position because she was suspected -- correctly -- of being a conservative . And this was in writing . These stories are all too familiar. I hear them regularly, but people are too afraid to speak publicly .

But the other thing that it did is it made me think more seriously about what I was going to say . It made me chew on the stuff. And sometimes I did think seriously about what I was going to say, and I still said something that offended somebody else . And they let me know it. And here I am today, still alive , still doing okay . Part of free speech on campus is people being passionate about the degree to which they abhor what you say . I absolutely think that we need more free speech on campus when we're talking about administrators, and faculty imposing their own values, whether ideological or not . But I also absolutely think that we need to stand up for the right for people to engage in rowdy, obnoxious debate, because rowdy, obnoxious debate is what made me what I am and it's what made a lot of you what you are .
