for,"Probably a slight advantage. Economists are definitely much more pro-immigration than most Americans, but economists also don't like to be extreme. I'm an exception. Vivek Wadhwa, god of Twitter. John, I wouldn't have had a choice. I couldn't get a visa. We will close the doors. We'd lock the borders. We're turning away brilliant people because of our flawed immigration policies. So I would have had to leave. I'm here now."
against,"Ron Unz. Well, I guess we'll find out when the vote takes place."
for,"Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere. Given current policy, it does sound radical. But notice, the resolution does not say ""Let Anyone Become a Citizen Anywhere.” The resolution does not say ""Let Anyone Collect Government Benefits Anywhere.” The respondent does not say ""Let Anyone Vote Anywhere.” The resolution only says that no matter where you're born, it should be legal for you to accept a job offer from a willing employer. The resolution parallels -- let any woman take a job anywhere, or let any Jew take a job anywhere, or let any black take a job anywhere. The resolution is not a request for charity and it is not a demand for government help. It simply asks the world'sgovernments to stop requiring discrimination against foreign workers. But most arguments focus on high-skilled, high-tech workers. I outsourced this topic to my partner, Vivek Wadhwa. I'm going to focus on the vast majority of would-be immigrations who aren't high-skilled or high-tech.   Mexican gardeners.  Now, why on earth shouldn't we require discrimination against such people? Who would want them? You know, the same reason that we shouldn't require discrimination against women, against Jews, or against blacks. They're fellow human beings. And they count. Now, suppose the world's governments made it illegal for Ron to work anywhere but Haiti. Would that be morally acceptable, to trap Ron in Haiti for the rest of his life? Mandatory discrimination against foreigners is especially awful, because most of the world's workers earn vastly more in the first world than they ever could at home. Moving from Haiti to Miami increases your wages by about 20 times. That is not plus 20 percent. That is not plus 200 percent. That is plus 2,000 percent. Now, you could object that we're not obliged to help total strangers. You know, you'll say -- but the important point is, remember, allowing someone to take a job is not charity. Let me repeat that. Allowing someone to take a job is not charity. What is it? It's call minimal decency. So, suppose that Kathleen were to get a job. If I refrain from slashing her car tires on her first day of work, that does not make me a philanthropist. I am not starting the ""Save Kathleen Newland Fund"" when I don't vandalize her car. I'm merely leaving Kathleen alone. Now, sometimes tragically, just leaving someone alone has enormous costs. For example, if someone has bubonic plague, a quarantine really is the lesser evil. If you leave the person with bubonic plague free to roam, he could kill millions of people. Would open borders wreck comparable harm on our economy?  Every scholarly estimate of the economic effects of open borders finds enormous overall benefits. Economist Michael Clemens, the world's expert on this topic, finds that a free global labor market would roughly double global production. Now, this point he makes -- double, how is it possible to double global production? Well, consider this thought experiment. Imagine there were a billion farmers stuck in Antarctica farming the snow. All right. I don't know a lot about farming, but it sounds tough. All right. Now, suppose we were to let these billion farmers move from Antarctica to anywhere else. Anywhere with decent soil, decent weather, decent conditions. Well, obviously, the billion Antarcticans would be way better off when they get to leave Antarctica. But they are hardly the only beneficiaries. The other beneficiaries ofallowing them to leave Antarctica are everyone on earth who eats food, everyone on the -- everyone on earth who eats food benefits from that greater availability of food. Now, economically speaking, Haiti and Bangladesh really are like Antarctica. They're countries where workers realize only a small sliver of their full potential. Ask yourself this: What is the best job that you could get in Bangladesh? Not very good. Now, wouldn't open borders hurt American workers?  Take me. I am a native born college professor. Thanks to a massive immigration loophole, virtually any PhD in the world can legally compete with me in the U.S. labor market. As a result, about half of all U.S. research professors are foreign born. This has slashed my wages and my career prospects. Right now, there is probably an immigrant sitting at Harvard in the office that is supposed to be mine. Now, is my sad, sad story a good argument for immigration restrictions? Sure, it's a great argument.  No, it's a terrible argument. Professorial immigration is bad for me, but it's good for consumers of education. If you're glad that you didn't pay even more for your college education, thank an immigrant. The same goes for every occupation. Immigration of waiters is bad for native born waiters, but it's good for diners. Immigration of gardeners is bad for native born gardeners, but it's good for homeowners. So how on earth could we ever judge the overall effect? There is a very simple answer. Keep both eyes firmly on production. Keep both eyes firmly on production. When global production doubles, your standard of living is very likely to rise. This is not trickle-down economics. It is Niagara Falls economics. Now, what about the endless, noneconomic complaints about immigration? I'm sure we'll get into an enormous number as we go on. So I will just give you a general rule for how I respond to all of them. Here is the rule: For any complaint you have, there is a cheaper and more human main remedy than mandatory discrimination against foreigners. Immigrants have used the welfare state. Let them work, but not collect benefits. Immigrants damage the environment. Let them work but tax their pollution. Immigrants vote the wrong way, let them work but not vote. Immigrants hurt well-skilled Americans. Let them work but charge immigrants an admission fee or a surtax. Then use those funds to compensate native workers who lose out. If you think theseremedies are unfair, they are certainly less unfair than turning honest workers into criminals just because they were born in the wrong country. To conclude, let -- Let anyone take a job anywhere. It is the right way to treat your fellow human beings. It will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing. "
against,"I'll admit, when I was first approached with this topic, the resolution being, “Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere,"" I thought the idea was so crazy it would be very hard to get anybody lined up on the other side. But obviously we've found a couple of intelligent people to do that. Let's think a little bit about what this means. Now, you know, I'm laboring under a disadvantage in this debate because not only am I not a trained economist, I've never even taken a class in economics. I've never even opened an economics textbook. I personally don't claim to really understand most economics. I'm not convinced everybody else understands economicsthat well either. But one part of economics that is very well-established, a very simple issue, is the law of supply and demand. Think of what production means. The two main factors in production are labor and capital. Together, those factors produce everything we have in our society. Allowing an unlimited number of additional workers from everywhere in the world to come here and take jobs would massively, massively increase the supply of labor. The result would be tremendously disadvantaging labor at the expense of capital. In effect, order workers, ordinary citizens, people basically who work for a living would be tremendously economically disadvantaged by the fact that they would be competing against a billion, 2 billion, 3 billion, an unlimited supply of additional foreign workers who would take the job for whatever wage they could. It's true, certainly, there would be a huge increase in economic production, productivity, GNP. But almost all of it, and possibly even more than all of it would be captured by capital, captured by the wealthy people on that side of the equation. In other words, what we're talking about is something that would be very beneficial for the top 1 percent, .1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, the wealthiest segment of American society. They would benefit, no doubt about it. Everybody else would suffer. I think that's very clear, because when you're talking about basically a hundred million or 150 million American workers, suddenly competing in an open labor market with a billion or 2 billion or 3 billion impoverished people from everywhere else in the world, they certainly would suffer. Now, let's think of what really has happened in American society over the last 20, 30, 40 years. The late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, over 20 years ago, pointed out that for two decades there had been no increase in average wage income in the United States. The standard of living of ordinary American workers had been stagnant for two decades. He said that 20 years ago. It's now been 40 years. The income of the average American has been stagnant or declining for 40 years now, which is a shocking statistic that most people are not aware of. Clearly, there have been advances in technology so that in many ways people have a much better life than they did before with iPhones, with Google, with things like that. But in terms of real income, people are basically the same or poorer than they were decades ago. And as Moynihan pointed out in the '90s, that's the longest period of economic stagnation that has happened in North America since European settlement began hundreds of years ago. Now, is it entirely coincidence that 40 years of economic stagnation for ordinary American workers is the same 40 years that has seen one of the highest rates of foreign immigration to the United States in our history? I think it's morethan a coincidence. The point is, if you have a huge influx of willing workers from abroad, able to take any job they could because they come from poor countries, you're going to drive down the wages of ordinary American workers who are competing with them. Allowing anyone to take a job anywhere in effect would convert America's minimum wage into its maximum wage. And if you see the complaints right now over the 1 percent, over the wealthy elite who have tremendously benefited in the last few decades, while ordinary people, ordinary people in New York City or other places around the country have suffered, that would be tremendously exacerbated if you brought in tens or even hundreds of millions of impoverished workers from other countries to take their places. Now, the point is, when you're talking about the result of economic stagnation in the United States that has now gone on for 40 years for ordinary workers, the end result at some point may be severe political backlash. And that sort of thing is inevitable. The reason America in its history, largely avoided the disastrous political results of many European countries is that every decade Americans were wealthier and better off than they were before. That's no longer true today. And it's no longer been true for 40 years now. Allowing an unlimited number of impoverished foreign workers to come to the United States would obviously make that situation incredibly much worse. And the result would be an economic disaster. It's true that possibly 1 percent or 2 percent or even 5 percent of Americans would benefit tremendously from that change. But probably 90 percent of the American population would suffer economically. And they are the people who vote. They are the people who can protest. And their views would certainly be made known. And the result would be tremendous political backlash. We have to ask ourselves whether one reason for many of the problems we've had in the last few decades economically is because the glorification, the amplification of theoretical concepts that may look very good to pure economic theorists, people basically spend their time in the ivory tower, but don't understand that ordinary workers suffer when their incomes don't rise for 40 years. And I think, unfortunately, that's probably true today. One other aspect of the American political dynamic has been that there's an increasing centralization of politics in the hands of wealth; in other words, the people who fund the campaigns, the organizations that fund the campaigns. And when you have the wealthy people benefiting tremendously from a proposal like this, and everybody else suffering. But when the wealthy people fund the politicians, they fund the think tanks, they fund the universities, they fund the journals; it's not toosurprising that some of these ideas become very common in such circles even if the end result would be disastrous for the United States. The bottom line is that letting anyone take a job anywhere might sound good in theory but it would destroy the United States and destroy the lives of ordinary workers. "
for,"You know, I've read Ron's writings. I've watched his videos. And that's not the Ron that I've read. The Ron that I've read about is not one of these Tea Party anti-immigrant people who goes around creating fear about the billions who are going to invade America and take away our jobs and so on. Those are the debates that are happening in Washington, D.C. by a small segment of Congress, which has been elected through a gerrymandered electorate. That is not the real world. That is not how Americans think. The fear we've had about Mexicans coming in and taking our jobs away, they're -- and then Indians coming in and taking our jobs away, they've not been founded. Now, Bryan explained what's happening in the unskilled sector. I've been researching systematically what's happening in the skilled sector, because you have the same fear mongering happening in skilled immigration, that, ""My God, these Indians, they're going to come and take our jobs away. If we expanded which one be the American workers, we all be unemployed."" The exact opposite is happening. America is the most competitive land in the world. We have reinvented ourselves over and over again. Diversity rules over here.  It is diverse as could possibly be. The economy is thriving. People are doing much better.Look at the benefits we've seen from technology, all of the advances that Ron talked about, our iPhones, our Googles. The fact is the world is connected right now. We have more knowledge than we've ever had. Knowledge has become free. It used to be that if you needed to get information about your health you had to go to your doctor. That's it. Now you just Google and download apps and you have medical information readily at your fingertips. That happened because of technology. And you know who's been building these technologies? Immigrants, 52 percent of the startups in Silicon Valley during the most innovative period in recent economic history were founded by immigrants, people like me, people like this audience, people who came here because they saw opportunity, they were highly educated, and they decided to bring their knowledge and their intelligence with them over here and make America a competitive place. This is what's made this land what it is. In every generation there were people like -- I mean this is not Ron. I mean I could have -- I've heard his -- actually I've seen his writing. This was not -- I don't believe what he just said over here. Every generation -- -- in every generation there have been people who said that ""If we let these Irish in, if we let these Poles in, if we let these Jews in, if we let these people in our jobs will go away."" And guess what happened? These immigrants made Americans work harder, think smarter, compete, and this became the only innovative economy in the world. We lead the world because of innovation, because we open our borders, and because we allow people to come in here. Now, that's one perspective. The other perspective is that I hate to tell you this but the cat is already out of the bag. How many of you check email when you go home? All of you do.  Now, when you go on vacation, do you check email? All of you do. Well, most of you do. Let’s say you decided to work for six months in South America and your job was highly --a knowledge job, as are many jobs increasingly right now, you'd be working from anywhere. Therefore, anyone else could work from anywhere as well. You know, this is getting a little bit off topic, but the point I wanted to make was that already we are in a borderless economy when it comes to knowledge. We are in a knowledge economy. Knowledge jobs can be done anywhere. Boeing has engineers working in four or five different countries at the same time, designing aircraft systems, as do most companies. If you -- and maybe you work for large corporations. I'm sure you've had meetings with people in all corners of the world. You're working together because of what technology has made possible. We are already in a borderless economy. I live it. I have a job at Duke University, yet I live in Silicon Valley. My dean over there allows me to work from anywhere I want to work. I also work for Stanford. I also work for Singularity University. I also have a role at Emory University. I'm able to be at many different places because I can go over the Internet and now teach lectures. I can do research. I can do the things I needed to do. One of the things I've been researching is the role of women in innovation or the lack of women in innovation, the fact that they're left out of the innovation economy. It's something I feel very passionate about. I did a research project. I had a team leader in Washington D.C. I had other researchers in New York City. We needed a website; we got it built at Stanford. And we needed a video. We got it done in Estonia. I want to crowd-create a book. I put the word out there, I'm looking for people to help me with social media. I had 300 women all over the world sign up to be my ambassadors. I wanted to now crowd-edit the book. I had 500 women all over the world telling their stories. I could do within six weeks the research that would have taken me years and years to do by using the power of the Web, by using the power of technology, and by letting people work from anywhere. This is a new world. And I crowd-created a book on innovation. This would have been unconceivable even five years ago. So you talk about the damage that open borders are doing. I'm sorry. It's happening right now. The topic we're talking about is let the jobs do anywhere. No one said, ""Let the migration be anywhere.” No one said that a billion Mexicans have to come to the USA and take our jobs away. Because we have the unskilled jobs, which Bryan will talk more about, and we've got the skilled jobs. The skilled jobs is what most of us in this room do. They can be done anywhere, because we're knowledge workers and we're in a knowledge economy. We're now connected to the Internet. Anything can be done anywhere. And it's happening. Over the last fiveyears, we have not seen a decrease in productivity. We've seen an increase in productivity. I'm more capable right now -- I'm more connected right now. I go on Twitter and I tweet, ""I need some information,"" and I have hundreds of people all over the world now doing my research for me and providing me back what I need. That's the power of connectivity, the Web. That's the world we're in right now. And we have the free flow of information. We have open borders right now on the Internet. That didn't cause our productivity to decrease or our jobs to go away or the catastrophe that, you know, my opponents are saying. It's caused me to be more productive. It causes you to be more productive. It causes you to be smarter. Your children right now have access to the world knowledge. They just get on their iPads or their iPhones and they're connected to everyone else by social media, by Twitter. They're able to go into websites. They're able to gain knowledge from everywhere. They would hire in New Delhi or get video production done in Estonia, like I did. This is a new world we live in. It's all open. And it's not falling apart. We're moving up the ramp. This is the most productive, most innovative period in human history, when the world will come together and start solving problems. There's not going to be a mass migration to America, because as we see, from Mexico, the numbers have actually dropped. As the economy in Mexico rises, there's less incentive for them to come over here. If they can do knowledge work for us where they are and contribute to our intellect and our knowledge, they will do that.  They love being where they are. No one is fleeing to America because, you know, they want to. They do it because they have to. So, let's uplift the whole world. Let's make the world a smaller place and everyone wins. It's a better world. It's a better economy. And we solve major problems."
against,"Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you. It's wonderful to be here in this extremely stimulating company. I'd like to remind Vivek, and the rest of the panel that our proposition tonight is let -- is not Let Anyone Take an Anywhere Job. It's Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere. And I want to ask you to consider what the world would really be like if anyone could take a job anywhere. As a theoretical proposition, it's very attractive. Economic models where other things are always equal show that world GDP would go up. But I'd like us to think about those other things, which in the real world are never equal. As John Donvan and Mr. Rosenkranz said, this is not a debate about immigration. I think immigration is a very good thing for the United States. And almost always it's a very good thing for immigrants. And most of the time, it's even a good thing for the countries that people are leaving, as they send back remittances, and transmit knowledge, and sometimes create companies and jobs in their home countries. But for a debate that's really not -- this debate is really not about immigration. It's about how our societies are organized. Do you think that we should expect our government to try to manage the numbers and the kinds of people who join our societies? I don't mean micromanage. I just mean setting a fair and reasonable framework for the labor market in which both immigrants who come here and people who are born here compete. We shouldn't outsource that very important function of deciding how our societies are organized to employers. That's not to demonize employers. They're the engines of our economies. But it's not their job to pursue the public good, to pursue the best organization for the largest number of people who live in any given country. Labor markets are social institutions as well as economic institutions, and they have geography. Despite the fact that many jobs are mobile, not all jobs are mobile. And especially the jobs that are done by less skilled people into today's world are not mobile. Those jobs in the service sector, the gardeners, the food service workers, the childcare and elder care workers. Those jobs have geography. And we need immigrants to come and fill them. But we need to set a framework in which that's an orderly process, in which it is as much as possible, a legal process. We need to open channels so that the people we need to come and do those jobs can do them legally. But it doesn't mean anyone can take a job anywhere.  Well, as I mentioned, labor markets are social institutions. They're the main channel in our society through which income is distributed. And we have a choice of whether we want to live in a low income, low productivity society with a vastly larger labor market or whether we want to live in a society where people earn higher incomes and have higher productivity and where we import and export and -- including through the web -- of the services that can be done more cheaply elsewhere. Having anyone do a job anywhere, having high levels of immigration to fulfill that vision carries a lot of externalities with it. We don't -- I don't think most people would want to live in a society where immigrants can't have their families join them over long periods of time. We don't want to live in their society where we don't educate the children of immigrants, we don't provide healthcare to immigrants, we don't provide adequate shelter or allow people the means to acquire adequate shelter; so there are costs associated with immigration, not that those costs aren't worth it. I believe they are. But we have to face the fact that building adequate infrastructure, supplying adequate public services takes some planning, takes some funding, takes some upfront costs. And that's a good reason to regulate our -- the intake to our labor markets. I think there is also a question about values in here. I've mentioned some of them already about what kind of society we ought to live in. But it's also about who gets to decide. And I have great sympathy. I work on development issues. I work with refugees. I have great sympathy for Bryan's idea that, you know, it's a moral obligation to let people reach for the same good life that many -- most people have in the United States, at least in relative terms, or in other developed countries. But the fact is that we live in sovereign states. And there's a good reason that we do. In 1648, the system was set up to end centuries of religious wars, to end external interference in the societies, in organized societies. And although we've evolved from the sovereignty of kings to popular sovereignty, I think there's still a question of who gets to decide. And I don't believe it's practical to have the -- to decide for the entire world that we will have the same standard of living. We live in a real world in which immigrants, in which workers are not just units of production. They're members of our societies. And we have to make the kind of provision for people to live in the kind of societies that you want to live in. And, to my mind, is a good reason to vote no against the proposition that anyone should be able to take a job anywhere.   And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is ""Let anyone take a job anywhere."" Remember how you voted at the beginning of the debate on this proposition. We're going to have you vote again after you've heard the arguments. And the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms, in terms of your support of this proposition, will be declared our winner. Now we move on to round two. And round two is where the debaters address each other in turn and take questions from me and from you in the audience. The motion is this: ""Let anyone take a job anywhere."" And arguing for the motion, we've heard Bryan Caplan and Vivek Wadhwa. And they have argued several points. They've come at it several ways. They've argued that actually giving a job to anyone anywhere is common decency. Not to do so is a form of discrimination against foreign workers that in itself violates that decency; that opening borders globally, they cite a statistic that says it would actually double global production, which the other side did not refute. They also say that we're on this road already, that in one sector of the economy, the knowledge economy, that this is already happening. And to quote Vivek Wadhwa, ""The world is not falling apart."" Arguing against the motion, against the motion to let anyone take a job anywhere, we've heard from Kathleen Newland and Ron Unz. They have argued, while conceding the point that productivity, production would double globally, they also say that that would have terrible socially divisive effects because who would it benefit? They argue that that increase in production would benefit almost exclusively an economic elite, that the average person, the ordinary person would see their wages terribly depressed to be essentially in competition with 2 billion workers around the world. And they argue also that employment and labor is a geographically based thing. You have to be in the place. It's social. There are real costs. Who's going to pay for the schooling of these moves of population? Who's going to pay for the healthcare costs? It's not just a matter of individuals being units of labor. Do you really want to give factory owners a decision about how society's organized, or do you want to give it -- I think they were saying -- to legislatures or maybe even kings. So that's where we are on hearing both sides of these arguments. And I want to take -- I want to go back and slice through some of what you were saying and have you interact on some of this. And I'm interested in Bryan Caplan's point when he was arguing for the motion to let anyone take a job anywhere, that not to do so is a form of discrimination against foreign workers. And I want to take that to your opponent, Kathleen Newland, because to a degree, it sounds as though you get what he's saying. And as somebody who works with refugees, you certainly have sympathy for foreign workers. You have an affinityobviously. But why is it not -- why is it not the kind of discrimination that Bryan Caplan was talking about? Well, I think our governments are obliged to discriminate in our favor. That's part of the responsibility of government. That's part of the reason we have governments, to keep external forces from attacking us. That's why we have a national defense. And we have national labor market policies because we want to establish a certain level of living in this country. We don't want people to be paid $2 a day for their work in this country. We don't want workers' rights to be flouted at will, so we have rules, we have regulations, and we exert some control over who and what kind of people can come."
for,"I'm just trying to imagine Kathleen going to Haiti and telling them, look, we need to keep you out because if we let you in, we'd have to give you free healthcare, and I don't feel like doing that. So you have to stay here. And that way we can maintain our standard of living. It just seems like, to anyone that was not already inside of your in group, this argument would be totally unconvincing because it would be so obvious that you really just don't care about them, and you're willing to do almost anything to people outside of your group. Let me put it this way: When parents are judging a sporting event, they take extra effort to not show favoritism to their kids.  Because favoritism is in their hearts. What I'm saying is we need to be equally careful to not show favoritism of this kind to our fellow citizens. We need to make sure that we are treating people from other countries fairly. And this is not what you are doing. You know, the solution is something that Ron -- -- advocated, which is having a minimum wage. He has advocated 12 to 15 dollars. Let’s say we did that. We would now lock out the billions that they're worried about. "
against,"Oh, I -- -- agree entirely. In other words, if we had a very large rise in the minimum wage, maybe to $12 an hour, that by itself would alleviate a lot of the problems associated with immigration because, in a sense, if you have a situation where American workers can't be paid less than, say, $12 an hour, then even a huge amount of foreign competition would insure that ordinary American workers had a reasonable standard of living and maintained it."
for,"So the problem is -- -- the minimum wage allowing people to come in for working for $2 an hour, we didn't say that -- you know, nowhere in this resolution are we talking about bringing in people at 50 cents an hour, $2 an hour, we're talking about if an employer wants to hire them. If I want to hire someone in Chile and have them work for me, they should be allowed to work for me. But you have -- let me say -- Well, why not -- well, you -- -- no one's saying that you have unlimited open borders and anyone can do anything. You have laws, you have customs, you have processes, and you have regulations."
against,"The current minimum wage is too low. In other words, right now if you have a janitor earning nine or 10 or $11 an hour, and if he's suddenly put in competition with two billion workers around the world who are willing to work for anything, his wage would immediately go down to the minimum wage. In other words, all American workers would see their wages drop to the absolute minimum. Labor unions would be destroyed. And the country would be impoverished. I mean if we had a much higher minimum wage, that problem would not be --"
for," So here's the important thing. While it's true -- Absolutely. So if there are really only one kind of labor, then Ron's theory is right, you let in a ton of people and wages go down. However, Ron didn't get to the empirical part of economics, which is a really important part. Here's the thing, there are many different kinds of labor. There are high skilled labor, mid-skilled labor, low skilled labor; you can go and read the most respected critic of immigration in the entire economics profession, George Borjas, and all that he'll tell you is that immigration has been bad for high school dropouts. Everyone else, he says there have been gains. So when you consider the effect of immigration, it's not going to be in effect upon all workers, it's going to be effect upon these narrow segments of workers who I said you could take care of them by having taxes or admission fees for low skilled workers -- Or minimum wages.  Ron's minimum wage idea is terrible, and Ron could tell you why. The whole point of Ron's minimum wage proposal is to keep out low skilled workers. He says it explicitly. I encourage you to read his piece. His goal is to make sure that anyone who is not worth $12 an hour, namely, most of the people on earth, are locked in their countries where they're earning a dollar a day. I think it'd be far better if they could come here and earn --"
against,"No, but I think we see -- I think you have --"
for,Let Ron --
against,"Again, it depends what --"
for,Let me -- I'm sure.
against,"Anyone who has an electrical engineering degree from a good university can take a job anywhere, yes. It's already on your plate --John Donvan: And you're good with that? -- at the higher end, and I'm absolutely good with that. Well, we're not -- but they're not competing with them here. And, really, what I'm -- -- talking about -- -- well -- I think here does matter. The engineer in India, unless, you know, he is at the top level of management, is not getting paid the same as the engineer in the United States. There is an arbitrage going on between --"
for,"But they're equalizing -- salaries keep rising worldwide and if you have more people doing innovation, you solve more problems. The economy rises. This is what's happening worldwide right now. I told you how I became more productive, how I could now crowd-source a book on innovating women by getting women all over the world to help me with it. There's no way I could have done that project if I didn't have access to all these amazing women all over the world. That's the magic that happens when youstop worrying about, you know, restrictions and -- you know, we'd have to block off the Internet to stop the -- -- -- Well, what I -- Her -- The standards are rising. This is what --"
against,"It's not -- but it's, you know, it's not only about their salaries. It's also about that -- if you are an electrical engineer in Haiti and you can make the same salary in Haiti that youwould make in Los Angeles, you still would probably rather live in Los Angeles, where you have a reliable --"

for,The skilled workers don't have to migrate. The Boeing engineers that work in different places are not migrating. They're working together. They're collaborating.
against,You know -- but we're arguing about anywhere here. We're arguing -- -- about geography matters.
for,"-- the same thing. You're looking in the past. You're looking 50 years in the past, when people have to physically move to do jobs. The jobs that all the people in this room do are high-skilled jobs. I don't see any laborers in this room. They are able to do things over the Internet. They are able to do things over e-mail. They're productive over e-mail. They're -- -- you know, they're connecting with each other -- Ron mentioned the declining -- or the stagnant wages over the last 40 years and suggested that immigrant labor supply was the problem. There was a much larger change in labor market over the last 40 years. It's called women entering labor markets. My question for Ron -- so do you think that women entering the labor market was a bad thing for the economy? Was it bad -- did all the gains go to capital? Was it bad for men? I'd like to know."
against,"Well, actually, the -- That's not why wages have declined. That's an interesting point. But I mean, when you -- No -- no -- I want to respond. The sort of wage sectors that have seen sharp declines are not necessarily the ones where there's been large entrance of women. So I tend to doubt that the entrance of a large number of women in the labor force is really the main factor involved. It's a complicated issue, obviously."
for,"Yes, very complicated."
against,"But the bottom line is that -- -- incomes have declined. And it's simply due to job competition. Now, getting back, though, to the point that there was a lot of discussion about, regarding the Internet, I think it's absolutely true that it's impossible to prevent jobs from migrating over the Internet, technologically. You can't stop that type of economic competition from overseas workers. I think it's also true that the wages and benefits of the sort of workers in America who are electrical engineers or software developers has been negatively impacted by foreign job competition over the Internet. I think it's absolutely true. But those workers are among the best paid in the United States. So, the negative impact on them has been relatively mild in terms of society. In other words, electrical engineers right now are very well-paid. But if not for the Internet, if not for Indian job competition, they would even be much better paid. But they're not the people I think we have to worry about. We have to worry about the ordinary workers in the United States, the working class, which is, like, 60, 70, 80 percent of society. They are the ones whose jobs cannot be sent over the Internet. And to exacerbate that problem by having physical job competition as well as Internet job competition would, I think, make things much, much worse for that group."
for,"I conceded it. But the --Ron Unz: Oh, we do. We agree? -- -- unskilled laborer is half of minimum wage. Have some regulations so that people can't abused, just like we have environmental regulations, we have other -- so fix those regulation problems, and now let people work wherever-- if an employer thinks that this Mexican gardener is more qualified to do this job than someone else they can hire locally, let them do it. Why should we try to stop --"
against,It becomes a much less severe problem if you have something like a much higher minimum wage.

against,Not anyone anywhere.
for,"It sounds like we're agreeing. We won already, so --"
against,Anywhere anywhere.
for,"Any movement towards more open immigration is good for me. But I will say the most gains come from immigration from poor countries. Those are where the gaps and earnings are largest. Those are the people whose productivity is only a tiny fraction of what they could accomplish if you'd just let them go to another country. Letting an engineer move from one country to another gives you a small gain in production. Letting an unskilled worker move gives you an enormous increase, because they're stuck in countries where they really just can't use their skills in more than a trivial way. I would agree. I would actually -- I would take any partner. I will dance with anyone, any country that -- any country that we want to open our borders to, I would open our borders to, absolutely. So we just have some regulations which prevent abuse of labor. We do things the American way, and we can now make the world a better place. We uplift the rest of humanity. Just like in Europe, you have a levelization happening, and you didn't have a mass migration of people between countries, as Kathleen just said. So the fact is the model can work. We just need to have the right regulations in effect."
against,But that's because the leveling happened before the opening happened.
for,"Well, let's start leveling the world. Why do we have -- why do we tolerate --"
against,Good idea.
for,"On the skills side, it's already happening. Like I said, the free flow of knowledge is already happening. The fact is that they -- well, that, you know, I get my tax returns -- I have a tax accountant who really outsources the tax processes to India without telling me. It's happening. We have medical transcription happening over there. We have web development happening over there. So any happening in the world income apart, India uplifted, India became a most strategic part of the United States. We became more productive. It was win-win. So all this fear about the world falling apart has not happened. John, if we had the minimum salaries, there would not be a problem. If the United States -- India can have its own minimum salary. As long as you have minimum standards for people, you can let them do a job anywhere. The problem happens when you can have slave labor, cheap labor, when you have Haitian salaries in the United States, then everyone loses. So keep some decent regulations there. Keep our social values. Build a real middle class. This is the beauty of what Ron has been proposing, that under his scheme, we would have a stronger middle class. We've lost that middle class because we have a minimum wage, which is less than it has been for, what, two or three decades, whatever the numbers are.  -- he's worried that they -- that the salaries will go down to zero."
against,"Well, I want -- I do want to respond to Vivek on that. And I -- and in a way, to agree, but it's not a question of anyone being able to take a job anywhere, because this can only work under two -- it can only work two ways. It can work anarchically, which is what I've been arguing against, because that's what's implied by the proposition, is anyone anywhere. Or it can work under highly regulated circumstances. Sweden has a labor market policy that is anyone who is offered a job in Sweden by a legitimate employer can come to Sweden, do that job, live in Sweden. Sweden has a very high tax, highly regulated and high benefit society, which I think actually sound pretty ."
for,"everything, you don't have high taxes. You have relatively low taxes."
against,You can't --
for,And you have a high minimum wage. Problem fixed.
against,"You can't -- you can't --Vivek Wadhwa: Yes, you can do that. And then Ron has demonstrated you can do that. If you your own partner here. I think you -- I think you then get into the arbitrage problem, you know. When somebody is basically taking the difference between a wage here and a wage there and creaming out part of it for their own benefit. This is what happens in international recruitment with these very high fees that are paid by --"
for,"Ron, you need to respond to your partner. And the reason -- -- why that's possible is precisely that it is not legal for them to go under most circumstances."
against,"No, this is -- these are legal workers. These are legal workers."
for,"Under most circumstances, most -- there are very few jobs in Sweden where someone would want to hire someone from another country if they're low skilled precisely because the regulations are so strict. Again, remember, the whole point of Ron's proposal is to price out most people on earth from the U.S. labor market. He says this. So when you talk about the poor conditions of workers of other countries. Remember, Ron's proposal is designed to keep them poor at home. John Donvan:Is that true, Well, not really."
against,"In other words, again, it's a very simple issue. It's a very simple issue. When you have billions of workers legally able to come to the United States and take every -- any job they can that they're offered, you're really converting, again, the minimum wage into a maximum wage because basically very few people in the United States under those circumstances who do ordinary jobs would ever get paid more than the minimum wage."
for,That's right.
against,"Well, again, it depends what you mean. In other words, if you're talking about preventing tens of millions of people coming here and driving down wages, yeah, that's certainly true. I'm trying to prevent that."
for,"Even though they are living in total misery back home, and they would be earning five to 10 times as much as they came here."
against,"It's perfectly true. If you allow an unlimited number of foreign workers to come to the United States and take a job under any circumstances, those foreign workers would benefit. They would end up being much more prosperous than they are right now. But ordinary Americans would be hurt at the same time by a comparable amount.John Donvan: All right. Stop there. Bryan, is that true?"
for,"No, it is not. So if you want to get an idea -- Well -- So since we're in New York, let's talk about one of the greatest open borders experiments in history, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico started out as a third world country. When the United States beat Spain. There was open borders. What has happened? Well, first of all, about half of Puerto Rico left over the course of a hundred years. Secondly, Puerto Rico is now one of the richest countries in the world. What happened? People in Puerto Rico, who otherwise would have been stuck in a third world country, not able to use their skills, many of them left and found that there was a better place for them to work. And those remaining found that their wages were higher. A lot of what happened was that Puerto Ricans went home and turned a third world country into a first world country. There's no reason that America cannot do for the world what it did for Puerto Rico."
against,The whole world? One difference --
for,For the world.
against,"One difference is -- One difference is that Puerto Rico --Bryan Caplan: Give me -- give me a century, and I will give you prosperity over the surface of the earth. Well, it's certainly true. The economy would grow, but the benefits -- the growth would be captured by the factors of production that are not based on labor. It would be captured by capital. In other words, it's the sort of thing where if you suddenly have a vast increase in America's population, population of workers, the economy will obviously be larger. In other words, there'll be more goods, more services, more people buying things; and it's also true that those 10s of millions or even maybe 100s of millions of foreign workers would be much wealthier in the United States than they were back home in China or India or Africa or wherever they were before. But ordinary Americans, the existing -- the current Americans would be dramatically hurt by it. They would be much poorer. So what it really comes down to is whether it's important to safeguard the prosperity of ordinary Americans even at the expense of decreasing the impoverishment of tens or hundreds of millions of people from overseas. I mean, again, the numbers involved would be gigantic. If we had a policy right now that anybody could take a job anywhere, I think we'd be talking about 10, 20, 30 million people coming to the United States in the first few years of something like that. Again, people right now are earning a dollar an hour, 50 cents an hour, 10 cents an hour, and if suddenly they could earn $7 an hour in the United States, it would seem awfully good to them. The people who employ them would drive down the wages, and ordinary workers would be tremendously damaged by it."
for," So the problem is that Ron keeps talking about labor like there's only one kind of labor. So everyone in America is identical to everyone else on earth, so you could be replaced in whatever job you're doing by anyone on earth, but that, of course, is not true. There are many different kinds of labor. Rich countries send out much more skilled workers. So you should expect that skilled workers would be among the beneficiaries of the increase in the supply of lower skilled workers. Now, does this mean that every American will gain? That is much less clear. That's where I said if it's only a minority of Americans who are losing, then it is very feasible to say, ""We will charge you an admission fee or a surtax and give you some compensation."" But what Ron is talking about is keeping out almost everyone on earth and losing all these benefits that we could otherwise have and, of course, trapping most of the world in poverty for no reason."
against,"I think there's certainly a lot of truth to that. And in other words, over history America has benefitted tremendously from, you know, its large scale immigration, and I think probably the immigration we've had over the last 20 or 30 years has been very beneficial in many ways also. But the numbers really are awfully large right now. America right now has one of the most rapidly growing populations anywhere in the first world, much more rapidly growing than most other countries. In fact, for example, that sometimes is distorted. When the New York Times or other people talk about America's growth in GDP and compare it to growth rates in Europe or other countries, they're not talking about per capita GDP, they're talking about total GDP. Right now America's population is growing at twice the rate of China's. So for example when you look at the growth of America's GDP, if it's 2 percent but if the population is growing by 1 percent, the per capita income growth is only 1 percent. The problem is ordinary Americans care about per capita income, not the total GDP of the country. And even if the wealth of America increased by a lot, if we brought in 30 or 40 or 50 million foreign workers, but if the per capita income of ordinary Americans dropped dramatically, that would be disaster. If you basically triple this population of a country, but everybody in the country becomes half as wealthy as they were before, the GDP is much larger, but it is a disaster for ordinary Americans."
for,"But that's not what we're talking about. You keep going to this doomsday scenario where we'll have the Mexican hordes coming in here.  Why not?  That's a great idea. That's the same question that Bryan would ask. Seeing if we're going to now tell the other -- economies of other counties will rise. Things will get better in the rest of the world. There may well be a day when Mexico has a stronger economy than the United States. Now, imagine flipping it on its head, saying Americans can't take a job in Mexico because they happen to be north, west, or south. That's the same type of thinking we're doing right now. Other than trying to uplift anyone and make the world a more equal -- more fair place where everyone is well off, we're talking about restricting ourselves. We're talking about closing our borders. God knows, we'll have a thousand billion people coming to America and taking our jobs away, decimating our salary, that's not how it's ever been. That's not how it will ever be. And if you create a third world country next door to us, if we keep having these restrictive policies, we'll create problems for ourselves. The solution is to uplift Mexico and to have the same initiative as the U.S. and Canada, where we don't worry about people going across borders."
against," Of course. I -- because I do think that the ability to travel for a job is something that is and needs to be a matter of public policy, you know? There needs to be a better consensus on that within countries. And I think that a polity, self-constituted under a sovereign people, have the right to decide what kind of relationship they want to have with other countries. And I would, indeed -- I wish that we knew how to uplift Mexico. I wish that we knew how to eliminate corruption and --"
for,"They're doing it on their own, thank you."
against,-- gang warfare --
for,Mexico doesn't need American handouts. Mexico is rising --
against,"I'm not talking about handouts. -- to spend in Haiti. That would solve all the problems. I couldn't agree with you more. If we knew how and had the will and the resources to level the playing field worldwide, we wouldn't be having this debate, because there wouldn't be a problem."
for,"There is -- -- an easy solution to nation poverty, and that is, let Haitians in, right now."
against," Well, I think that -- again, you know, I don't think we want to live in a country where poverty is tolerated. And I don't think we -- and in order not to have poverty in our midst, I think we have to have a framework whereby the immigrants that we do admit -- and we admit a lot, and I'm glad of it. And I would like to see us admit more. But I don't think that we can create the kind of framework for a good society, for the kind of society we want to live in. Our immigration policy is only as good as our integration policy. And our integration policy for immigrants that makes them part of our society on equal terms is not something we can do for the whole world."
for,"And Kathleen -- So, Kathleen, you seem like a very nice person. You've been to Calcutta.  You know how horrible things there are. I find it very strange to say that it's so important that we not have to look at you, that we're going to keep you living here in horrible poverty because you might come to America and earn minimum wage. It seems crazy to me. You know, the U.S. system is broken. Maybe it worked a long time ago. There was a time when there was no such thing as visas. There were no passports. You could easily come to the United States. And that's when the U.S. developed into the powerhousethat it is. Most recently, there has been lots of problems with the number of visas, all these restrictions. We now have a reverse brain drain going on. We have skilled talent leaving the country because we won't give them enough visas. We have this protectionist sentiment. Now we have a clogged Congress which can't even keep the government open, let alone do rational immigration reform. Because why? Because you have a small segment of American society which believes that if we open the doors, billions will come in. They'll take our jobs away, and this country will go to the dogs. I mean, this is the problem we have right now. System is not functioning. It's broken right now. Right now, as of the last two or three years, it's broken."
against,"I -- can I just -- -- say one thing about that. I think the U.S. system leaves a lot to be desired. I think it does need fixing. But I don't see why we should replace it with a system that's completely employer driven. And that is it, you know, let anyone take a job anywhere means- it means that employers set the terms of -- -- immigration. Well, currently, in the United States, our immigration system is overwhelmingly driven by family reunification. And that means that 70 percent of the people who get a green card, about 10 percent of them are refugees, about 14 percent are selected by employers. 14 percent, that's all we have now. And yet we still get the best and the brightest, a larger proportion of the best and the brightest than any other country. Now, we may not get them all. We may not get as many as we need. We may not get as many as we could, but we get a lot."
for,They're going back now. We're now in reverse.
against,"Well, we're not in reverse."
for,"And employers are not evil. Employers are -- as long as you have regulations and have minimum levels, employers are not going to bring in people from abroad when they can hire equally competent better people here. They don't want the cultural problems. They don't want to have the costs involved with it. They don't have to -- want to have to pay for the health insurance when they don't have to. They will do what's right for them. And there's nothing wrong with letting employers select the people they want to hire."
against,"That's what I'm saying. Because it's not the job of employers to pursue the public good. It's the job of the employers to pursue the good of their companies. That's as it should be. That is part of what accounts for the dynamism of our economy. But they don't have a responsibility for the integration of immigration. They don't have a responsibility for the families of immigrants. They don't -- and when you bring people in through a family channel -- and I think we probably overdo it on that. But when you bring them in, you have an integration machine that gets going there. People are coming into a community. They're coming into a family. They're coming into a social system."
for,I've been an employer who has hired foreign workers. I hired lots of people from the UK in the '90s from Britain. And I took responsibility for making sure that their families came here and making sure they had health coverage.
against,You're unusual.
for,"Making sure that they integrated, there weren't cultural issues. But that's what employers do. The employers aren't evil. They're not going to bring in slave labor just to cut some costs. They're going to do what makes sense for them and for their companies, where integration has to happen."
against,"I suggest you go to the Central Valley in California, not just Silicon Valley."
for,"We're talking about the rest of America. You know, we keep coming back to farmworkers. Let's not just say because of some abuse in some segments of America we shut off -- we close the doors, and we start --"
against,"No, I'm not suggesting that."
for,"-- are going to come in and take farm jobs away. If we have minimum wages, if we have regulations, if we now require them to have -- provide health insurance, these things will not happen.  So first thing when you think about brain drain is, when people complain about it, they really are asking us to do to the people in the third world what the Soviet Union did to its own citizens. It's a scary thought. However, you could say, well, it was very good for the Soviet Union to keep their smart people in. At least they didn't get to run away. But I would say, you know, more important -- the more fundamental plight is that the -- letting smart people go to other countries actually creates benefits for not only themselves, not only the world economy, but for people back home. So Kathleen mentioned remittances. And if you just want to get an idea about how it works, take a look at Puerto Rico; started out as a third world country. do employers making job offers and then -- and people taking jobs.  We're not saying -- come here -- -- and then look for a job, I mean --"
against,"It's not a member of the European Union. I'm so glad to have a question from Moldova. I've been working there a lot in the last year. I've been there four times so I want to talk to you afterwards. The -- it's really the other way around. The United States was a model for the European Union, and in a sort of fundamental sense of trying to reach the economies of scale, the continental economies of scale, that the European Union -- that the United States had by virtue of being one country, so the European Union has gradually eliminated first, you know, its tariff barriers, and tried to integrate into its coal and steel industries at the very beginning. And finally this is the last step to integrate its labor markets. So I think they are still struggling. There have been a lot of strains particularly with the broadening to -- at -- with the more shallow preparation efforts for new entrants like Croatia and Romania and Bulgaria compared to Italy, France, and -- Italy and Greece and Spain. So it's not with a lot of strain, but I think they are becoming -- striving to have markets more like ours rather than us looking to Europe as a model. We also have the huge advantage of having one language."
for,"The migration policy -- -- of the European Union has been fantastic. My only complaint is that they keep out most poor countries. We have employer laws. We have the laws for sick leave. We have employer laws for maternity. We have laws for health care. We have a minimum wage. Let's just tweak it a little bit and now move on. It's not that -- it's not rocket science. We're talking about as many -- -- employees as employers need. And we're not talking about billions of people. We're talking about reasonable numbers of people coming here, taking jobs when they're offered jobs. I don't -- you know, there's no -- I don't see why we keep talking about billions coming in. We -- no one is saying, ""Just open the borders and let people come here, and live, and we have to give them health care.” We're saying that if there's a job here for them, let them take the job. That's -- it's as simple as that. I don't know why we even have to debate this. It's a simple argument. If an employer wants it --"
against,That is really scheming. I mean -- -- that's really complicated.
for,"With all these doomsday scenarios, to close off the borders? Come on. That's an extreme situation again. This is the same as the Tea Party --"
against,"Over the last 20, or 30, or 40 years, there's been a tremendous bifurcation of American society. The wealthier have gotten much wealthier. The rest of the people have not. We've reached the point right now where the top 1 percent of American society -- which has sometimes been in the headlines -- the top 1 percent has as much wealth as the bottom 95 percent. In the last few years, since the 2008 financial crisis, virtually all of the gains in wealth in income have gone to that wealthy elite and virtually none of it to the rest of the population. Now, that's a bad situation. To make a bad situation like that much worse would be to cause the vast majority of ordinary American workers to suddenly have to compete for their jobs against everybody in the rest of the world. It would destroy their incomes. What we're talking about, again, is something that certainly would benefit the best educated, the wealthy elite, the affluent people in society, to be honest. The proposal that we're talking about probably would benefit many -- perhaps even the majority, perhaps even the vast majority of the people sitting here in this audience. I mean, we're talking about New York City, one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. We're talking about the sort of people who attend a debate like this. Many of you might not be wealthy right now, but you're young in your careers. You certainly have a lot of prospects. Probably many of you would benefit from something that would drive down the wages and income of 60, 70, 80 percent of the rest of the people in society, but it would make the political situation much worse than it is right now. What we have to do is make changes and other proposals and other aspects of our society to alleviate the problems we've had over the last 20 or 30 years, in terms of this wealth gap. Not make them much worse. The proposal we're talking about would be devastating to the vast majority of Americans and should be voted against.John Donvan: Thank you, Ron Unz."
for,"Right through American history, we've had these same debates, that foreigners will take American jobs away. We always blamed foreigners for all the ills. And now my friend over there is blaming foreigners for the income disparity between the rich and the poor. Immigrants haven't done that. That's the evil Wall Street that's done that, my friend. That's a different problem in American society. We can have a balanced immigration policy, which allows people in that makes sense for America, that make it more competitive to come in here. It's happened with skilled immigration. Skilled immigration has made America the most fiercely competitive land in the world. We're seeing benefits from it. It's uplifting society. A lot of good has come from skilled immigration. We're moving into this knowledge economy in which we really tested what happens with open borders. The fact that we're communicating, connecting with people everywhere. Our children are now connected to children in the poorest parts of the world because of open borders, which is the internet. So closing off borders, saying that, no, you can't have people taking a job, you know, where they need to, is like closing off the internet. It doesn't make sense in this -- in this modern day era. It's good for America. It's made what is -- America what it is. Let's get beyond this protectionism. Let's get beyond this close mindedness and blaming foreigners. There's billions of Mexicans that are going to come in and take our jobs away. They're going to decimate our standard of living.  They have made this country fiercely competitive, made this country great. Let's do more of it, not less of it. We can control wages. We can have minimum wages so that we don't have them going down to zero, we don't have fierce competition for low-skilled jobs. American employers are not able. American employers are doing what's best for their employees and for themselves and for their investors. We can trust them to hire people that make sense for them. Let'snot try to overregulate the employer. Let's open up so that we bring in the people that we need in this great country."
against," I think in order to decide how to vote on this proposition of ""Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere,"" we need to think about what the alternatives are. And the alternative, I think, is a better managed, a more thoughtful labor market policy, a more thoughtful immigration policy. As I said before, currently only 14 percent of our immigration intake, the number of permanent residency permits that are granted every year are granted to immigrants who are sponsored by an employer. So increase that. So increase our intake of skilled people, but not to the exclusion of poor -- many of the family members who come into our dominant family stream are not wealthy people. Their children do well. They become the bedrock of this society. And I couldn't agree more with Vivek's statement that immigration has been a tremendous benefit to America. But what we need is a thoughtful, measured, targeted immigration and labor market policy. And I think that that needs to be a public policy framework that is set through public debate, like this one, and where people other than only employers have a say inwho comes in to be our neighbors and who and how many people constitute and reconstitute and renew American society."
for,"As Vivek said, it is hard to believe that we're actually even debating ""let anyone take a job anywhere."" If our opponents had told you that the laws prevent women from working, or the laws prevent Jews from working, or the laws prevent blacks from working, you wouldn't just disagree. You would be appalled. You would be horrified to hear such words coming out of their mouth. You should be equally appalled when someone says the laws prevent foreigners from working. Criminalizing the employment of women, Jews, blacks or foreigners is doubly evil. It denies workers' basic human rights. And it deprives the world of the full benefit of workers' talent and ambition. Open borders should be a bipartisan and bi-ideological cause. Conservatives should oppose immigration restrictions in the name of freedom, free markets, small government, the work ethic, meritocracy and to Horatio Alger himself. Liberals should oppose immigration restrictions in the name of equality. Reducing poverty, equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, social justice and the global 99 percent. When the government forbids American farmers to hire Mexican farmworkers, how can a conservative not see the oppressive hand of big government crushing the entrepreneurial spirit? When the government forbids American restaurants to hire Haitian dishwashers, how can a liberal not see a heartless legal system, diabolically promoting poverty and discrimination? Please, let anyone take a job anywhere. It is the right way to treat your fellow human beings. It will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing.  And that concludes closing statements. And now it is time to see which side you feel argued best. I want you to go again to the key pads at your seat and vote now the second time. Remember it's the difference between the two votes that determines our winner. And the way the vote works, if you look at this motion: Let anyone take a job anywhere, and if, after hearing the arguments, you agree with it, you're agreeing with this team, push number one. If you do not agree with this motion, you agree with this team, push number two. And if you are or became undecided, push number three. If you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. The system will register your last vote before we lock it out. All right.  It looks like everybody's done. We're about 90 seconds away from having the results. The first thing I want to do is say that it's our goal at Intelligence Squared to raise the level of public discourse by bringing real argumentation and respect and robust ideas and logic and wit. And we had that tonight. These debating -- these two teams were just terrific.  I don't want to take your job away, my friend."
